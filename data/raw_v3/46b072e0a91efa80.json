(forum.gitlab.com) is a platform for users to register, ask questions, and collaborate, embodying GitLab’s values of transparency and community contribution. It features a trust-based system, moderation workflows, and various tools for organizing discussions, such as categories and tags. The forum encourages engagement from both the wider community and GitLab team members, aiming to build a knowledge-sharing environment while maintaining a code of conduct and clear administrative processes.\nUsers\nRegistration and Login\nWider community members can register for an account on the\ncommunity forum\nby using the\nSign up\nbutton and choosing their preferred method (email, oauth, etc.).\nFor GitLab team members it is recommended to use the\nwith GitLab\noauth method. This will authenticate against GitLab.com as oauth provider, prefill the profile being created, and later serve as oauth login. This method also grants additional permissions, see the administration section for\nusers\nbelow. Alternatively, manual sign-up using the\ngitlab.com\naddress and setting up 2FA will work as well.\nCode of Conduct and FAQ\nOur\nCommunity Code of Conduct\napplies to the forum platform. When in doubt,\nflag posts\nwhich violate the Code of Conduct or are inappropriate in other ways (spam, advertising, etc.). Moderators can review the posts and take action while the posts are hidden from public viewing.\nDiscourse provides a general\nFAQ\nfor users.\nHow to respond in the GitLab Forum\nVisit the\nforum\nand navigate into the categories. Alternatively, use\nNew\n,\nLatest\nand\nUnread\nsearch filters.\nWrite a response if you can, or involve a team member for assistance on the issue if you don’t know how to engage or proceed. Troubleshooting questions and asking for details counts as a reply! Don’t feel like you have to answer fully in one go.\nConsider using some of the following resources to help get answers to questions:\nSearch the forum for related topics - you may find a community member who has already solved something similar. You can loop them into the conversation or point the user to a thread that might be helpful\nSearch\nGitLab’s documentation\nfor helpful information to aid in troubleshooting\nWorking alongside the wider community\nIn the GitLab Community Forum, most tech support and troubleshooting assistance comes from community members volunteering their time and knowledge to help others.\nIf you see a community member volunteering their time to help another community member, give their reply a ❤️ to show appreciation for their contribution.\nFlagging Inappropriate Content\nIf any GitLab team member sees a forum post that is inappropriate, abusive, spam, or a violation of our code of conduct, please flag the post by clicking the flag icon. The post is automatically hidden from public viewing and added to the\nmoderation\nqueue for review. If the flagging action requires more context or immediate actions, contact\nadmins\nin the\n#developer-relations\nSlack channel.\nIf immediate action to hide or redact private information is required, flag the post and then ping one of the\nadmins\nin the\n#developer-relations\nSlack channel.\nBest Practices\nAlways be courteous and generous, especially when a user is new to the forum. You can recognize new users (and dormant users) by the blue, temporary banner at the top of their posts.\nAdd a welcome message when replying to new users. It could be as simple as “Hi, and welcome to the forum! 😄” at the start of your post.\nUse the like button (the heart icon) as much as you can, to thank users for their input and to inspire other users to do the same.\nUse the solution checkbox button as much as you can, to indicate to others when a forum topic has an answer.\nThank users publicly for providing answers to questions, especially when they are not in the GitLab Staff group.\nModeration\nThe moderation privileges should only be used to pin topics or make (global) announcements.\nModerators\nshare different responsibilities, and categories. If you need help or guidance, please reach out in the\n#developer-relations\nSlack channel.\nReviews\nDiscourse implements an intelligent spam prevention system, which leads to users and posts behind hold for review. The same workflow applies when users flag a post manually. Items for review are indicated with a red count in the upper right menu, and can be access directly with the\nReview\nsection.\nTopics unrelated to GitLab, DevOps, etc. and text with many external URLs often is spam.\nTake action with\nDelete User > Delete and Block User\n. This also deletes the post.\nThere are bots which copy the body text of another topic or reply, and create their own new topic with a new URL. Discourse detects them as\nNew user typed their first post suspiciously fast, suspected bot or spammer behavior.\nTake action with\nDelete User > Delete and Block User\n.\nFalse positives\nShort replies such as\nMe too.\nA copy-pasted question from a different platform.\nA user without posts but a profile picture and a personal biography/website\nSuggested action: Approve the posts/users.\nA post was flagged as CoC violation.\nReview the post. When in doubt, ask in\n#coc-violations\nin Slack.\nEdit\nthe post and follow the\nCode of Conduct Templates\nto replace the text.\nUser Review Tips\nWhen the user account looks suspicious, these tips can help with verification:\nSearch the user avatar picture to verify it is not a stock photo.\nTinEye\nprovides a reverse image search.\nCompare username, real name, GitLab username (when provided), email address, biography for human input.\nBots and spam users often add URLs and text to their biography.\nDifferent used names may indicate a fake profile.\nWith admin permissions:\nOn the user profile, open the admin interface. Inspect the user profile’s IP address with the Discourse built-in Whois lookup including geo location. When in doubt, use a search engine with\nwhois <IP address>\nand also verify the ASN and its ISP. Sometimes a google search unveils them belonging to a fraud friendly environment, or other insightful details.\nModerator Specific Permissions\nClick this link to view the Moderator Quick Start guide.\nThis guide explains Moderator permissions, expectations, and best practices.\nModerator Specific Non-Technical Contributions\nWelcome new members\nCheck forum threads for an existing answer: if there is an answer already, consider liking it or marking as solved\nReassign categories on the forum\nAdd or create appropriate tags\nLook in the forum for answers that may have already been supplied in an existing thread\nLook in the Support Zendesk instance for answers that may have already been supplied in a ticket from Support\nAsk the poster initial troubleshooting questions like screenshots, error messages, etc.\nGeneral Moderator Best Practices\nLeave all interactions and replies open-ended. We want our forum users to feel like they can always come back and pick up the conversation.\nConsider gifting swag\nto forum users that contribute a lot or in a really exceptional way! Do this via a DM/private message.\nModerator Only Access\nBelow is a list of actions only forum Moderators can take in the Discourse platform. For this reason, at this time only GitLab Staff members are granted Moderator status.\nMarking accepted solutions\nMark a response as an “accepted solution” in a situation where a single reply effectively answers or resolves a forum thread. Only the original poster and moderators have the ability to mark an answer in a forum thread. Please do this freely! It helps with SEO, and it helps our users know what questions have been answered.\nInstructions\nClick the ellipsis in the small grey toolbar on the post > click the checkbox.\nEditing topics and posts\nSometimes users will accidentally post private information like license or API keys, emails addresses, etc. Publicly identifiable information needs to be redacted from the forum. You can also use this tool to redact inappropriate language or other Code of Conduct violations.\nInstructions\nIf you need to edit a user’s post for whatever reason, please private message the user in the forum letting them know that you have done so, and the reason why.\nClick the ellipsis in the small grey toolbar on the post > click the pencil icon.\nInstructions For Sending a Private Message\nClick the user’s avatar icon, user card will appear\nClick the\nmessage\nbutton on the user card to draft private message\nThe edit history diff is only visible to moderators.\nViewing email addresses\nFor the sake of anonymity, only Forum Moderators can see the email address associated with a forum user’s account.\n*\nInstructions\nClick the user’s avatar icon, user card will appear\nClick the avatar icon on the user card to navigate to the user’s profile\nClick the\nshow\nbutton in the user’s profile\nDrafting in/using the private Staff Category\nThis is not exclusive to Moderators, but you can use the Staff Category to draft new knowledge share articles, initiatives, whatever you need! You will notice the little lock symbol next to private categories.\nDeleting topics and posts\nWe do not delete topics and posts in the forum, mainly due to the fact that this action can destroy trust. There are always exceptions to this rule - a good example is when spam posts sneak in. If you feel something needs to be deleted, you can always reach out to\nadmins\nin private or in the\n#developer-relations\nSlack channel and we can talk it through!\nInstructions\nClick the ellipsis in the small grey toolbar on the post > click the trash can icon.\nMoving Posts To a New Thread\nIt’s not uncommon that moderators will feel the need to move new posts out of old threads, or move posts to their own topic altogether. Please move new posts out of old topics when users try to bring topics a year or older back to life.\nInstructions\nClick wrench icon on right side of UI\nClick\nselect post\nin dropdown\nChoose either\nselect+below\nor\nselect\ndepending on how much of the conversation you want to move\nChoose\nmove\nto Fill out the popover accordingly\nClick\nmove to new topic\nWorkflow\nModerator and Admin Workflow\nHow and when to edit forum posts.\nGenerally, we do not edit other peoples’ posts. If we see something that can be improved, we should reach out to them privately to ask them to change it. This helps us build trust with our community and with the GitLab team, since it shows them that they have the creative freedom and autonomy to post what they like on our forum.\nThat being said, there are instances when moderators can edit posts directly. Here are some examples and how to do it:\nViolation of GitLab’s\nCode of Business Conduct & Ethics\nand\nEvents Code of Conduct\n(Ex. redacting swear words, if they are unable or unwilling to edit it themselves)\nRedact private information (Ex. license keys, account info, email addresses, etc.) reported in\nGDPR requests\nEditing can be achieved via the grey pencil icon in the post toolbar (… > pencil)\nHow and when to mark a solution in a thread.\nWhen there is a clear answer to the topic and/or question\nMarking the solution can be done via the grey checkbox icon in the post toolbar (… > checkbox)\nHow and when to delete a forum post or topic.\nPlease do not delete other’s posts. When necessary, message the user first, and let them have a chance to delete it themselves\nDeleting content for any reason is a breach of trust, which is something we are working hard to build in our forum community. If you feel like a post needs to be deleted, please reach out to an Admin, so the situation can be discussed.\nFollow the relevant workflow depending on the question:\ngraph TD\nA((Non-support)) --> B\nB(\"Account\") --> |Sales/Renewal| E[\"ping #sales\"]\nB --> |Other|F(\"Have they opened a support ticket?\")\nF --> |Yes, using GitLab.com| G[\"ping #support_gitlab-com\"]\nF --> |Yes, self-managed| H[\"ping #support_self-managed\"]\nF --> |No| I[\"Direct them to support.gitlab.com\"]\nA --> J(\"GitLab vs Competitor\")\nJ --> |Question|K[\"Find answer via DevOps tools page/blog and link\"]\nJ --> |Discussion|L[\"Link on #competition\"]\nA --> M(\"Feature Proposal\")\nM --> |Already exists|N[\"Link to the open issue\"]\nM --> |Doesn't exist|O[\"Ask them to open an issue\"]\ngraph TD\nA((Support)) --> B(\"What level of GitLab are they on?\")\nB --> |Not free|C(\"Have they opened a support ticket?\")\nC -->|No| E[\"Link them to the support portal\"]\nC -->|Yes| F(\"Have they provided the ticket number?\")\nF --> |No|R(\"Ask them for the ticket number\")\nR --> F\nF --> |Yes|G(\"Self-Managed or .com?\")\nG --> |Self-Managed|H[\"ping #support_self-managed\"]\nG --> |.com|I[\"ping #support_gitlab-com\"]\nG --> |not provided|J(\"Ask what they're using\")\nJ --> G\nB-->|Free| D(\"Is there an issue open already?\")\nD --> |Yes|K[\"Link the issue\"]\nD --> |ask the following questions|L(\"Self-Managed or .com?\")\nL --> M(\"What version are they on?\")\nM --> N(\"Has this happened on a previous version?\")\nN --> O(\"How long have they been experiencing it?\")\nO --> P(\"What integrations do they have, if relevant?\")\nP --> |Questions answered|Q[ping relevant product channel]\nForum Community Response Workflow\nCommunity response situations\ninclude preparing a forum topic as a draft in the\nInternal\ncategory.\nTeam members need to sign-up for a\nforum account\nin order to create a topic. The Internal category allows team members review and edit the draft together without it being available to the public.\nAfter a forum topic is created in the Internal category, team members have the ability to edit the title, tags, description, post timestamp, and category.\nTo edit the title, category, or tags of the topic, click the pencil icon on the top.\nTo edit the description, use the pencil icon at the bottom of the topic next to ‘Reply’. Note that the pencil icon may be collapsed within the ellipsis menu.\nEditing a topic description only is available for\ntrust level 4\nand moderators. Ask an administrator to update the\nteam member trust level\nif necessary.\nA sandbox topic to test editing is available\nhere (internal)\n.\nForum Banner Announcements\nSteps for bannering on Discourse:\nDownload design component to your computer\nIn Discourse navigate to Admin Panel > Customize > Themes > Top Navbar\nUnder uploads, click the\nAdd+\nbutton\nAdd your design\nClick\nEdit CSS/HTML\nAdd mini banner CSS:\n.\nmini-banner__image\n{\nheight\n:\n60.5\npx\n;\nwidth\n:\n720\npx\n;\nbackground-image\n:\nurl\n(\n$mini-banner\n);\nbackground-size\n:\n100\n%\n100\n%\n;\nmargin\n:\n0\nauto\n;\n}\nClick\nAfter Header and add this div to make CSS work\n<\ndiv\nclass\n=\n\"main-banner\"\n>\n<\na\nhref\n=\n\"https://forum.gitlab.com\"\n>\n<\ndiv\nclass\n=\n\"main-banner__image\"\n></\ndiv\n>\n</\na\n>\n<\na\nhref\n=\n\"https://forum.gitlab.com/t/ci-cd-minutes-for-free-tier/40241\"\ntarget\n=\n\"__blank\"\n>\n<\ndiv\nclass\n=\n\"mini-banner__image\"\n></\ndiv\n>\n</\na\n>\n</\ndiv\n>\nSlight modifications may be needed depending on the size of the image\nAdministration\nDeveloper Relations DRIs: @sugaroverflow @dnsmichi\nTech stack owners\n: @sugaroverflow @dnsmichi\nForum staff members\nDiscourse Platform\nThe Discourse instance\nforum.gitlab.com\nis operated by the Discourse team on\ntheir SaaS platform\n. The Discourse platform was started as self-hosted instance in 2015, and later\nmigrated to Discourse SaaS in February 2020\n. The domain is managed by the GitLab infrastructure team.\nUpdates and important security fixes are applied by the\nDiscourse hosting team\n. Technical owners can reach out to their support team. For business organization and subscription updates, please open\na confidential issue in the Developer Advocate Meta Project\n.\nIn October 2021, the Discourse forum exceeded 1 million monthly page views. More metric reports can be created using the\nAdmin dashboard\n.\nUser Trust Levels\nDiscourse uses\ntrust levels\nto grant more trust permissions to users as they evolve on using and engaging on the forum platform. This trust system also helps to keep spam users away, ensuring a safe place to discuss and help each other.\nNew users start at level 0, and can only post a few topics and replies, and need to engage by reading topics to earn trust level 1.\nTrust level 1 grants the permission to send DMs, upload images, flag posts, etc. as basic user.\nMembers with trust level 2 have spent time on the forum, helped users with responses, receive and give likes, and read more about GitLab topics.\nTrust level 3 as a regular user means becoming a GitLab community evangelist with visiting often, leading the path with helpful responses, engaging with likes and feeling energized.\nLeaders with trust level 4 have earned their trust by staff team member nomination, helping with questions, engaging with likes, flagging posts to moderators, lending a hand to new users, and overall collaborate closely with GitLab team members.\nNomination for Trust Level 4\nPlease open a\nnew issue in the Developer Advocate Meta Project\nand share the user profile URL and a detailed reason why they should be promoted to trust level 4. Assign the issue to technical owners using this quick action:\n/assign @dnsmichi @sugaroverflow\n. Administrators will review and reach out to nominated community members.\nTeam Member Trust Level\nGitLab team members who signup using oauth, will automatically be added to the\ngitlab-team\ngroup, granting\ntrust level 3\n. This group does not trigger any @-mention notifications in forum posts.\nAdministrators can promote team members to trust level 4 manually, for example when needed for\ncommunity response workflows\n.\nCore team members trust level\nCore team members can be added to the\ncore-team\ngroup through the\nCore team onboarding process\n. This action grants\ntrust level 3\n. This group does not trigger any @-mention notifications in forum posts.\nCategories\nThe\nforum categories\nallow to group posts by sections and topics. Users can also subscribe to category notifications. The top-level categories are inspired by the DevSecOps lifecycle, common questions about GitLab features, and community activities.\nCategories are also shown in a dropdown when users follow the\nNew topic\naction on the forum landing page. We try to keep the category list short and concise.\nThere are two categories serving a special purpose, they must not be removed:\nInternal\nis required for the\ncommunity response workflow\nStaff\nis used by Discourse to manage site content and permissions (example:\nFAQ\n.\nFor requesting a new category, please review the following steps:\nDo you want to filter specific topics, or subscribe to notifications? If yes, please consider using\ntags\ninstead.\nNew categories should fit as subcategory into the existing top-level categories. We try to avoid bigger layout changes to avoid breaking contributor workflows.\nCreate a\nnew issue in the Developer Advocate Meta Project\nto discuss, and add details about forum DRIs, expected topic count, and impact. Assign the issue to technical owners using this quick action:\n/assign @dnsmichi @sugaroverflow\n.\nCategory Topic Templates\nDiscourse supports\ncategory topic templates\n, similar to GitLab description templates in issues/epics/MRs. Templates are used to guide users in providing all details for  questions (configuration, steps to reproduce, versions, etc.) which enables forum contributors to help more efficiently. The categories focus on support (“How to use GitLab”, etc.), community engagement and programs, GitLab University. A general catch-all category guides users to select specific categories as default template.\nAdministrators can edit each category, and navigate into\nTemplates\nto modify the templates. Sub categories require a copy of the top-level templates, ensuring that all categories use templates by default. In the past, we had users specifically selecting categories without templates, creating new topics in the wrong place.\nAll templates are persisted in the\ndiscourse-assets Git repository\n, and provide templates for the top level categories.\nSteps to update a category topic template:\nNavigate into the category settings, and choose\nTemplates\n.\nEdit the template and preview the changes.\nSave the template and test to create a new topic in the category.\nPersist the changes in the\ndiscourse-assets Git repository\n.\nTags\nUsers can add tags to topics; higher trust levels also allow tag creation. Users can filter topics by tag, and subscribe to tag notifications too. This helps with specific workflows for docs and blog teams.\nThe tag group\nfeedback\nincludes the following tags:\ndocs-feedback\nis used by the technical writing team to invite for docs.gitlab.com feedback.\nblog-feedback\nis embedded on the GitLab blog footer as CTA for feedback.\nSettings\nAdministrators can modify the\nDiscourse settings\n. Please open a\nnew issue in the Developer Advocate Meta Project\nto suggest, discuss and document changes. Note that plugins are installed by contacting Discourse Support.\nThe\nOnly show overridden\ncheckbox can be helpful to see modified settings. The most notable changes are documented below.\nRequired: Title, site description, contact email, company name\nBranding: logo, favicon, etc.\nBasic setup: allow user locale, ga universal tracking code, top menu, category colors, fixed category positions, enable whispers, short title\nLogin: GH login, oauth2 enabled (GitLab oauth via\ndiscourse-oauth2-basic\n)\nUsers: reversed usernames, hide suspension reasons, use email for username and name suggestions\nPosting: min post/topic title length, do not allow uncategorized topics, post edit time limit, do not show edit history to public, max reply history, newuser max replies/mentions per topic, newuser max links/embedded media/max attachments\nEmail: alternative reply by email addresses\nFiles: authorized extensions, do not download remote images to local, purge deleted uploads grace period days\nSecurity: Allow moderators to manage categories and groups, allowed iframes, enforce second factor for staff\nSpam: Hide post sensitivity, newuser spam host threshold, max new accounts per registration ip\nRate Limits: rate limit new user create post\nUser Preferences: Enable mailing list mode\nPlugins: allow solved on all topics, assign allowed on groups, data explorer enabled\nUser Admin\nAdmins can search for users, and verify the profiles when reviewing the moderation queue.\nThe groups are also managed in this section.

This workflow is also linked in the\nforum FAQ\n.\nTeam members who handle the personal data request can reach out to\nforum admins\nfor data or account deletion requests. Forum admins can then take action.\nForum users with more than one post cannot delete their account themselves. Trust level 0 and 1 users cannot edit their posts after a grade period. Forum admins must anonymize, redact, and delete posts manually in these cases. These settings are to preserve the forum and discussion integrity, and\nfighting spam on Discourse\n.\nDiscourse provides different paths to handle GDPR requests.\nUser account deletion:\nOption 1, default: Since profile posts might include personal data as well, admins can decide delete all posts, and then delete the user account too.\nOption 2, for many posts and topics: Anonymize the account in the admin user profile view. This resets the user profile, removing personal data (email, name, etc.). Redact all personal information in the posts and keep the topic history intact.\nTopic deletion or edits:\nNavigate into the topic from the requestor, and use the edit button to modify the post.\nAlternatively, delete the entire topic.\nProjects\nFighting spam on Discourse\nSee the\ninternal handbook\nfor analysis, strategies and actions.\nConnect with us in Slack\nJoin\n#developer-relations\n.\nLast modified June 30, 2025:\nForum workflow: Document how to handle GDPR personal data requests (\na9e55b81\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
