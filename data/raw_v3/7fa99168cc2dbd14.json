You will be responsible for paying any premiums that may exceed the 350 AUD applied subsidy.\nPlan rates can be seen through the\nGitLab BUPA employer portal\nwhen reviewing your plan & extra options.\nPayment details will be required to complete your enrollment process on BUPA.\nEnrolling\nStarting on 2023-07-27, Australian team members will be able to review their plan options & rates, elect their hospital plan & extra option, and enroll directly on\nBUPA’s employer portal\nfor GitLab.\nhttps://www.bupa.com.au/corporate/gitlab\nClick on “Get a quote” and go through the 6 quick registration questions (residency status, single or family coverage, DOB, State, income bracket, contact details).\nOnce you confirm your details, you’ll be able to view your hospital & extra options, plan pdf summaries, extra highlights, and their monthly plan rates (please ensure “paying” is set to “monthly”).\nOnce you “select and proceed” your preferred coverage, click “join now”\nYou’ll then need to complete BUPA’s application process to complete your enrollment: Contact & Medicare details, Rebate application, Payment details, Current health cover information.\nLeavers\nFor Team Members leaving GitLab, their last day on the GitLab BUPA group will be their termination date, however team member’s health insurance remains in place, with the full cost of cover being their responsibility.

Effective 1 July 2025, the superannuation rate is set at 12% of the team member’s total salary, with a quarterly cap of $7,500 AUD. Super is on top of the salary listed in the compensation calculator/contract.\nSuperannuation payments due dates\nSuper payment due dates has been a common topic in\n#loc_australia\n. However, there is no reason to worry when payments do not happen monthly as they may be done quarterly.\nThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) states the following:\nYou pay super for eligible employees calculated from the day they start with you. You must make the payments at least four times a year, by the quarterly due dates.\nPayments due dates can be found on the\nATO website\n.\nSuperannuation Salary Sacrifice\nTeam members in Australia have the option to make concessional super contributions by sacrificing some of their pre-tax pay and arrange to have it paid into their superfund instead. Effective July 1, 2024 the combined total of GitLab and salary sacrificed contributions\nmust not be more than $30,000\n, per financial year.\nSalary Sacrifice FAQ\nHow do I make concessional contributions to my superannuation?\nEmail\ntotal-rewards@gitlab.com\nwith the percentage or amount of your salary that you would like to sacrifice.\nCan I change the amount or opt out?\nYes, if you wish to change the amount/percentage or opt out, simply send\ntotal-rewards@gitlab.com\nan email.\nIs it possible to start from any month?\nYes, it would be processed on the next available payroll.\nDoes the payroll provider monitor or stop the concessional cap per year?\nNo, Team Members have no limit on the concessional salary sacrifice. If the contribution goes beyond the annual limit, it will be taxed at a higher rate. The Employer portion, however, stops once it reaches the quarterly cap.\nLife insurance\nGitLab does not plan to offer life insurance at this time as Australians can access\ngovernment payments and services\nif they get ill, injured or have a disability. Most Australians who choose to have life insurance take out cover from their super fund.\nWorkers’ Compensation\nFair Work statement\nGitLab renews the Workers’ Compensation premium annually for each state.

For more details on the on-call procedure, please reference the\non-call page\n. The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of\ntime in lieu that will be offered for the Development and Infrastructure departments effective February 1, 2021.\nWe will continue to review and implement to other departments within Engineering iteratively.\nWith our global team, we strive for a “follow the sun” model for on-call rotation. This way, team members can participate in on-call during their daytime rather than their nighttime in their respective regions (APAC, EMEA and AMER). In APAC, the majority of the team members are located in Australia. We want to ensure engineers in Australia are 1) eligible for on-call shifts, and 2) stay aligned with local laws to ensure proper rest/recovery time after on-call shifts.\nEngineers based in Australia who are part of the Development and Infrastructure departments will be eligible for time in lieu after on-call shifts. Time in lieu is time off from work that is granted to team members to work outside of standard working hours (I.E. ordinary hours).\nHow much time in lieu will I receive for volunteering for on-call shifts?\n4-hour shift = ½ day time in lieu\n8-hour shift = 1 day time in lieu\n24-hour shift = 3 days time in lieu\nFor weekend shifts please be particularly mindful about managing your time to\nensure you are not exceeding a 38 hour work-week\n, and feel free to leverage our\nflexible PTO policy\nto complement time in lieu.\nNote: The full shift (state of readiness) is compensated by time in lieu - rather than only the “actual time worked”\nWhat should I do when I want to take more time off after an on-call shift?\nIf you need additional time to ensure a good work/life balance, on top of the time in lieu, you can leverage our Flexible\nPTO policy as described here\n.\nWhen can time in lieu be taken?\nTime in lieu should be taken\nwithin 2 weeks after completion of the on-call shift\n. We want to ensure that time in lieu is taken close to the on-call shift to ensure that team members have sufficient time to rest.\nDo all on-call shifts result in time in lieu?\nNo, only on-call shifts outside of working hours (I.E. weekends, evenings, etc.).\nPlease note that not all teams require weekend or evening on-call shifts, so this may not be applicable for all.\nHow do I request time in lieu?\nTime in lieu should be requested via Workday by selecting the\nTime Off in Lieu\nunder the\nTime Offs\ndropdown menu option.\nGitLab PTY Australia Annual, Sick and Carer’s Leave, and Other Statutory Leaves\nAnnual Leave\nFull-time team members are entitled to 4 weeks paid annual leave in accordance with the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) per year of continuous service.

Technological advancements, global events, and work demands can sometimes make us forget that we need a break to recharge.\nTeam members are expected to disconnect from work and work-related communications outside of normal working hours and during PTO and there are many suggestions in the Handbook for\ncommunicating when you will be away\nso other people can manage their time efficiently, projects don’t slip through the cracks, and so that team members are not disturbed while away.\nThis guidance reminds team members in Australia of their workplace right to disconnect (codified from 26 August 2024) and how the Company is committed to supporting team members in doing so.\nThe right to disconnect means that a team member is not required, outside of their working hours, to monitor, read or respond to contact, or attempted contact, from an employer or a third party (where the contact relates to their work), unless it would be unreasonable to refuse.\nIn addition to the suggestions for communicating when you will be away, take a look at these tips to increase a team member’s ability to disconnect from work:\nunsubscribe from any MRs that will likely resolve while you’re away, and then you won’t have to deal with all the emails from them when you return;\nset up some email filters to move emails into buckets that you can address one-at-a-time when you return;\ndisconnect yourself from Slack and Gmail in any of these ways (*note: Workday is supposed to turn off Slack notifications on your phone and set DND mode):\nlog out from Slack and Gmail on your phone, or\nremove Slack and Gmail from your phone, or\npause the Slack and Gmail apps on your phone, or\nmanually configure Slack and Gmail not to send notifications on your phone\nAt GitLab, team members should communicate respectfully and professionally at all times, in line with the Company’s values, with a bias towards asynchronous communication and documentation-first and should\nassume positive intent in dealings with others\n(including in relation to the tone and timing of communications).\nIn considering whether contact is unreasonable, think about:\nthe reason for contact;\nhow contact might be made and the level of disruption contact may cause;\nthe extent to which the team member is being compensated (eg with time off after an on-call rotation):\nto remain available to perform work during the period in which contact is made; or\nfor working additional hours outside of their ordinary hours of work;\nthe nature of the team member’s role and their level of responsibility; and\nthe team member’s personal circumstances.\nIn case of an issue arising relating to whether a team member has reasonably (or unreasonably) refused to monitor or respond to contact, the team members involved are encouraged to raise the issue with their manager or contact\nTeam Member Relations\n.\nThe FWC will update all modern awards to incorporate the right to disconnect in due course and awards can be checked\nhere\n.\nGitLab PTY New Zealand Specific Benefits\nMedical\nEffective 2024-02-01, GitLab offers Eligible New Zealand Team members a comprehensive medical plan\n“Well Being Two”\nvia Southern Cross.\nGitLab covers 100% of the Team Member costs for the plan.

Team members must select the\nPaid Time Off\noption in Workday when taking vacation time to ensure that annual leave entitlement is properly tracked.\nOn-Call (Engineering-only)\nNew Zealand employment law requires that work on a formal\nPublic Holiday\n, including\non-call\n, is compensated with time-in-lieu. Overtime pay is also required in certain situations, for example: whether the on-call shift fell on a “normal” working day or not, and whether the team member was called to work during their on-call shift. The policy linked above covers for the\ntime-in-lieu requirement\nbut we do not yet have a set mechanism for handling overtime pay requirements.\nNew Zealand-based team members\nmay not be on-call on a New Zealand Public Holiday\n, and must seek/find a replacement for any shifts where they may be indicated as being on call on a Public Holiday. To ensure we remain compliant with local laws we team members to consider local laws when volunteering for/accepting shifts.\nThe process is as follows:\nWhen scheduling we should avoid on-call taking/assigning on-call shifts on Public Holidays. A “Public Holiday” will be deemed as any day included in the official holidays on\nthis website\n.\nIf a team member is assigned for an on-call shift that falls on a Public Holiday, they need to align with their manager and try to find a replacement for that shift.\nIf it’s impossible to find a replacement and the team member ends up taking the on-call shift on a Public Holiday, the process to follow is:\nTeam member should obtain manager approval for taking the shift.\nIf the team member is not called in to work during their on-call shift, a regular time-in-lieu compensation for the shift should be applied.\nIf the team member is called in to work during their on call shift, they are responsible for recording their hours worked during the shift and report to payroll/manager in order for overtime payment processing.\nNote: To stay in compliance with local laws we would follow\nthe New Zealand government website\nwith regards to compensation for worked time during on-call.\nStatutory Sick Leave\nTeam members in New Zealand are entitled to 10 days’ of statutory sick leave after six months of current continuous employment with GitLab. For each 12 months after meeting the above criteria, each team member gets at least ten days sick leave.\nIf in any year the team member doesn’t meet the criteria, then they don’t get any new sick leave entitlement, but can use their sick leave balance which may have carried over. An employee may re-qualify for sick leave as soon as they meet the criteria.  The maximum amount of sick leave that can be accumulated under the Holidays Act 2003 is 20 days.\nSick Leave runs concurrently with GitLab’s\nSick Time Policy\n.\nHow to Apply:\nTeam members must contact\nleaves@gitlab.com\nwhen reporting their leave.\nIn accordance with the Holidays Act, GitLab may require a medical certificate\nDesignate any time off for illness as\nOut Sick\nin Workday to ensure that sick leave entitlement is properly tracked.\nUnused sick leave will not be paid out to the team member upon termination of employment.\nInjured Leave\nWhen the team member is taking leave for the first week of a non-work accident, they can use sick leave and/or annual leave if they have any.
