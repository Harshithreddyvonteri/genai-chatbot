GitLab’s E2E Pipeline Triage processes\nOverview\nThese guidelines gives GitLab team members on pipeline triage an idea on the priorities and processes that come with this responsibility. This builds from the information provided in\nOn-Call Rotation\n.\nThis guide is an extension of the\nBroken\nmaster\nengineering workflow and is intended to provide a more specific guide on how to triage end-to-end test pipeline failures. As a\nfirst step to identifying and resolving a broken master incident, please follow the steps in the broken master process.\nThe Pipeline triage\nDRI\nis responsible for analyzing and debugging test pipeline failures. Please refer to the\nDRI weekly rotation schedule\nto know who the current DRIs are.\nNOTE:\nFor information regarding debugging test pipeline failures, check out\nDebugging Failing E2E Tests and Test Pipelines\nGeneral guidelines\nFix tests failing in\nmaster\nbefore other development work\n:\nFailing tests on\nmaster\nare treated as the highest priority\nrelative to other development work, e.g., new features. Note that for pipeline triage DRIs,\ntriage and reporting\ntakes priority over fixing tests.\nFollow the\npipeline triage guidelines\nfor investigating, reporting, and resolving test failures\nFlaky tests are quarantined until proven stable\n: A flaky test is as bad as no tests or in some cases worse due to the effort required to fix or even re-write the test. As soon as it is detected, it is quarantined immediately to stabilize CI, fixed as soon as possible, and monitored until it is fixed.\nClose test failure issue (e.g example\nissue\n) when the test is moved out of quarantine\n: Quarantine issues should not be closed unless tests are moved out of quarantine.\nQuarantine issues should be assigned and scheduled\n: To ensure that someone is owning the issue, it should be assigned with a milestone set and have appropriate\n~\"quarantine\"\n, quarantine with type (e.g.\n~\"quarantine::bug\"\n) and failure with type (e.g.\n~\"failure::bug\"\n) labels.\nMake relevant stage group aware\n: When a test fails no matter the reason, an issue with related product group label (e.g.\n~\"group::ide\"\n) should be created and made known to the relevant product stage group as soon as possible.\nIn addition to notifying that a test in their domain fails, enlist help from the group as necessary.\nFailure due to bug\n: If one or multiple test failure(s) is a result of a bug, create a bug issue and provide as much details as possible (e.g. using issue’s Bug template, provide steps to reproduce, relevant screenshots, etc.). Link the\nall\nrelated test failure issues to the bug issue. Apply\n~\"type::bug\"\n, severity, priority, product group, feature category, etc. labels to ensure a fix is scheduled in a timely manner.\nTest failure issues are used for tracking and investigating purposes, they should not have\n~\"type::bug\"\nlabel. If the test failure is a result of a bug, apply\n~\"failure::bug\"\nlabel instead.\nEveryone can fix a test, the responsibility falls on the last who worked on it\n: Anyone can fix a failing/flaky test, but to ensure that a quarantined test isn’t ignored,\nthe last engineer who worked on the test is responsible for taking it out of\nquarantine\n.\nTriage flow\nThe flow of triaging the pipelines as a decision tree (nodes link to the relevant sections of the handbook)\nflowchart TB\n%% nodes\nslack_channels{check slack channel}\nnext_channel(move to next slack channel)\nfailed_pipeline(identify failure)\nexisting_issue{issue already reported?}\nnew_issue(create issue if does not already exist)\ntag_pipeline(notate issue in comment on pipeline run)\nincident{incident worthy?}\nnotify_incident(Notify about escallation)\nopen_incident(Open incident)\nupdate_incident(Update teams about incident)\neyes(tag pipeline run with :eyes: emoji)\nfire_engine(replace :eyes: with :fire_engine: emoji)\nboom(replace :eyes: with :boom: emoji)\nanother_failure{more failures?}\ninvestigate(investigate root cause for found failures)\nfix_tests(fix tests if possible)\nquarantine_tests(quarantine tests if necessary)\nmonitor_incident(participate in incident process)\ntag_issue_for_report(add your emoji to issue for the DRI gem)\npublish_results(publish your results to the triage issue with the DRI gem)\ndri_handoff(handoff to next DRI anything that is still in flight)\n%% external links\nclick failed_pipeline \"#review-the-failure-logs\"\nclick new_issue \"#create-an-issue\"\nclick existing_issue \"#known-failures\"\nclick investigate \"#investigate-the-root-cause\"\nclick incident \"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#report-an-incident-via-slack\"\nclick notify_groups \"#notify-group-in-all-cases\"\nclick fix_tests \"#fixing-the-test\"\nclick quarantine_tests \"#quarantining-tests\"\nclick open_incident \"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#failure-needs-escalation\"\nclick tag_pipeline \"#linking-issue\"\nclick eyes \"#emoji-used\"\nclick fire_engine \"#emoji-used\"\nclick boom \"#emoji-used\"\nclick tag_issue_for_report \"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/dri#configuration\"\nclick publish_results \"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/dri#4-publish\"\nclick notify_incident \"#failure-needs-escalation\"\nclick update_incident \"#notify-group-in-all-cases\"\n%% diagram\nslack_channels -->|failed pipeline run| eyes\nslack_channels -->|no failed pipeline runs| next_channel\nopen_incident --> next_channel\nanother_failure -->|no| next_channel\nincident -->|yes| notify_incident\nnext_channel --> investigate\nnext_channel --> publish_results\nsubgraph report the failure\neyes --> failed_pipeline\nfailed_pipeline --> existing_issue\nexisting_issue -->|new failure| new_issue\nexisting_issue -->|existing issue| fire_engine\nnew_issue --> boom\nboom --> notify_groups\nnotify_groups --> incident\nincident -->|no| tag_issue_for_report\ntag_issue_for_report --> tag_pipeline\nfire_engine --> tag_issue_for_report\ntag_pipeline --> another_failure\nanother_failure -->|yes| failed_pipeline\nend\nsubgraph escallate issue\nnotify_incident --> open_incident\nopen_incident --> update_incident\nupdate_incident --> monitor_incident\nend\nsubgraph follow up on test failures\ninvestigate --> fix_tests\ninvestigate --> quarantine_tests\nend\nsubgraph end of your day\npublish_results --> dri_handoff\nend\nHow to triage a QA test pipeline failure\nThe general triage steps are:\nReport the failure\nReview the failure logs\nInvestigate the root cause\nClassify and triage the test failure\nNotify relevant groups about the failure\nAfter triaging failed tests, possible follow up actions are:\nFixing tests\nQuarantining tests\nDequarantining tests\nRe-evaluating tests\nReport the failure\nYour priority is to make sure we have an issue for each failure, and to communicate the status of its investigation and resolution. When there are multiple failures to report, consider their impact when deciding which to report first. See the\npipeline triage responsibilities\nfor further guidance.\nIf there are multiple failures we recommend that you identify whether each one is new or old (and therefore already has an issue open for it). For each new failure, open an issue that includes only the required information. Once you have opened an issue for each new failure you can investigate each more thoroughly and act on them appropriately, as described in later sections.\nThe reason for reporting all new failures first is to allow faster discovery by engineers who might find the test failing in their own merge request test pipeline. If there is no open issue about that failure, the engineer will have to spend time trying to figure out if their changes caused it.\nKnown failures should be linked to the current\npipeline triage report\n. However, issues can be opened by anyone and are not linked automatically, so be sure to confirm there is no existing issue before creating one.\nSearch for existing issues that have already been created with the\nfailure::*\nlabel. By order of likelihood:\nfailure::investigating\nfailure::test-environment\nfailure::broken-test\nfailure::flaky-test\nfailure::stale-test\nfailure::bug\nfailure::external-dependency\nIf the issue has already been reported please use the existing issue to track the latest status.\nIf there is no existing issue for the failure, please\ncreate an issue\nusing one of\nclassification labels\nvia the steps below.\nIn the relevant Slack channel:\nApply the 👀 emoji to indicate that you’re investigating the failure(s).\nIf there’s a system failure (e.g., Docker or runner failure), retry the job and apply the :retry: emoji. Read below for examples of system failures.\nIf an issue exists, add a 🚒 emoji. It can be helpful to reply to the failure notification with a link to the issue(s), but this isn’t always necessary, especially if the failures are the same as in the previous pipeline and there are links there.\nIf it is a new failure issue, add a 💥 emoji.\nCheckout the list of\nSlack channels\nfor the pipeline-related channels.\nCreate an issue\nPlease use this step if there are no issues created to capture the failure. If there is already an issue please skip this step.\nCreate an issue for the test or system failure (if retrying the job does not resolve the latter) in\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues\nusing the\nQA failure\ntemplate. For failures in CustomersDot tests, open an issue in\nCustomersDot\nproject.\nApply the\n~\"type::ignore\"\nlabel to the issue until the investigation is complete and an\nissue type\nis determined.\nInform the counterpart SET about the failure.\nFor system failures, it may make sense to open an issue in a different project such as\nOmnibus GitLab\n,\nGitLab QA\n, or\nGitLab Runner\n.\nFor staging environment-related failures, you can post a question in\n#infrastructure-lounge\n, or open an issue in the\ninfrastructure project\nAsk for help in\n#s_developer_experience\nif you’re unsure where to file the issue.\nIn the relevant Slack channel, add the 💥 emoji and reply to the failure notification with a link to the issue.\nAdd the issue as a related issue to the current pipeline triage report. If multiple issues are the result of 1 bug, add the bug issue to the report instead.\nReview the failure logs\nThe aim of this step is to understand the failure. The results of the investigation will also let you know what to do about the failure. Update the failure issue with any findings from your review. For more information about the failure logs, check out\nDebugging Failing Tests and Test Pipelines\nInvestigate the root cause\nDepending on your level of context for the test and its associated setup, you might feel comfortable investigating the root cause on your own, or you might get help from other SETs right away.\nWhen investigating on your own, we suggest spending at most 20-30 minutes actively trying to find the root cause (this excludes time spent reporting the failure, reviewing the failure logs, or any test setup and pipeline execution time). After that point, or whenever you feel out of ideas, we recommend asking for help to unblock you.\nNote:\nPlease avoid logging in via\ngitlab-qa\nand all the other bot accounts on Canary/Production. They are monitored by\nSIRT\nand will raise an alert if someone uses them to log in. If it is really needed to log in with these accounts, please give a quick heads-up in\n#security-division\nthat someone is logging into the bot and tag\n@sirt-members\nfor awareness.\nBelow is the list of the common root causes in descending order of likelihood:\nCode changes: Check if the new code was deployed to the environment.\nFind the diff between current and previous GitLab versions using this example\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/-/compare/start_commit_sha...end_commit_sha\nto see if there was a change that could have affected the test.\nFeature Flag: Check if a new feature flag is enabled in the environment.\nWhen a feature flag is enabled, it’s being reported to specific QA pipeline Slack channel. This also triggers a Full QA job and it may help to identify which specific feature flag caused the failure.\nA list of logs containing details on both recent and historic feature flag changes can also be viewed by visiting the\nfeature-flag-log\nproject. Each time a feature flag is updated, a new issue is generated in the project with helpful information such as when the feature flag was changed, who performed the update and on which environment. The project contains several\nhost\nlabels that can help filter by environment when searching through issues (ex:\n~host::staging.gitlab.com\n)\nYou can also reference this\ndashboard\nfor a visual representation of feature flag statuses.\nEnvironment / Infrastructure: If there were no code or feature flag changes and the environment has flaky errors, first start with analyzing\nSentry errors and Kibana logs\nto further investigate the issue.\nReview the\n#incidents-dotcom\nchannel to check if any ongoing incidents may be contributing to the failures.\nIf\nvalidate_canary!\ncheck\nis failing, check if\ncanary is not disabled on the environment\nby running\n/chatops run canary --production\non\n#production\nor\n/chatops run canary --staging\non\n#staging\nSlack channels. If canary is enabled, each server should report a few connections\nUP\n.\nThere is\nknown intermittent issue\nwith the traffic not getting directed to canary even though the\ngitlab_canary=true\ncookie is set.\nGitLab’s\nTamland\nmay also be a helpful resource to review. Tamland is used to help forecast the utilization and saturation of various services, such as Sidekiq. For example, if high saturation is predicted, this could surface as flaky behavior in our tests due to performance degradation from that service. More information about Tamland can be found\nhere\n.\nYou may also reach out to the Infrastructure team at\n#infrastructure-lounge\nand ask if something was changed recently on the environment in question.\nTest Data: Check that test data is valid. Live environments like Staging and Production rely on pre-existing data (QA users, access tokens).\nNew GitLab QA version: Check if a new\nGitLab QA version\nwas released.\nFailure examples can be seen in\nTraining Videos\n.\nClassify and triage the test failure\nThe aim of this step is to categorize the failure as either a stale test, a bug in the test, a bug in the application code, or a flaky test.\nWe use the following labels to capture the cause of the failure.\n~\"failure::investigating\"\n: Default label to apply at the start of investigation.\n~\"failure::stale-test\"\n:\nStale test due to application change\n~\"failure::broken-test\"\n:\nBug in the test\n~\"failure::flaky-test\"\n:\nFlaky test\n~\"failure::test-environment\"\n:\nFailure due to test environment\n~\"failure::bug\"\n:\nBug in the application\n~\"failure::external-dependency\"\n:\nFailure due to an external dependency\nBugs blocking end-to-end test execution (due to the resulting quarantined tests) should additionally have severity and priority labels. For guidelines about which to choose, please see the\nblocked tests section of the issue triage page\n.\nNote\n: It might take a while for a fix to propagate to all environments. Be aware that a new failure could be related\nto a recently-merged fix that hasn’t made it to the relevant environment yet. Similarly, if a known failure occurs but\nthe test should pass because a fix has been merged, verify that the fix has been deployed to the relevant environment\nbefore attempting to troubleshoot further.\nStale test due to application change\nThe failure was caused by a change in the application code and the test needs to be updated.\nInclude your findings in a note in the issue about the failure.\nApply the\n~\"failure::stale-test\"\nlabel.\nIf possible, mention the merge request which caused the test to break, to keep the corresponding engineer informed.\nSee\nQuarantining Tests\nBug in the test\nThe failure was caused by a bug in the test code itself, not in the application code.\nInclude your findings in a note in the issue about the failure.\nApply the\n~\"failure::broken-test\"\nlabel.\nSee\nQuarantining Tests\nBug in the application\nThe failure was caused by a bug in the application code.\nApply\n~\"failure::bug\"\nlabel to the test failure issue(s).\nCreate a new issue link all related test failure issue(s) to this issue.\nInclude your findings in a note in the bug issue about the failure.\nAdd the steps to reproduce the bug and expected/actual behavior.\nApply the\n~\"type::bug\"\nlabel, and cc-ing the corresponding Engineering Managers (EM), QEM, and SET.\nApply the\n~\"found by e2e test\"\nlabel to the bug issue (or bug fix MR if it is fixed immediately) to indicate the bug was found by the end-to-end test execution.\nIf the problem adheres to the definition of a\ntransient bug\n, apply the ~“bug::transient” label as well.\nIf there is an issue open already for the bug, use this issue instead and apply the above steps.\nCommunicate the issue in the corresponding Slack channels.\nQuarantine\nthe test right after the bug issue has been created. Leave a note on the bug issue with the link to the quarantined test and mention that it should be un-quarantined with the fix.\nWhen the reason for quarantining a test is because of a low severity bug in the code which will not be fixed in the upcoming couple of releases, add the\n~\"quarantine\"\n, quarantine with type and\n~\"failure::bug\"\nlabels to the test failure issue(s).\nWhen the bug is fixed, the related quarantined tests should be unquarantined and verified as well. The bug issue and all related test failure issues should be closed out together.\nNote\n: GitLab maintains a\ndaily deployment cadence\nso a breaking change in\nmaster\nreaches Canary and Production fast. Please communicate broadly to ensure that the corresponding\nProduct Group\nis aware of the regression and action is required. If the bug is\nqualified for dev escalation\n(example:\npriority::1/severity::1\nissue that blocks the deployment process), consider involving\nOn-call Engineers\nin the\n#dev-escalation\nchannel. To find out who’s on-call follow the links in the channel subject line.\nTo find the appropriate team member to cc, please refer to the\nOrganizational Chart\n.\nSee\nQuarantining Tests\nFlaky Test\nRead more\n:\nWhat is a flaky test?\nWhat are the potential causes for a test to be flaky?\nProcess\nInclude your findings in a note in the failure issue.\nApply the\n~\"failure::flaky-test\"\nlabel to the failure issue.\nApply a\n~\"flaky-test::*\"\nscoped label\nto the failure issue.\nFlakiness can be caused by a myriad of problems. Examples of underlying problems\nthat have caused us flakiness include:\nNot waiting appropriately for pages to load or transitions from one state to another to complete.\nAnimations preventing tests from interacting with elements.\nNon-independent tests (i.e. test A passes when run first, but fails otherwise).\nActions not completing successfully (e.g. logging out).\nFor more details, see the list with example issues in our\nunhealthy tests\ndocumentation.\nSee\nQuarantining Tests\nFailure due to test environment\nThe failure is due external factors outside the scope of the test but within a test environment under GitLab’s control. This could be due to environments, deployment hang-ups, or upstream dependencies within GitLab’s control.\nInclude your findings in a note in the issue about the failure.\nApply the\n~\"failure::test-environment\"\nlabel.\nIdentify the general category of improvement and add the failure issue to the approprite\nTest Reliability\nissue listed within the\nImprove test environment reliability and reduce flaky/transient test failures\ntracking issue.\nA job may fail due to infrastructure or orchestration issues that are not related to any specific test. In some cases these issues will fail a job before tests are ever executed. Some examples of non-test related failures include:\nFailed to download container from GitLab Container Registry\nFailed to complete orchestration of a Geo cluster\nCI runner timeouts\n500 error while uploading job artifacts\nExpired tokens (For more information, check out how to\nRotate Credentials\n)\nFailure due to external dependency\nThe failure is due to an external dependency the test is reliant on, but is outside of GitLab’s control. This could be due to outages in external package management systems, or outages in third-party integrations. If possible, external dependencies should be avoided to increase the reliability of the test suite.\nInclude your findings in a note in the issue about the failure.\nApply the\n~\"failure::external-dependency\"\nlabel.\nInclude a link to the external dependency’s outage notice, if available.\nSome examples of external dependency failures could include:\nOutages in package or container management systems such as registry.npmjs.org, RubyGems.org, NuGet or dockerhub\nOutages in third-party integrations such as Zuora\nNotify relevant groups about the failure\nFailure needs escalation\nIf the failure is in a\nsmoke\ntest, it will block deployments. Please inform the release managers of the root cause and if a fix is in progress by Quality. On GitLab.com, you can use\n@gitlab-org/release/managers\n. In Slack, you can use\n@release-managers\n.\nIf the failure could affect the performance of\nGitLab.com\nproduction, or make it unavailable to a specific group of users, you can\ndeclare an incident\nwith\n/incident declare\nin the\n#production\nSlack channel, this will automatically prevent deployments (if the incident is at least an S2).\nNotify group in all cases\nPlease also raise awareness by looping in the appropriate team members from the product group, such as SET or EM. The SET/EM can be identified by looking for who is assigned to that\nstage/group\n. Many tests are tagged with a\nproduct_group\nwhich will help with identification. You may also want to post in Quality’s Slack channel\n#quality\ndepending on the impact of the failure.\nFollowing up on test failures\nFixing the test\nIf you’ve found that the test is the cause of the failure (either because the application code was changed or there’s a bug in the test itself), it will need to be fixed. This might be done by another SET or by yourself. However, it should be fixed as soon as possible. In any case, the steps to follow are as follows:\nCreate a merge request (MR) with the fix for the test failure.\nApply the ~“Pick into auto-deploy”, ~“priority::1”, and ~“severity::1” labels if the fix is urgent and required to unblock deployments.\nIf the test was flaky:\nConfirm that the test is stable by ensuring it passes 3 to 5 times while in quarantine.\nNote\nThe number of passes needed to be sure a test is stable is just a suggestion.\nYou can use your judgement to pick a different threshold.\nIf the test was in quarantine,\nremove it from quarantine\n.\nQuarantining Tests\nThe aim of quarantining a test is not to get back a green pipeline, but rather to reduce the noise (due to constantly failing tests, flaky tests, and so on) so that new failures are not missed. If you’re unsure about quarantining a test ask for help in the\n#quality\nSlack channel, and then consider adding to the list of examples below to help future pipeline triage DRIs.\nExamples of when to quarantine a test:\nBug in test code (\n~\"failure::broken-test\"\n), and a fix won’t be ready for review within 24 hours\nStale test (\n~\"failure::stale-test\"\n), and a fix won’t be ready for review within 24 hours\nExamples of when not to quarantine a test:\nTest failure is environment-related (\n~\"failure::test-environment\"\n), and neither the application code nor test code are the cause of the failure\nA merge request to fix the failure will be ready for review within 24 hours\nA flaky smoke test.\nThe\n:smoke\ntag should be removed from the test to prevent it running with the\nsmoke\nsuite, but still allowed to run elsewhere while the flakiness is under investigation or being worked on to unblock deployment.\nCreate an issue to follow up and restore the\n:smoke\ntag as soon as possible. Tests at the\n:smoke\nlevel should be given priority when addressing flakiness within our test suites.\nCreate a\n# TODO\nnote in the test as a reminder with a link to the previously created issue url. For example:\n# TODO restore :smoke tag and close https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/######\nNote\nThe time limit for the fix is just a suggestion.\nYou can use your judgement to pick a different threshold.\nFast quarantine\nIf a test is failing and you have good reason to quarantine it quickly you can\nfast quarantine\nit. Fast quarantine can be done by a single person, without requiring review by another engineer.\nYou should use fast quarantine to unblock deployment pipelines and MRs if the failure is disruptive and you’ve ruled out bugs as the cause of the failure (e.g., you’ve identified that the test is stale, or flaky).\nNote\n: Failing\ngdk-instance\njob in the\ne2e: test-on-gdk\nchild pipeline will block MR pipelines as well as scheduled master pipelines. Failures of those tests are good candidates for fast quarantine.\nAfter fast quarantining, please follow the long-term quarantine process below.\nLong-term quarantine\nAdd the\n:quarantine\nmetadata to the test with a link to the issue (see\nquarantined test types\n)\nNote\nIf the example has a\nbefore\nhook,\nthe\nquarantine\nmetadata should be assigned to the outer context\nto avoid running the\nbefore\nhook.\nCreate a merge request using the\nQuarantine end-to-end Test\ntemplate.\nThe merge request shall have the labels:\n~\"Quality\", ~\"QA\", ~\"type::bug\"\n.\nThe merge request may have auto-deploy labels:\n~\"Pick into auto-deploy\", ~\"priority::1\", and ~\"severity::1\"\n. Please note that this is reserved for emergency cases only, such as blocked deployments, as it will delay all other deployments by around two hours.\nThe merge request may have stage or group labels. E.g.\n~\"devops::create\" ~\"group::source code\"\n.\nThe merge request shall have the current milestone.\nThe merge request shall link to (but not close) the failure issue.\nThe failure issue should remain open and be assigned a DRI for fixing, re-evaluating, or dequarantining the test as needed.\nTo be sure that the test is quarantined quickly, ask in the\n#quality\nSlack channel for someone to review and merge the merge request, rather than assigning it directly.\nHere is an\nexample quarantine merge request\n.\nNote\nBe aware that for blocked release cycle auto deploy with quarantined test will not work. During canary deployment we trigger tests against both staging and canary. Spec is not quarantined on staging yet because quarantined MR didn’t reach it. That leads to environment circular dependency problem.\nIn that case the Release Managers should decide whether it is possible to rollback Staging, or whether to\nmanually deploy the quarantined MR to Staging\n. Manually deploying the fix to Staging will reduce the amount of mixed-version testing but may be the only option to allow deployment pipelines to continue.\nQuarantined Test Types\nIf a test is placed under quarantine, it is important to specify\nwhy\n. By specifying a quarantine type we can see\nquickly the reason for the quarantine.\nBelow is a list of quarantine types you may use, and their purpose. If the reason for quarantine is not listed\nbelow, please consider contributing to this list:\nQuarantine Type\nDescription\n:flaky\nThis test fails intermittently\n:bug\nThis test is failing due to a bug in the application\n:stale\nThis test is outdated due to a feature change in the application and must be updated to fit the new changes\n:broken\nThis test is failing because of a change to the test code or framework\n:waiting_on\nThis test is quarantined temporarily due to an issue or MR that is a prerequisite for this test to pass\n:investigating\nThis test is a\n:flaky\ntest but it might be blocking other MRs and so should be quarantined while it’s under investigation\n:test_environment\nThis test is failing due to problems with the test environment and will not be fixed within 24 hours\n:dependency\nThis test is failing due to an external dependency the test is reliant on, but is outside of GitLab’s control\nNote\n: Be sure to attach an\nissue\nto the quarantine metadata. We use this issue for tracking the average age of the quarantined tests.\nExamples\nit\n'is flaky'\n,\nquarantine\n:\n{\nissue\n:\n'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12345'\n,\ntype\n:\n:flaky\n}\nit\n'is due to a bug'\n,\nquarantine\n:\n{\nissue\n:\n'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12345'\n,\ntype\n:\n:bug\n}\ncontext\n'when these tests rely on another MR'\n,\nquarantine\n:\n{\ntype\n:\n:waiting_on\n,\nissue\n:\n'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/12345'\n}\nNested contexts\nYou should apply the quarantine tag to the outermost\ndescribe\n/\ncontext\nblock that has tags relevant\nto the test being quarantined.\n## Good\nRSpec\n.\ndescribe\n'Plan'\n,\n:smoke\n,\nquarantine\n:\n{\nissue\n:\n'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12345'\n,\ntype\n:\n:flaky\n}\ndo\ndescribe\n'Feature'\ndo\nbefore\n(\n:context\n)\ndo\n# This before(:context) block will only be executed in smoke quarantine jobs\nend\nend\nend\n## Bad\nRSpec\n.\ndescribe\n'Plan'\n,\n:smoke\ndo\ndescribe\n'Feature'\n,\nquarantine\n:\n{\nissue\n:\n'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/12345'\n,\ntype\n:\n:flaky\n}\ndo\nbefore\n(\n:context\n)\ndo\n# This before(:context) block could be mistakenly executed in quarantine jobs that _don't_ have the smoke tag\nend\nend\nend\nDequarantining Tests\nFailing to dequarantine tests periodically reduces the effectiveness of the test suite. Hence, the tests should be dequarantined on or before the due-date mentioned in the corresponding issue.\nBefore dequarantining a test:\nIf the test failure was originally discovered in\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nnightly schedule pipeline\n, MR or\nmaster\npipeline, please make sure that the test passes on your local against GDK with latest code and that it has passed a few times\nin the nightly pipeline’s quarantine job for that test.\nIf the test failure was originally discovered in\nstaging\n,\ncanary\nor\nproduction\npipeline, please make sure that the test passes in the CI pipeline against that environment.\nYou can trigger a CI pipeline against a live environment by clicking “Run Pipeline” button on the\nstaging\n,\ncanary\nor\nproduction\npipelines page\nand setting the\nRELEASE\nvariable to the release that has your changes. See\nRunning GitLab-QA pipeline against a specific GitLab release\nfor instruction on finding your release version created and tagged by the Omnibus pipeline.\nTo dequarantine a test:\nCreate a merge request that removes the\n:quarantine\ntag using the\nQuarantine End to End Test\nMR template.\nClose the issue created as part of the quarantining process.\nAs with quarantining a test, you can ask in the\n#quality\nSlack channel for someone to review and merge the merge request, rather than assigning it.\nRe-evaluating tests\nIf the due date of a failing test issue is reached, you should re-evaluate if the failing test should really be covered at the end-to-end test level, or if it should be covered in a lower level of the\ntesting levels pyramid\n.\nIf you decide to delete the test, open a merge request to delete it and close the test failure issue. In the MR description or comment, mention the stable counterpart SET for the test’s stage for their awareness. Then open a new issue to cover the test scenario in a different test level.\nIf you decide the test is still valuable but don’t want to leave it quarantined, you could replace\n:quarantine\nwith\n:skip\n, which will skip the test entirely (i.e., it won’t run even in jobs for quarantined tests). That can be useful when you know the test will continue to fail for some time (e.g., at least the next milestone or two).\nQuarantined test report\nEvery week, a list of the current\nlong-term quarantined\nE2E tests in both the GitLab and CustomersDot project is reported to the\n#quality-reports\nSlack channel.\nThis report is generated from the Test Platform Department’s\ntoolbox\nproject.\nTraining videos\nThese videos walking through the triage process were recorded and uploaded to the\nGitLab Unfiltered\nYouTube channel.\nQuality Team: Failure Triage Training - Part 1\nCovers the basics of investigating pipeline failures locally.\nQuality Team: Failure Triage Training - Part 2\nContinued discussion with a focus on using Docker containers that were used in the pipeline that failed.\nQuality Engineering On-call Rotation and Debugging QA failures\n(\nprivate video\non GitLab Unfiltered)\nOverview of QE on-call rotation process, GitLab deployment process and how to debug failed E2E specs with examples.\nQuality Engineering: Test environments show and tell\nA show and tell presentation that gives an overview of our test environments.
