<p>The <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security/">Sec Section</a> coordinates GitLab's overall direction for <a href="/solutions/supply-chain/">Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS)</a>.
Many groups are involved in delivering a comprehensive, quality secure supply chain experience at GitLab.</p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver capabilities in the GitLab platform that gives users confidence in the integrity and security of their software supply chain.
This direction page is intended to facilitate collaboration and describe the product capabilities that would contribute to this vision.</p>
<h2 id=background>Background</h2>
<p>In today's software-driven world, your applications aren't just what you code - they're built from hundreds of components from across the global software supply chain. While this accelerates innovation, it also introduces new risks. GitLab gives you visibility into these risks and provides ways to remediate them.</p>
<p>Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) seeks to manage the full spectrum of security risks that may be introduced by people, processes, or technology throughout planning, building, deploying, and operating an application, from concept to sunset. Recent high-profile attacks like SolarWinds have shown that compromised dependencies can have devastating consequences. Meanwhile, new regulations like the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity">US Executive Order on Cybersecurity</a> and <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act">EU Cyber Resilience Act</a> are making supply chain security a compliance requirement.</p>
<p>Shared understanding of SSCS's scope has evolved significantly over the past few years. What was once rooted rather narrowly in managing third-party dependency risk has evolved into a robust set of standards and approaches that address practices across the full spectrum of software development activities. A central concern of SSCS and its primary "output" is a software artifact's<sup id="fnref:1" role=doc-noteref><a href="#fn:1" class=footnote rel=footnote>1</a></sup> chain of custody. This chain of custody materializes in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A software bill of materials (SBoM) specifies what comprises a software artifact, including any third-party code, along with other facts about where it's coming from and how it was producedâanalogous to an "ingredient label" for the product.</li>
<li><a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels">Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts</a> (SLSA) specifies guidelines and appropriate types of evidence about other parts of the software production process. Continuing the SBOM-as-ingredient-list analogy, SLSA <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/about#slsa-in-laypersons-terms">is described</a> as "the food safety handling guidelines that make an ingredient list credible". SLSA is not a single standard, so organizations and products satisfy different tracks and levels of its guidelines.</li>
<li>NIST's <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf">Secure Software Development Framework</a> (SSDF) and accompanying practical guides from the Enduring Security Framework partnership (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DEVELOPERS.PDF">example</a>) outline a core set of high-level secure software development practices that can be integrated into any SDLC implementation. They categorize these practices into four groups: prepare the organization, protect the software, produce well-secured software, and respond to vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these concepts, documents, and standards are increasingly being embedded in industry requirements and regulations. Although the supply chain security space is still rapidly evolving, the U.S. Government has already begun implementing requirements for federal vendors. We expect that supply chain requirements will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future as part of federal regulations, regulated-industry standards, and individual organizational requirements.</p>
<p>As a single application for the DevSecOps lifecycle, GitLab is uniquely positioned to meet all of the requirements.</p>
<h2 id=how-sscs-applies-to-gitlab>How SSCS applies to GitLab</h2>
<p>SSCS applies to GitLab in more than one way:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a company building a product:
<ol>
<li>We produce software artifacts for customers, and these customers require us to make assertions about the quality and provenance of the artifacts we provide.</li>
<li>We consume software artifacts from other sources, including open-source software that we redistribute to our customers as part of our product.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>As a product enabling customers to build their own products:
<ol>
<li>We enable customers to securely produce and consume software.</li>
<li>We host software projects, and build and distribute software artifacts, making us a key part of the supply chain.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This direction focuses on the capabilities we provide to customers, so they can securely produce and consume software.</p>
<h2 id=current-position-and-vision>Current Position and Vision</h2>
<p>We believe that there are five main aspects to consider when providing for a secure end-to-end software supply chain.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Source</strong> - includes the controls needed to be confident that both internal and external source code is safe from vulnerabilities and has not been compromised in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Build</strong> - includes rigorous requirements for the security and isolation of build environments as well as the automatic generation of provenance.</li>
<li><strong>Consumption</strong> - includes the ability to validate authenticity and source of any executed binaries. Supports requirements for securing the underlying host infrastructure itself.</li>
<li><strong>Management Process</strong> - this component spans across all other aspects of SSCS and includes both the tools and processes necessary to provide for ongoing visibility into compliance SSCS requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Security</strong> - this component spans across all other aspects of SSCS and includes the adoption of best practices for managing the security of the underlying tools themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>The state of GitLab product capabilities required to address each of the five aspects of SSCS currently spans the spectrum from vision items to complete features:</p>
<h3 id=source>Source</h3>
<p>The approach for protecting code sources can be subdivided by thinking about protection for Internal Sources separately from protection for External Sources.</p>

<h2 id=strategy>Strategy</h2>
<p>In the long-term, our strategy is to become a complete provider for all aspects of software supply chain security. Providing all of these aspects within a single application not only supports GitLab's broader <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/source/handbook/product/single-application">Single Application Strategy</a> but also provides numerous tangible benefits for users.</p>
<p>Among other things, using a single application:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimizes the number of different tools that need to be hardened and monitored.</li>
<li>reduces the number of potential points of security failure as data is transferred between various tools.</li>
<li>enables seamless interoperability.</li>
<li>simplifies visibility and traceability for audits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=highlighted-epics-and-issues>Highlighted epics and issues</h2>
<p>There are a few epics and important issues you can check out to see where we're headed. More will be added here as we develop this vision further.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8226">Dependency Management Vision</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6207">Artifact Data Store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5135">Release Evidence Viability</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id=whats-next--why>What's next &amp; why</h2>
<p>Although we support <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/signing_examples.html">signing of build artifacts through Sigstore</a>, the user experience for signed container images in GitLab is not ideal as signatures show up on a separate line item from the container image that they have signed. In 16.11 we plan to address this by associating container images with their signatures in the UI to make it easier to see which images are signed and to more easily validate those signatures.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are continuing ongoing work to explore whether we can automatically sign build artifacts natively in the GitLab Runner. Automatic signing is believed to be the best way to get widespread adoption of signing.</p>
<p>A full list of the SSCS working group's current priorities can be viewed <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/working-groups/software-supply-chain-security/#priorities-and-progress">on this working group page</a>.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-we-not-doing>What are we not doing</h2>
<p>Sigstore currently has two key limitations that impact GitLab:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sigstore does not have a Ruby library</li>
<li>Sigstore does not have good support for deploying and running a self managed Sigstore instance</li>
</ol>
<p>We do not currently plan to address either of these limitations directly and instead are hoping to work with the wider community to find alternate solutions. Because of these feature gaps, we do not plan on adding support for our Sigstore integration for self managed instances. We also are limited in our ability to natively validate Sigstore signatures within GitLab due to the lack of Ruby support.</p>
<h2 id=competitive-landscape>Competitive landscape</h2>
<p>There have been indications that Tekton and Sigstore are tools representing a leader in software supply chain security. One example of how this has been used in practice can be found in this <a href="https://dlorenc.medium.com/zero-trust-supply-chain-security-e3fb8b6973b8">blog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#registry-support">CoSign</a> is an open source tool that can be used for container signing.</p>
<p><a href="https://grafeas.io/">Grafeas</a> is an open-source artifact metadata datastore tool which offers flexible, universal artifact metadata storage - a key foundation for software supply chain security.</p>
<h2 id=frameworks>Frameworks</h2>
<p><strong>Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://slsa.dev/">SLSA framework</a> is an open source specification that is primarily focused on preventing artifacts from being tampered with as they are coded, developed, and published. Our vision for SSCS includes adding native support for SLSA with the objective of eventually fully supporting all the way up to SLSA level 3. GitLab already supports users who want to attain SLSA L1. GitLab is currently exploring ways to natively generate the required provenance data for SLSA as part of its Runner that does the build. For more details on SLSA, view the <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements">SLSA requirements</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Update Framework (TUF)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md#the-update-framework-specification">The Update Framework (TUF)</a> is an open source specification for that provides instructions on how to organize, sign, and interact with metadata to secure package managers. Our vision for SSCS includes adding native support for TUF in the future by including the required metadata in the software provenance that we plan to generate and by validating signatures at each step of the software lifecycle. TUF leverages a Kritis store to manage metadata from in-toto. TUF recommends the use of an OCI image-spec container registry, aligned with our Container Registry's <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/container_registry_metadata_database/#new-features-and-breaking-changes">documentation</a>. Some gaps to consider for GitLab are the rotation of secrets and key management, which is a part of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/software_supply_chain_security/pipeline_security/secrets_management/">Secrets Management direction</a>.
TUF also recommends the <a href="/direction/delivery/deployment_management/">verification of deployments</a>.
