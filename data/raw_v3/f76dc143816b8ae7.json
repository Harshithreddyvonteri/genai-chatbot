We invest in\nquote-to-cash\nsystems to make purchasing, activating, and managing GitLab subscriptions as easy as possible. This improves customer satisfaction and streamlines our go-to-market (GTM) processes, helping accelerate revenue growth for the company. As GitLab expands its AI offerings and marketplace integrations, the Fulfillment team plays a vital role in enabling these new capabilities for customers while supporting the company's ambitious growth objectives.\nGroups\nThe Fulfillment team consists of five groups:\nFulfillment Platform\n- Provides the architecture and foundational systems that power all fulfillment systems and integrations.\nSubscription Management\n- Enables customers to purchase GitLab products, manage subscriptions, and handle billing through self-service tools.\nProvision\n- Facilitates subscription provisioning after purchase by creating licenses for self-managed instances and updating GitLab.com groups with entitlements.\nSeat Management\n- Handles user assignment of purchased seats and add-ons and provides visibility into seat usage across namespaces.\nUtilization\n- Helps customers view and manage usage for consumable products to optimize their GitLab investments.\nGet Involved\nWe welcome feedback and contributions to help improve our fulfillment processes:\nFor customers and community members: Share your experiences and suggestions through our\npublic issue tracker\nor by contacting your GitLab representative.\nFor everyone: Create a merge request to this page and assign it to\n@courtmeddaugh\nfor review, or\nopen a Fulfillment Meta issue\nwith your ideas.\nYour insights help us continually improve and align our efforts with user needs.\nMission\nEnable customer success through frictionless purchasing and subscription management experiences across the entire GitLab platform. Empower customers to easily acquire, provision, and optimize their GitLab investments through intuitive self-service experiences and flexible monetization models that scale with their needs.\nGitLab paid plans offer rich feature sets that enable customers to build software faster and more securely. For the Fulfillment section, success is to make it as easy as we can for a customer to transact with GitLab and unlock the value of these rich feature sets in our paid offerings.\nWe champion a \"self-service first\" approach while also supporting sales-assisted transactions. Our goal is to enable flexible monetization models including both seat-based subscriptions and usage-based add-ons. We're continuously working to simplify subscription management and support customers' preferred purchasing channels and payment methods. Given the diversity of customers we serve across various countries, organization sizes, and industries, we strive to excel at both direct transactions and sales through\nchannels and alliances\n.\nOperating Principles\nIn our team, we operate based off the below principles.\n1. Provide an Excellent Customer Experience\nDesign purchasing, management and provisioning experiences that are intuitive and self-service first\nEnsure consistent reliability and performance across all customer touchpoints\nSupport customer growth with clear upgrade paths and flexible subscription management options\nFocus on automation to reduce manual intervention and improve accuracy\n2.
