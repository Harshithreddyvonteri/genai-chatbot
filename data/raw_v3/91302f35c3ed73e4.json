It is a glue that spans across different stages and enables our customers to setup and adopt GitLab by providing a frictionless\nImport\nexperience to bring your applications into GitLab,\nIntegrations\nwith your ecosystem and an intuitive and effective\nNavigation\nsystem.\nGroups\nThe Foundations stage is made up of four groups. You can find the direction pages of these groups here:\nImport and Integrate\nPersonal productivity\nDesign System\nUX Paper Cuts\nThe existing team members for the Foundations Stage can be found under the links below:\nImport and Integrate\nPersonal productivity\nDesign System\nUX Paper Cuts\nStage Themes\nDrive Adoption\nAligning with\nCore Platform section\ntheme\n\"GitLab is easy to deploy and adopt\"\n, the foundations stage will aim to drive adoption of GitLab through a faster & smoother onboarding process. Our onboarding process will support our customers needs for lower downtime & improved reliability of importers. This will increase number of customers who onboard to GitLab as well as reduce the time it takes to onboard, increasing overall adoption of GitLab.\n`- We will prioritize enhancing the experience for enterprise customers by developing tools that improve business continuity, reduce downtime, provide easy-to-understand error messages, and ensure reliable data migration. For instance, \"Import Evaluation Tool\" can be run before the migration and will help customers understand how long will migration take, what can and cannot be migrated, and possibly even suggest \"migration waves\" to break down a huge import into several chunks. This feature in combination with faster import reduces the downtime and allows flexibility to work through migration in off-hours improving business continuity\nOur goal is to enhance collaboration and productivity by creating integrations that help customers get more out of their GitLab experience. For example, rather than manually updating Jira ticket status upon code merge, GitLab for\nJira integration\nautomates this process. This removes redundancy and saves up to 30 minutes per day of the development time per developer.\nCustomers will be able to customize & extend GitLab for their unique needs by using APIs and Webhooks. For instance, an internal process can be run by utilizing webhook that triggers the\nevent on pipeline status change\n.\nSecurity and Compliance\nTypically, an enterprise will have a security team, DevOps teams, and an internal compliance officer. They collectively try to understand how the product in the organization is being delivered and have manual processes to examine compliance. By automating some of these tasks, we can accelerate the time to delivery for our customers and reduce the cost of compliance. For instance, security standards & best practices defined at project, group or organization level could be applied automatically to detect if the code merged is compliant or not. Additional security measures could be applied to prevent the branch from being merged if a certain level of compliance is not met. This DevOps automation could be applied to organization-specific, industry-specific ( e.g.\nPCI-DSS\n), or government-related ( e.g.\nGDPR\n) regulations to increase operational efficiency and bake in security as part of the development lifecycle.\nHelp Customers Deliver Faster\nThe Foundations stage is uniquely positioned to minimize the time it takes for our customers to deliver throughout the DevSecOps life cycle. We will help our customers deliver faster by\nMaking it easier for everyone to contribute.\nFor instance, build modular & easy to plug-and-play infrastructure for âonboardingâ. This will accelerate process of maturing onboarding platform by increasing the number of 3rd party tools we can migrate from while improving maintainability. In the future, importing from Jenkins, GitHub Actions and Jira can be easily added by introducing field mapping from respective tools to GitLab. This will make it easier for community, partners & internal teams to contribute and help customers deliver faster.\nReducing the time taken to complete your day-to-day tasks in GitLab. Here are few use-cases:\nFor a system admin, Setting up approvers or changing Jira integration settings by improving the usability & accessibility of Settings.\nFor a product manager or developer, to access issues or MRs using Pinning.\nUsing AI to automate workflows. For instance, suggest fixes for vulnerability finds, build automated test cases to speed up the development process, execute those test cases async & even create issues and suggests fixes for bugs found.\nImprove SUS (System Usability Score)\nThis theme is directly aligned with\n\"World Class DevSecOps experience\"\n. The foundations stage spans across different stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle. Our goal is to improve the overall user experience by improving the usability & accessibility of GitLab with our continued efforts on\ndesign system adoption\n&\nnew and improved navigation\n. We will continue to make it easier for our users to find what they are looking for, to pick up where they left off, and to orient them in GitLab. For instance, If you're a System Admin who updates MR settings annually (such as merging only on a successful pipeline or with approval from 2+ reviewers), we aim to simplify the process. No need to recall previous actions or sift through notes.\n3 Year Strategy\nIn three years, we expect :\nOnboarding to Gitlab from other platforms (such as GitHub, Bitbucket) to SaaS/Dedicated will be predictable & 80% faster than in FY23.\nOnboarding journey will cover wider use-cases than importing groups & projects to support customers in getting the most out of their GitLab instance. For instance, importing Github Actions and Jira issues.\nTo integrate with third-party tools that are consistent with the\nvision of AllOps\nplatform, ensuring that they complement the DevSecOps journey and promote collaboration. Notably, tools such as Jira, Slack, and ServiceNow will be integrated in alignment with our overarching one-platform strategy.\nSystem administrators will have Enterprise User management tools for easy, secure, and automated user lifecycle management, minimizing the need for manual work. For instance, Automated off-boarding processes we introduce aim to reduce risk of unauthorized access, data loss and security exposures.\nTo improve learnability & reduce cognitive load on users through intuitive, easy-to-use, and accessible Navigation.\nArtificial Intelligence will increase automation and make it easier and faster for users to manage their DevSecOps tasks. For instance, a personal assistant for the devOps team that automates the test cases for the code, determines the test coverage and suggests ways to improve it.\n1 Year Plan\nImport and Integrate\nPersonal productivity\nThe Personal productivity team will continue to build cross-stage UIs and user workflows that should be consistent, clearly designed, and iterated on like a feature to improve the overall user experience of GitLab. In rest of the FY24 and FY25, we will work on\nEnhancing the navigation experience of the super sidebar.\nContinue to build consistent user experience across GitLab by increasing Pajamas adoption.\nEnable Dark Mode as color theme in New Navigation\nContinue to enhance the design system with the goal of improving overall SUS\nImprove usability of Settings\nBuild The Message Center for personalized notifications to the users.\nTarget audience\nGitLab identifies who our DevSecOps application is built for utilizing the following categorization. We list our view of who we will support when in priority order.\nð© - Targeted with strong support\nð¨ - Targeted but incomplete support\nâ¬ï¸ - Not targeted but might find value\nToday\nð©\nCompliance Managers\nð©\nSystems Administrator\nð¨\nApplication Ops\nð¨\nPlatform Engineer\nð©\nSoftware Developers\nð©\nDevelopment Team Leads\nð¨\nApplication Development Director\nâ¬ï¸\nProduct Managers\nâ¬ï¸\nSoftware Engineer in Test\nâ¬ï¸\nProduct Designers\nð¨\nDevOps Engineers\nð¨\nSecurity Operations Engineers\nð©\nSecurity Analysts\nð¨\nRelease Manager\nMetrics\nManage uses\nStage MAU\nas a primary measure of success.

We seek to be leaders at GitLab by:\nIterate on the essential\nLeading the way on iteration, regularly shooting for small but ambitious MVCs.\nSupporting iteration with a great planning and development process, giving us checkpoints to keep issues small and incremental. As a result, our throughput is high.\nValuing the 1-year themes above, and deliberately deciding to not pursue initiatives that donât support our 2020 goals. We'd rather do a few things well than a bunch of things poorly.\nPrioritizing depth over breadth. For the most part, weâre biased toward doubling down and investing on whatâs working rather than extending the breadth of our stage.\nMeasure what matters\nPrioritizing instrumentation through our North Star dashboards, which we regularly monitor to keep our priorities in check.\nMeasuring business value by tying customer delight and revenue to our priorities.\nGreat team\nAspiring to be the happiest team at GitLab, with high individual job satisfaction.\nHaving great work-life balance, ensuring that we\nvalue friends and family above work\nand avoid individual burnout.\nCategories\nImporters\nImport existing work into GitLab from a wide variety of sources.\nPriority: high â¢\nDocumentation\nâ¢\nDirection\nNotifications\nWeb and email notifications\nDocumentation\nâ¢\nDirection\nNavigation\nHow users move through the product\nDirection\nSettings\nSettings encompasses all configuration interfaces across GitLab that allow users to customize and manage their GitLab experience, including project settings, group settings, user profiles, admin configurations, and system-wide controls. Settings-related issues typically involve users having difficulty finding, accessing, or modifying configuration options, or experiencing problems with settings inheritance and permissions.\nDirection\nGitLab Documentation Site\nImprove and maintain the features, style, and build process for the GitLab Documentation website.\nPriority: medium â¢\nDocumentation\nâ¢\nDirection\nPajamas Design System\nGitLab's design system called Pajamas. Used internally to power GitLab in order to improve user interface consistency and accessibility.\nDocumentation\nâ¢\nDirection\nGlobal Search\nGlobal Search is made up of two primary experiences, Basic Search and Advanced Search.\nBasic Search is the default search experience for self-managed users as well as Free users of GitLab.com. It provides a way to search across the DevOps platform. Basic search includes Code Search for one project.\nAdvanced Search, in GitLab Premium and above, is an optional feature that uses Elasticsearch to enable additional search features for sorting, filtering, and improved relevancy.\nThis category is at the \"complete\" level of maturity.\nDocumentation\nâ¢\nDirection\nCode Search\nCode Search gives users the ability to explore all their code. Code searches are a significated portion of searches run by users, and Code Search is a fundamental need for organizations with complex or large amounts of code and multiple repositories.\nThis category is at the \"complete\" level of maturity.\nDocumentation\nâ¢\nDirection\nPricing\nThe Foundations stage has several features that enable users to quickly get started with using GitLab. These features are available in Core and are Free. However, as we move into specific use-cases for Enterprise customers that need to manage their GitLab organization at scale, features will be introduced into paid tiers as well and are intended to drive\ncompany-level financial goals\n.\nFull list of features by tier under Foundations stage are\nhere\nUpcoming Releases\n18.4 (2025-09-18)\nDirect Transfer General Availability\nOther Interesting Items\nThere are a number of other issues that we've identified as being interesting\nthat we are potentially thinking about, but do not currently have planned by\nsetting a milestone for delivery. Some are good ideas we want to do, but don't\nyet know when; some we may never get around to, some may be replaced by another\nidea, and some are just waiting for that right spark of inspiration to turn\nthem into something special.\nRemember that at GitLab, everyone can contribute!
