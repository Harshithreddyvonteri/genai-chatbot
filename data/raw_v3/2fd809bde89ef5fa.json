internal personas\nEddie (Content Editor)\nDana (Data Analyst)\nThe Handbook\nProduct Handbook\nPersonas\nPersonas\nRoles vs personas\nPersonas describe the ideal target for GitLab. They help us define our messaging and marketing delivery. They are theoretical people to target. By defining their concerns and where they go for information, we can best spend our marketing dollars and sales efforts by focusing on this ideal target.\nRoles are distinct job titles. These are the real people you will encounter while selling. You will find a contact at an account with a specific role. Understanding the challenges faced by each role in IT, along with what they care most about, is helpful to deliver the right value proposition to the right person.\nPersonas\nPersonas are a generalized way of talking about the ideal target we are aiming to communicate with and design for. They help us not only define our messaging and marketing delivery, but also our product. Keeping personas in mind allows us to use the correct language and make the best decisions to address their specific problems and pain points. GitLab has both\nbuyer\nand\nuser\npersona types.\nBuyer personas\nWe are iterating on updates to buyer personas on this\nBuyer Persona\npage.\nUser personas\nUser personas are people who actually use GitLab. They may or may not be the person in\nthe organization who has the authority and budget to purchase GitLab, but they\nare heavy influencers in the buying process. Users personas are created from data gathered from UX research studies. If a new user persona is needed, or an existing persona has to be updated, see our handbook guide on\nHow to Create a User Persona\n.\nHow do user personas interact?\nWhile user personas are often distinct individuals it is equally important to understand how multiple personas interact as to understand the workflows and motivations of individual personas.\nAs a result we will also consider:\nOrganization Archetype\nPersona Composition\nOrganizational Archetype\nOrganizational archetypes describe how organizations have structured their software development process and teams.\nThey help us understand common structures and the resulting types of interactions that the personas in those structures experience.\nWe’ll build out descriptions of common organizational archetypes as our research continues\nand introduce new personas that fit into these new organization archetypes.\nIt can happen that a persona from one organizational archetype will have similar jobs-to-be-done,\nor other characteristics, as one or even multiple personas from another organizational archetype.\nDescribing all of them will help us understand the differences that could otherwise go unnoticed\nand make better-focused decisions during product development.\nLearn more\nabout the organizational archetypes GitLab is addressing.\nList of User Personas\nWe describe the following personas in terms of the jobs they do, their motivations and frustrations. Understanding our users through this lens helps us contribute to a product that supports their workflow.\nParker, Product Manager\nDelaney, Development Team Lead\nPresley, Product Designer\nSasha, Software Developer\nPriyanka, Platform Engineer\nJanell, Enablement Advocate\nSidney, Systems Administrator\nRachel, Release Manager\nSimone, Software Engineer in Test\nAllison, Application Ops\nIngrid, Infrastructure Operator\nDakota, Application Development Director\nAmy, Application Security Engineer\nIsaac, Infrastructure Security Engineer\nAlex, Security Operations Engineer\nCameron, Compliance Manager\nDaphne, Data Scientist\nMia, ML Engineer\nUser Personas across stages\nOur personas span across stages (see table below for a depiction of how our user personas map across stages). Understanding how our personas map across stages helps us understand how to collaborate cross-functionally to support their needs.\nNote: To change the table above, team members can edit the\nGoogle Slide deck\n.\nUser Personas across Use Cases\nNote: To change the tables above, team members can edit the\nGoogle Slide deck\n.\nParker (Product Manager)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nProgram Manager, Project Manager, Technical Product Manager, Head of Product\nJob Summary\nAt the center of many facets in product development, I am responsible for shaping strategic visions, translating them into actionable plans, and ensuring that our products meet user needs and deliver real value. While my role extends beyond tactical responsibilities, I recognize the critical nature of managing day-to-day tasks which drive successful execution, even though they may not be my favorite part of the role. I strive to create strong relationships, align teams towards common goals, and ensure stakeholders buy-in to the vision for successful product development. My toolkit must include data-driven decisions, market awareness, effective communication, and a clear strategic vision.\nMotivations\nSolving Complex Problems and Delivering User Value: I find deep satisfaction and motivation in tackling challenging problems head-on. My drive stems from the opportunity to develop innovative solutions that meet user needs and create real value, culminating in a richer user experience and making a positive impact in the day-to-day lives of our users while driving value and increasing revenue for my organization.\nTaking Products from Concept to Launch: The process of taking a product from concept to launch excites and motivates me. I get satisfaction from taking part in the evolution of an idea into a fully realized product, navigating challenges, guiding development, and observing the impact with users.\nAdapting to Change and Achieving Alignment: I’m proud when I can adapt to shifting company objectives and maintain effective communication with my team. I am always working to achieve alignment across teams, knowing that it fuels our ability to achieve ambitious goals and innovate together.\nFrustrations\nBeing Stuck in a “Project, Not Product”, Management Role: It’s demotivating when I find myself primarily functioning as a project manager, focusing on tracking tasks and timelines rather than the dynamic and strategic responsibilities that come with being a product manager. This hinders my ability to address customer needs, devise effective market strategies, and maintain a clear product vision, which drives my job satisfaction.\nWasting Time, Development Capacity, and Ultimately Money: Wasted efforts and resources on products that fail to gain traction or meet user needs is disheartening. I feel frustrated when we invest in solutions that go unused or lack a clear purpose, especially when there is little meaningful user value or overall product success.\nInability to access project status quickly: It can be frustrating when it is difficult to obtain the status of work efforts and I am forced to spend time chasing status. Timely awareness of project status, especially when it is off track, is crucial for my role because I need to ensure people invested in delivery are informed if we will not meet our commitments.\nBalancing Product Vision and Capacity: I am constantly trying to make the most of our team’s capacity to execute on our product vision. It’s a challenging juggling act to ensure I am making the right decisions on what comes next to maximize our ability to deliver compelling value to the market.\nUnpredictable Timeframes, Feature Delays, and Deprioritization: It’s frustrating when I’m tasked with providing clients and stakeholders with a reasonable timeframe for the delivery of a feature since development cycles can be unpredictable, and change is inevitable.\nDelaney (Development Team Lead)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nTechnical Manager, Software Engineering Team Lead, Technical Team Lead, Software Development Director, Development Lead, Head of Development\nJob Summary\nI am responsible for meeting with the product management team to discuss and schedule features, so we can convert concepts into practical solutions. I ensure that capacity is properly estimated, create program specifications, and often mentor junior developers.\nMotivations\nWhen discussing feature requests, I want to receive clear requirements from the product and design teams, so my team can deliver on time and reduce back-and-forth communication.\nWhen assessing team resources, I want to see a history of how accurately developers on my team have estimated their capacity, so that I can assign them to the right tasks.\nWhen important deadlines are approaching, I want all team members to reliably update our tools, so that I can track progress without having to search for relevant information in other communication channels.\nFrustrations\nIt can be difficult for my team to do thorough code reviews in a reasonable timeframe, while still making progress on their own assignments.\nWhen demand surpasses our current capacity, it can be stressful to resolve issues while not creating new ones that result from hasty work.\nI am not always aware of the best way to explain technical limitations to stakeholders who are not involved in the development process.\nPresley (Product Designer)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nUX Designer, Interaction Designer, UI/UX Designer, UI Designer, Experience Designer\nJob Summary\nMy goal is to translate the product’s mission into an effective, empathetic, and efficient user experience. I am responsible for understanding user needs and product requirements, in order to conceptualize and design the graphic elements and components needed to shape the user interface. I collaborate primarily with product managers and developers, in addition to working with other stakeholders such as UX research and marketing.\nMotivations\nWhen a deliverable is requested, I want to have clear, up-to-date requirements that I can reliably refer back to throughout the design process.\nWhen collaborating with other designers, I want to be able to see who has edited a file so that I can confirm whether changes were made intentionally.\nWhen presenting deliverables to stakeholders, I want to be able to make updates to a design without having to edit a series of files in various tools.\nWhen developers are implementing my designs, I want to easily keep track of changes that go live in production, so that I can alert them of any needed fixes.\nFrustrations\nIt’s frustrating to have to create a file in one tool, export the file, create a prototype in another tool, and use a separate tool to handoff the design to developers.\nIt can be difficult to ensure that stakeholders are looking at up-to-date designs, when carrying out an iterative feedback process.\nIt can be challenging to get access to more resources, when my company does not have a defined way to prove design value to stakeholders.\nSasha (Software Developer)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nSoftware Engineer, Application Developer, Digital Solutions Developer, Consultant, Database Developer, Mobile Developer\nJob Summary\nI spend the majority of my time focused on completing planned development tasks, with roughly 30-40% of time taken by meetings, planning for the next sprint, and fixing bugs or customer requests as they arise. I work off of issues and have a regular stand-up with my team.\nMotivations\nWhen I’m planning work, I want to have better communication between stakeholders, so I can deliver something they really need and use.\nWhen I’m on-call, I want to be the expert on some part of the system, so I know that I’m a valuable part of the team.\nWhen collaborating with a large number of developers, I want to see a record of everyone’s changes, so we can pinpoint and unwind mistakes.\nWhen I’m pairing with my teammates, I want to learn new tools and skills, so I can keep growing in my career.\nWhen I’m making changes, I want to deliver secure and performant code, so I can ensure the integrity of my organization’s software is not compromised.\nFrustrations\nI’m frustrated when requirements change after work has already begun on a project.\nI’m frustrated when work is inaccurately scoped, because it causes stress and eats into time planned for other work.\nI’m frustrated when I come across brittle code and something that should be an easy fix requires a lot of rework.\nI’m concerned that by taking longer than expected on a task I may be judged or seen as blocking others’ work.\nPriyanka (Platform Engineer)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nDevOps Engineer, Operations Engineer, Systems Engineer, IT Consultant\nJob Summary\nMy job is to enable the developers to focus on the business code only. To achieve my goal, I write pipeline definitions, deployment templates, CLI tooling to be used by development teams, so the software delivery process is streamlined across organization. Beside building out these features and fixing potential bugs, I educate and support the development teams around topics related to our pipelines or target infrastructures, so they can build, deploy, and release as efficiently as possible.\nDepending on the organization and/or need of the development teams, I am part of a central platform team or a member of an application development team.\nMotivations\nWhen developers plan a project that requires my support, I want to be notified, so I can avoid unnecessary reactive work.\nWhen I resolve problems, I want to be able to track impact and other important success metrics, so I can raise my profile in the organization.\nWhen I create a solution for developers, I want to see it being used, so I know that my contributions are reliable and valued.\nWhen I’m facing a new or novel challenge, I want to whiteboard it with a teammate, so I have the satisfaction of helping solve a problem that has no manual.\nWhen I’m advocating for a new process or tool, I want to point to a metric or test, so I can support my case with something objective.\nFrustrations\nIt is hard for me to quantify my efforts and convince others of time that will be saved in the future by investing time in proactive tasks in the present.\nI’m frustrated by the avoidable crises, caused by a lack of communication, that derail my work and burn up my resources.\nI dislike frequent context-switching and being responsible for some tasks that I feel I am not good at, because of the many hats my job requires me to wear.\nI’m frustrated by the politics of convincing people to adopt my recommendations.\nJanell (Enablement Advocate)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nDevOps Evangelist, Developer Productivity Engineer, Developer Advocate\nJob Summary\nMy job is to enable developers to ramp up the learning curve of modern DevOps practices - including when that adoption is not compulsory. This can include new work management, new tooling and navigating the modernization of their applications into the cloud. To achieve my goal, I write and maintain automation code that can be directly consumed by developers as dependencies as well as scaffolding templates to be sure new projects are off to a good start. In addition to CI/CD automation, this frequently this involves support for cloud deployment, kubernetes manifests and any other associated parts for a wholistic approach to moving teams onto modern application practices. This technical work frequently involves exposing company specific things to developers as an easy to use ‘service’ - for instance, registering their application with our company-wide Configuration Management Database (CMDB).\nMy job also includes being an active champion and evangelizng development teams to leverage the new assets and ways of working - this involves treating my work as though it were a product or service - managing it to be stable, fixing bugs, taking feature requests and creating and promoting release information. This also includes workshops, managing communities of practice and creating peer Q&A platforms.\nMy manager has developer productivity and enablement as a strong focus and is very interested in how our efforts accelerate onboarding to our next generation application frameworks and also how we contribute to the long term productivity gains and business value generation of the teams that adopt our enablement.\nMy job also includes influencing not just technology, but also processes and culture when they might inhibit adoption of modern application and DevOps practices and technology.\nDeveloper enablement plays such a critical role in the efficient onboarding of developers that I generally have strong input on tooling selection as I screen it for the ability to allow us to extend it.\nDepending on the organization and/or need of the development teams, I am part of a central enablement team or a member of an application development team if the team’s work has a large enough scope.\nMotivations\nWhen I build for developers, I need to accommodate a broad set of ways of working - our organization is too diverse to try to put everyone onto a single set of enablement assets.\nWhen I build dependencies for developers, I need them to be able to version lock on them so that I can safely enhance and fix the code while not creating problems for their production deployments.\nWhen I release new versions or entirely new functionality, I need it to be discoverable by developers - although we maintain email campaigns, we can’t rely on everyone consuming the information this way and it does not help new hires.\nFrustrations\nIt can be a challenge to maintain awareness of all DevOps tooling product features that I can opinionate for our team - this includes all templating functionality, all pipeline security controls and all deployment functionality.\nI’m frustrated by members of my team and development teams that do not maintain appropropriate versions and version management discipline as I am then accused of being the source of production problems.\nI’m sometimes frustrated by the burden of maintaining custom training or other enablement content to articulate how our DevOps processes work within our tooling.\nIt can be very challenging to provide standardized, end-to-end enablement for specific new patterns since each team feels that all of the organic elements evolved into their currently approach are absolutely necessary - it’s hard to get them to simplify by reconsidering not just their DevOps code - but their team processes as well.\nSidney (Systems Administrator)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nSystems Engineer, Database Administrator, Infrastructure Engineer, Site Availability Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer\nJob Summary\nI maintain and scale our infrastructure and configurations, and my priority is to automate as much as possible. When needed, I also build servers and help developers deploy to them.\nMotivations\nWhen I get asked for help multiple times on the same task, I want to automate that task, to save time and avoid mistakes in the future.\nWhen I’m on-call, I want to receive tiered notifications, so that the true emergencies don’t get lost in the noise.\nWhen I’m releasing an improvement, I want no one to notice, so I know that it has gone smoothly.\nFrustrations\nI’m frustrated by the large volume of reactive work that I face.\nI’m frustrated by the number of channels (email, Skype, SMS, Slack, pager) on which I receive on-call notifications.\nI’m frustrated when I get inundated by requests from people who have not followed the correct process.\nI’m frustrated when developers do not implement my recommendations, and I’m responsible for fixing their preventable problems anyway.\nRachel (Release Manager)\nJobs to be done\nI am responsible for coordinating a deployment to production. I push the last button in our pipeline; i.e. changing the load balancers to point to the latest deployment.\nI coordinate the release by defining the scope and tasks for delivery.\nI am in charge of external communications around a release, especially assembling changelogs or release notes.\nI organize a response room if necessary to bring in everyone that may need to support a release\nMotivations\nI want a smooth deployment\nI want to make sure everything in the pipeline will work, because it’s the last thing that happens before it’s moved to production. If you ship something into production that shouldn’t be there, that can be catastrophic.\nEvery time the CI/CD pipelines run to green or catch issues when needed, I can sleep calmly.\nChallenges\nDealing with archaic infrastructure, such as slow connections and outdated equipment, can make it difficult to ensure everyone has the files they need to contribute and manage the pipeline.\nEnsuring enough developers, Product Managers, etc. are available to support projects.\nUI testing isn’t automated so that takes time out of the testing process.\nCoordinating all the different teams across a release can be challenging and requires a lot of follow up to ensure they play their part when they should.\nTools\nGitLab\nJIRA (for tickets from non-technical users)\nTrello (for planning issues and communication)\nSlack (for communication)\nSimone (Software Engineer in Test)\nAlternative Job Titles:\nSoftware Development Engineer in Test\nMy role\nI’m a software engineer in my organization with a keen interest in quality and the skills necessary to promote it. My objective is to\nhelp build quality into the development process\nand\npromote ownership of quality across every team\n. To accomplish this, I develop tooling to support test processes and quality reporting. I also write tests at every level in the\ntest pyramid\n. I groom my organization’s tests to make them both efficient and effective as well as help grow a quality mindset across departments.\nJobs to be done\nDevelop and maintain test frameworks:\nI need to provide the engineers in my organization with one or more well-maintained test frameworks that facilitate writing tests at the appropriate level.\nProvide tooling and reporting to facilitate quality:\nI need to create and maintain both tooling and reporting that allows developers to more easily accomplish quality-related tasks and provide feedback to engineering and management.\nPerform quality planning with counterparts:\nI want to interact with my engineering counterparts on a regular basis, tracking what is coming up for development as well as what is happening now and what is being delivered. Knowing this, I need to be able to identify both the riskiest and most important work being done so I can provide quality feedback at the appropriate time through performing code reviews and having discussions about both the design and implementation of the features.\nManage Test Environments\nI also provision and maintain test environments that are representative of the software being used in production.
