From project planning and source code management, to CI/CD, security, and monitoring GitLabâs capabilities are built-in as part of the app so you donât have to integrate multiple tools.\nBenefits of a single application\nReduce risk with a single set of permissions\nRather than having to manage authentication and authorization across many tools. GitLab has a single login and one place to set permissions so everyone has the correct access.\nReduce costs with less administrative overhead\nWith a single application to install, configure, and maintain thereâs less administrative overhead. Since fewer staff needed to administer a single application verse a complex toolchain more of your engineering resources can be allocated towards development of features for your users.\nIncrease speed with a lower time to resolution\nWhen a build pipeline fails how do you troubleshoot? Is it a problem with the infrastructure or did new code fail a test? Perhaps there is state in the original specification that needed to help debug. With traditional toolchains the issue tracker, code repository, and CI/CD pipeline are all separate tools. When teams need to troubleshoot they have to pass state back and forth in a ticket because they likely donât all have access to the same applications.\nWith GitLab, everyone who needs to help troubleshoot a failure has access to all of the data. Pipeline, code, comments, issues, and test results all appear on the merge request so thereâs a single view. With everyone on the same page troubleshooting is much simpler and things get up and running faster.\nSee more benefits of a single application\nOn this page\nThe DevOps toolchain tax\nSingle application architecture\nBenefits of a single application\n50%+ of the Fortune 100 trust GitLab\nStart shipping better software faster\nSee what your team can do with the intelligent\nDevSecOps platform.\nGet free trial\nTalk to sales",
