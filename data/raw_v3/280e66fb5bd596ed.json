We focus on delivering maximum value to\nSMB and Mid-Market\ncustomers throughout their entire journey with GitLab.\nCommercial Team Groups\nSMB Account Executives\nMid Market Account Executives\nArea Sales Managers\nGetting Started as a New Hire\nPlease ensure you read the\nCommercial Sales onboarding page\n.\nTop Tips to Onboard Quicker\nBookmark the relevant SalesForce dashboard for your region, this is essential to your success. Your Manager will give you the link when you first join.\nGet familiar with the\nclose date conventions\nused in Commercial Sales.\nEnsure you fully understand\nthe Required 7\n. Your teammates and manager are more than happy to help you with this if you need it.\nRead through reviews of GitLab to get an idea of what customers think about the product. Two good places to start are\nSoftwareadvice.com\nand\nGartner Reviews\n.\nWatching videos is core to your onboarding. You can watch YouTube & Chorus videos at 1.5x or 1.75x speed to get through them efficiently, you can still retain the information but in less time. Go to the Settings widget > Playback speed.\nWhen you first start, searching through Slack is a great way to find useful information as it’s our primary method of asking questions and announcing things to the company. Some channels that are particularly good for information:\n#questions\n#sales\n#competition\nUse\nBuiltWith.com\nto get an idea of what technologies a customer is using currently (though be sure to verify this with them)\nYou might find it useful to create a Google doc to document all your learnings in your first 30 days, as you will get a lot of information to remember and it will also get you in the habit of taking notes, a\nkey part of GitLab’s culture\n.\nYou can never have too many\ncoffee chats\nwith colleagues. You don’t need to ask permission from people, just put some time in their diary.\nMake sure your calendar is always up to date so that you can get meetings from SDRs without having to moving them around.\nListen to as many\nChorus\ncalls as possible. They are an excellent way to onboard.\nAdd your own tips to this page as you onboard to pay it forward for the next new rep!\nGet familiar with GitLab and seaching for Issues, MR’s and handbook pages. This will significantly speed things up as you progress through onboarding.\nContinuous Learning\nBelow is a list of resources considered highly valuable for continuous learning and development by Commercial Sales team members at GitLab. Note, that some of these resources are not publicly available, so consult a fellow teammate for access where necessary.\nGitLab Direction\nIncludes GitLab’s Vision,\nMaturity\nframework and planned features and their release dates within each of GitLab’s\nPaid Tiers\n.\nGitLab Blog\nMonthly articles on Releases, Engineering, Open Source, Culture and other popular topics of interest.\nGitLab Unfiltered YouTube\nA YouTube channel private to GitLab employees with video recordings and playlists on company meetings, enablement sessions and other topics. Access GitLab’s\nSales Enablement playlist\n.\nChorus Recordings\nOur team’s history of call and demo recordings is a valuable training resource for new and existing sales team members.\nSales & SDR Enablement Sessions\nWeekly training sessions covering popular product, market and sales training topics chosen by the sales and marketing team members.\nProduct Study Guide\nA study course for team members to understand the current full scope of capabilities offered in each tier of GitLab and reasons for tier upgrades.\nSales Training\npage\nCommercial Sales Enablement\npage\nEvents\nWhen traveling please consider ROI of both any costs plus your time:\nIf you are going to an event you think first:\nWhat is the total you will spend for travel?\nWhat is the total you will spend on food and lodging for me?\nWhat is the amount you will likely spend on customer meals (meals x customers x # of times)?\nHow many total business hours will you be away from salesforce?\n8 hours: then you need to get 5x return on $, and the fact that any event pipeline closes at about 30%\nHow many total personal life hours will you be away from your personal life?\nGiven the rough calculation above, you’ve to be committed driving/booking enough Net ARR at the event prior to you going to the event\nNote: this doesn’t mean you can’t get travel approval without booking meetings. It means once you get travel approval it is on you to go get people to the event/meetings to create pipeline.\nTrip Notes\nThe ultimate purpose of attending any GitLab field event is to gain insight and add value. Sid Sijbrandij, our co-founder, talks about the importance of conferences and events\nhere\n. He believes the main goal of GitLab team participation should always be to connect with our customers and prospects and not to solely attend presentations. Trip notes are our internal process for tracking and capturing this data.\nWhy and When?\nTrip notes are required for the entire Commercial Sales Team anytime a team member travels for the company while working at GitLab. We believe it would be fun and valuable if you also shared trip notes when you traveled for personal reasons; however, that is up to your discretion.\nHow to properly document your trip notes?\nPlease follow the best practice process and use the\ntrip note template\nas a format to prepare for your future trip.\nTrip Notes Best Practice\nCommercial attendee will write up their notes in a google doc.\nPlease save your notes as GitLab internal read only for Commercial Team review in the\nCommercial Sales Drive Trip Notes Folder\n.\nOnce saved, please slack and share a link to your notes in the commercial_global_all channel to alert the team of your recent trip.\nFinally, please share your\nPost Trip feedback\nfor the entire company and the Field Marketing team directly in the specific Event Issue on the ‘Post Event Recap & Feedback’ spreadsheet.\nGive Back Project\nWhat is the Give Back Project?\nThe Give Back Project is a self-selected opportunity to help the Commercial Sales team achieve better results. It is a finite project that, upon completion, is to be adopted by no less than 70% of the Commercial Sales team and used at least once a month.\nThe Give Back Project is assigned to all new Commercial Sales team members and is required to be completed as part of their on-boarding process.\nWhy is there a Give Back Project?\nThe goal of the Give Back Project is to allow new team members to be able to instantly contribute to the Commercial Sales team\nFosters GitLab’s values of collaboration and results\nThe Give Back Project gives team members the opportunity to be exposed to problems on the team today and will allow the team to look back and see how we addressed shortcomings in the past\nHow to properly document a Give Back Project\nGive Back Projects are described and worked by team members in the\nCommercial Sales issue tracker\nIf it is something that needs to be repeated (like a customer AMA) an associated handbook entry is created with a description on how a new person could achieve this\nAlthough the Give Back Project is designed to be finite, there is always room for iteration at GitLab. Be sure to include any necessary instructions on how a different team member would be able to add to your project if necessary\nExample Give Back Projects\nCustomer AMAs:\nMeetings for GitLab team members with current customers that provide an opportunity to ask them about anything in regard to their experience with GitLab\nCustomer Meetings:\nSharing the best practices for conducting any kind of external meeting at GitLab\nTrip Notes:\nallows team members who attend field events to track and capture data in order for the rest of the team to gain insight\nDoing Business with Partners/Channels:\nGuidelines on how to work with partners and resellers in order to ensure value is maximized in these areas\nHow to Handle New Customers After They Purchase:\nBest practices for handling new GitLab customers based on the scope of their purchase\nTechnical Evaluation of Customers:\nHow to properly evaluate a customer’s current technical environment in order to create organizational alignment and prescribe how GitLab can best solve their problems\nFor a complete list of our Give Back Projects and other Onboarding assignments our team is working on, please click the private link\nhere\n.\nPaid Time Off (PTO) and Results\nWe have found following steps beneficial to make the process of time off easy for Sales and keep business continuity.  This does not serve as a replacement to the company wide\nGuide to Paid Time Off\nor add process for\nSick Time Policy\n. This is the expanded approach to preparing yourself and the team for time off planned specific to the group.\nInform Manager as in the GitLab team members guide to time off\nAsk a regional team member for coverage and share planned time off\nSelect someone ideally in similar role and who has capacity to cover while OOO\nIt may be helpful to create a shared doc of action items, and follow reference from the handbook\nThere may be cases where double coverage or support from your manager is needed if no one else is available\nNote: For\nFamily & Friends Day\n, there is no need for backup coverage as it is a publicly visible shutdown for GitLab. Please message in your below OOO auto-reply as such including the handbook page, and contact details for technical support\nSubmit time-off in Time Off by Deel in Slack, and add your chosen team member who is covering for you as the assignee role for all tasks, you can label it something like “immediate and general”\nCreate calendar invite with title:\nEx: “First and Last Name OOO - (First and Last Name) is Covering”. Optional invite to your manager and person covering.\nBlock the morning of your return date on your calendar so you can return to work with catch-up time for things like:\nRe-submitting forecast in Clari\nRanking new accounts that came through\nRespond to email, support tickets, via Required 7\nOptionally schedule time on the return day to sync with the individual covering for you\nRole responsibilities to prepare being out of office\nAny quotes that are currently out to clients, resend via docusign with the person covering for you cc’d on them. Intro AE covering to client in case either have questions via email\nRun\nthis report\n, edit the\ndates\nfield in the top right corner to be the dates you are OOO, then select ‘run report’. Make sure ZERO next steps are falling on the dates you are out and cover anything not urgent before PTO. This will ensure you leave you without a huge workload for your backup or you in return.\nIf you have an urgent next step scheduled, reach out before vacation, inform the client you will be OOO and get either the person covering for you or your manager included by\ncc:\non the email w/ intro\nIf you have less urgent next steps approaching, assess if they should be handled before or after vacation and then edit the next steps date based on your assessment\nSet your email OOO auto-reply including the email of the person covering for you. If your manager is available the days you are out you can add them as well in the email message and any other urgent correspondence\nOn the day before time off:\nEnsure all required 7 reports are up to date\nSubmit forecast in Clari\nOptions on phone notifications related to work:\nEncouraged: Delete apps associated with work such as email and slack\nRecommended if it is difficult to get these apps back on your phone: Silence notifications on apps associated with work\nLeave your computer closed and have a blast!\nArea Sales Managers have additional steps to consider before leaving for time off:\nSet expectations on coverage for 1:1s and team meetings\nUpdating quote approval routing in SFDC to the person covering for you. Navigate to you name dropdown - My Settings - Personal - Approver Settings.  Search for the person covering next to Delegated Approver, confirm and select Save\nIn Navan, set Vacation Delegate in Settings - Account Details\nSubmit forecast\nIf planned time off exceeds the 25 consecutive days as outlined in the guide, request temporary ASM coverage for forecasting in Clari by submitting a request in the\nSales Operations\nproject.\nRole responsibilities of covering for a team member as backup\nRespond within 24 hours to the absent AE’s customers if they contact you.\nAddress new Required 7 items that appear on your team’s Required 7 dashboard for the absent AE.\nTake any urgent customer calls or BDR/SDR calls that have been set up. If you are not able to attend for any reason, you are expected to tell your manager so that appropriate backup can be found. Customer or prospect calls on the calendar should not be delayed or rescheduled.\nWork on and close deals in the absent AE’s territory while they are out.\nBackup AEs are not required to:\nCover tasks unrelated to the specific AE role. For example, if the absent AE is a member of a Team Member Resource Group (TMRG), you are not expected to attend TMRG meetings.\nOutbound campaigns to the absent AE’s customers (you can if you want to, of course).\nAgree to be a backup if you do not have time to do so, or cover multiple team members. There are other AEs who can help.\nForecast on behalf of the absent AE. Only update their opportunities as needed.\nRequired 7\nNew team members should familiarize themselves with\nThe Required 7\n. These are the 7 tactical skills required to be an excellent Commercial Sales Account Executive:\nRanking your accounts\n-\nvideo here\nRank all accounts and explain why; log your sources for future efficiency; this needs to be your (recent) ranking, not the previous owners, nor the ranking from the prior fiscal. If it’s unchanged, make the note that it is unchanged and why\nBuilding your (consider changing the deck)\ncustom deck\nfor any opp amount over $5k SMB $10k MM\nAmount\n(n.b. amount, not Net ARR) that:\nCalculates the ROI of using GitLab vs. next best option (this might be vs. do nothing)\nProvides the 2 options for the customer going forward - normally both with GitLab (example: Ult or Prem)\nDemonstrates a customised vision for the customer: “what if you used all of GitLab to do DevOps in a single app?”\nCapture the full response, in the customers’ words to that vision and the reasons why they think it is possible, or not possible. This capture can be done in the speaker notes so your customer can validate and then copied into an activity after the call.\nvideo here\n, and be sure to check out\nthis video\non creating an effective ROI slide deck and\nthis supporting deck\nCapturing key information:\nHow did the customer/prospect hear about GitLab and what is their understanding of what we do?\nMeaningful information on why we won/lost a deal\nLogging your\ncall notes\nvideo on taking efficient notes during a meeting\nand top tips from a top performer\nhere\nUpdating your next steps\n-\nvideo here\nCommand plans\n, what needs to be filled in:\n$5k SMB, $10k MM\nAmount\n- All fields in opportunity overview (the whys) and close-plan over this Amount threshold\n$10k SMB, $20k MM\nNet ARR\n- Full Command Plan over this Net ARR threshold\nIf you don’t yet know the answers or have the data, you will populate the Command Plan fields with your script and next steps to get that information\nException to command plan: for channel managed opportunities we may not have access - put\nChannel-Managed\nin the opportunity title\n(\ntraining session here\nand\ntraining deck here\n)\nKeeping your opportunities\nup to date at all times\nvideo\nAccount Ranking\nIt is a requirement for the Commercial Sales Team to tier their accounts using the fields on the Account Object. This helps prioritize the accounts to go after when prospecting for new or expansion. Please see below definitions specific to SMB and Mid-Market AEs.\nRanking Training and Definitions\nCommercial Sales: Account Ranking Training Clippet\nSMB Account Executive Definitions for Account Ranking\nRank 1: Top 10 Accounts with new business or upselling possibility within the next 12 months\nRank 1.5: Future opportunities that we should not lose track of as there is a sales opportunity here with no timeline\nRank 2: Believe there is an opportunity, but will take additional work before opening and beginning a sales cycle\nRank 3: Greenfield, SDR attention - perhaps a drip campaign\nSMB AE must have potential user field filled in on the account object for Rank 1, and 1.5\nSMB AE must have the notes section filled in on why an account is Rank 2 or 3\nMid-Market Account Executive Definitions for Account Ranking\nRank 1: Accounts that I am working to maximize their Net ARR this fiscal year.\nRank 1.5 The subset of Rank 2 that is best and trending toward being future Rank 1s.\nRank 2 Accounts that I am working to grow and I speak with them at least once a month.\nRank 3 Accounts that I keep informed about GitLab and DevOps monthly.\nClose Date Conventions\nFirst, forecasting, down to even the opportunity level, is a routine exercise for accuracy, not motivation or aspiration. Each week on Wednesday it is required to update five values in Clari by close of business (5 PM) local time.  This is Renewal Loss Best Case, Renewal Loss Best Case, Gross Net ARR Best Case, Gross Net ARR Commit, and Net 50/50.  At this time, it is required to double-check pipeline cleanliness and always follow the close date conventions listed here.\nThe close date should always be in the month that you believe it has the most likely chance of closing (with only one exception as dictated below).\nAt\nall times\nthe Net ARR amount should reflect your best estimate of the actual amount that the opportunity will have on it when it closes in the month reflected in the close date. There are no exceptions other than returning from an onsite visit, even if you have not spoken with the account. If you get a new opp you should quickly assess the account and, given your experience, make an educated guess on what amount the company will transact at.\nThe Stage represents where you believe the customer is in their buying process, not only the specific steps they have taken with you.\nThe three close dates:\nLast day of the month it will close in\nonly if you have a compelling event defined\nThe actual day the opportunity will close when the quote goes out for signature. It will appear past due if we don’t get the signature back and pushes to the Friday of the week it should close.  Renewals default to this convention\nFirst day of the following month, no compelling event defined\nPlacing the close date on the first day of the month is a temporary status of\nup to 48 hours\nduring which time the AE would work directly with their Champion / Economic Buyer to confirm the compelling event and client timeline.  Once determined, the AE would move the close date to the last day of the month of actual closing.\nThis close date carries a window of roughly 60 days of when you think it will come in\nExample\n: It’s April 23rd, a new business Mid-Market opportunity is identified for a company at 410 employees and growing at an unknown rate (unclear due to being an agency). The company completed their evaluation with a trial ending this month, there are defined problems initially trying to solve, with some people who have used GitLab before.\nQuestion for AE and self, what % chance of the purchase occurring in April, May, or June?\n90% April, 10% May\nChorus recordings\nA recording Chorus license is mandatory for all Commercial Account Executives. Our intent is to record customer calls for the following reasons:\nFor training, to make sure we are giving customers the best possible experience\nTo give to the customer as a visual record of our conversations with them\nTo verify any details we may have missed in the conversation\nMandatory steps required to record calls\nFollow instructions for using\nChorus Scheduler\nDeal Reviews\nProject 35\nAs we continue to grow as an organization, developing our sales skills to deliver an impeccable sales experience is a critical component of the customer experience, either leading them to enjoy working with GitLab or not, depending on the quality of that experience. We’ve created a program called “Project 35” to help you improve your selling skills. We are utilizing our largest opportunities for the quarter to hone in our selling skills with the goal of these skills being valuable on all other sales opportunities.\nAs part of Project 35 we will be focusing on the following core selling skills:\nRunning excellent sales calls & importance of pre-call prep\nStronger discovery to uncover Command Plan (why now, why GitLab, why do anything at all)\nBuilding ROI\nFinding & cultivating champions\nNegotiation\nComplex Deal Management\nCollaboration - amongst peers and leadership\nPreparation for your next role & large deal management\nDuring a Project 35 call, The AE who is discussing their opportunity will answer the following questions:\nPrep for a no. What are all the questions or reasons they will say no?\nAre we building a relationship (onsite, something else?)\nNail the project name and the timing of the project (sell services)\nSelling against a ROI slide\nBased on the information uncovered in the prior questions, use supporting reasons for AEs to update their next steps live. Managers should enter their comments in the Manager Notes section for any deals they review live or asynchronously.\nEngage wider sales team. Who are, by name, the CSMs, SAs, Partners that are helping sell the deal. Please assign them to the discussion in the document so that they are able to join the call and contribute to the discussion.\nOpportunity Consults and Lightweight Deal Reviews\nAn\nOpportunity Consult\n(OCF) is an in depth, two-way conversation between the AE and the ASM to review the opportunity\nCommand Plan\n. The AE should expect to provide the ASM with more detailed information about the\nOpportunity Overview\nfields, the customer’s pain points and desired outcomes, challenges or gaps in qualification aligned to the\nMEDDPPICC\nopportunity qualification framework, articulate a\nClose Plan\nand identify the biggest opportunity risk(s) and action(s) to mitigate those risks.\nA Lightweight Deal Review (LDR) is a shorter (5-10 minute) deal review that is designed to identify gaps in the\nCommand Plan\nand specific next steps. At the end of an LDR, an AE and ASM should have a plan in place to capture the information that is not in the Command Plan, and a specific plan of action on and before the next call.\nOpportunity Next Steps Best Practices\nAlways keep Next Steps Date and Next Steps up to date as an assignment to a future version of yourself on how you will take action to continue the customers buying process.\nWhen you start your day you need to check all inputs like email, zendesk, and lead queue so you can triage those requests into your priorities for that day.\nAllocate times of your day in four ways:\nCustomer meetings scheduled\nProactive email and internal efforts\nProactive calling efforts\nTime to check inputs again\nWhen beginning a proactive time block, open your opportunities view and sort by Next Steps Date.\nYour Next Steps should be specific and compelling so that you can take action on them within 3 minutes of reading.\nNext Steps\nshould contain\nonly\nthe actions you will take next: no dates, no history, just the Next Steps\nWhen you update\nNext Steps\n, the\nNext Steps History\nwill automatically capture your prior\nNext Steps\n, applying a date stamp and storing them in reverse-chronological order\nPlease Note:\nIf you previously included history in the\nNext Steps\nfield, the next time you update\nNext Steps\nyou will need to clear the field completely and input only your Next Steps\nOpportunity-Specific Slide Deck\nIt is required that all opportunities above $10,000 (Mid Market) and $5,000 (SMB) in total amount (not Net ARR) will have a custom slide deck that is shared with the customer or prospect. The custom deck must be attached to the opportunity by pasting the deck link in the SalesForce field ‘Link to Custom Pitch Deck’ on the opportunity home page. This will enable Mid Market Account Executives and SMB Account Executives to capture critical account information. Additionally, this will facilitate selling on value rather than features.\nCustom Deck Requirements\nVisual Requirements\nDeck’s main color will match or resemble that of the customer’s.\nWhere possible, use the customer’s logo.\nIt is appropriate to ask the customer for a blank template.\nCustomer Agreed-upon Agenda\nWhen meeting with the customer, leverage an agreed upon agenda to aide in co-selling.\nCalculated ROI of GitLab v. Next Best Option\nFor New Business the next best option could be ‘do nothing’ or our competition.\nFor Renewals the next best option could be to go back to what they were doing before.\nTwo options (rough plans) with GitLab going forward\nFor new business this takes the form of\nTwo Lane Selling\nwhere we give them a high engagement and a low engagement option.\nFor a renewal, this could be a one year v. a three year option, or Premium v. Ultimate.\nNon-Custom Single Application pitch to the customer\nThis slide should have a visual representation of using GitLab as a single application for the entire software development life cycle.\nThe intent of this slide is to have the conversation with the customer on ‘what is possible’, and to capture their feedback\nFull capture of the customer’s feedback on the ‘Single Application’ slide\nCapture the customer’s actual words in the speaker notes of the ‘single application’ slide\nRed / Green Process and Procedures\nRed / Green Purpose\nEffective ASM coaching of the why now, why do anything, why GitLab and specific next steps the Account Executive will take with the prospect/client. The goal of the red/green process is to accurately forecast which opportunities will close for each designated fiscal period (Month/Quarter). The red/green process is  meant to most acutely build skills around identifying the timeline that is most comfortable for the customer to close.\nRed / Green Definition\nDesignating each opportunity that has a shot to close at the end of each fiscal period as either Red (not going to close before the end of the month), or Green (going to close before the end of the month), and updating manager notes with a defense of the color and a specific next step the AE will complete by the next check in (usually the next day). For context, a green account will have a “why now” that corresponds with a close before the end of the period.\n- The threshold (unless otherwise stated) for accounts that will be reviewed during Red/Green is:\n- SMB: $2,000 NetARR or greater\n- Mid-Market: $7,000 NetARR or greater\nRed / Green Tactics\nRed/Green meetings are held the 15th (or closest non-weekend day prior to the 15th) of each month, and the last five work days of the month.\nArea Sale Managers should conduct R/G meetings live with each of their Account Executives. This discussion should not be held asynchronously. Checklist of items below in this order. Advance to next question once prior is confident\nIs this opportunity Red or Green?\nWhy do anything at all?\nWhy GitLab?\nWhy now? (Is there a time-driven reason this opportunity will close within a specific time frame)\nWhat level is your closest relationship with?\nHow can they help you:\nGet accurate information on the ideal time for the customer to buy GitLab?\nGet you access to someone else in the organization who has access to the above information?\nWhat is the AEs immediate next step based on the answer to the items above? If anything less than “wait for account to move from closing to closed-won”, then see “Why Now” question.\nAn example of a specific next step would be to ask your closest contact: “Is this at all easier for you if we close this next month?”\nOnce Red/Green discussion is complete on the account, the ASM will enter notes in the “manager notes” section of the opportunity to reflect the discussion and the immediate next step the account executive will take.\nRepeat the same process the following date for all accounts above the threshold.\nRed / Green Outcome\nHit the forecast we commit to and build better sales skills for our AEs and better coaching skills for our ASMs.\n- Ideal skills that need to be built are:\n- Understanding the concepts and execution around knowing the ideal timeline the customer wants to close.\n- Identifying pain and having customers understand both the negative impacts of not switching to GitLab as well as the realized positive business outcomes by switching to GitLab.\n- Building a time-bound mutual success plan with the customer based on the severity or the ability for the customer to devote resources to a project.\nRed / Green Lookback Process\nAt the first R/G meeting of the following period, the leadership team will submit their actual closed-won for the prior period as well as their final R/G commitment. Team will then discuss the reasons why each finished where they did and identify any items that led to variation from commitment.\nSMB Account Executives\nSMB Account Executives “SMB AEs” act as Account Executives and the face of GitLab for\nSMB\nprospects and customers. They are the primary point of contact for companies that employ between 1 to 99 employees.\nSMB Roles\nSMB Account Executives are designated into one of the following pod positions:\nFirst Order\nPooled\nExpand\nNamed\nSMB Account Executives in First Order will assist prospects in their evaluation through the first buying process. Depending on the account, the other three roles will be the customer’s primary point of contact for any renewal and expansion discussions.  Collectively the team is responsible for working new business in their\nterritory\nas well as handling the customer journey for new and existing customers.\nAMER SMB Pooled Account Executives are responsible for managing a subset of SMB customers who range from companies on day 1 of using GitLab, all the way to companies who’ve used GitLab since their day 1. The Pooled AEs work collectively in a “pooled” account ownership model meaning customers are aligned at the team level and all AEs are equipped to help. Pooled AEs work with customers to evaluate product and plan expansion, making recommendations to ensure a successful renewal with GitLab based on their needs.\nPlease read below and through the\nSMB handbook page for more information\n.\nCritical Salesforce reports to follow and bookmark\nSMB AMER Required 7\nSMB APAC/EMEA Required 7\nSMB APAC/EMEA 1:1 Dashboard\nNew Business\nWork Initial Qualification Meetings\nIQM’s\nfrom Commercial SDR Team\nAccept Sales Accepted Opportunities according to\nSAO Criteria\nNurture and help prospects during their Trial evaluation after Accepting Opportunities\nPush to Webdirect or help with the Sales Order Process\nCustomer Journey\nInbound Queue Management\nLicensing/Subscription Management\nTroubleshooting Resource for Licensing/Subscription Management\nQuotes / Sales Order Processing\nCustomer Health Check Process\nGainsight Data in SFDC Definitions\nInbound Queue Management\nZendesk:\nManaging incoming requests received through support.gitlab.com\nThe goal and focus\nof working Zendesk tickets for the SMB team is to help with\nupselling\nand\nrenewals\nWithin timezone (WIP), the Support team is responsible to take the lead on all incoming ZD tickets in the\nUpgrades, Renewals, and AR (refunds) queue\n.

Recommendations on how to work through your next steps for the day:\nSort by stage, placing highest priority stage at the top\nPrioritize the opportunities you are going to work on first by stage, amount, and close date\nEnsure “Next Steps,” “Next Step Date,” and “Next Steps Owner” are current with actionable and informative information that helps guide you on how to move the opportunity through the pipeline\nIf a potential future opportunity that requires an action is greater than 30 days out, make sure this is detailed in the next steps field\nOnce opportunities in the stages Discovery through Awaiting Signature are updated, begin working on Pending Acceptance. Continue to prioritize with the same criteria as above.\nPipeline Generation\nIn weekly communication with your direct management review the health of your pipeline and update records as needed in real-time. You should know at all times what your pipeline multiplier is and if you need to create more pipeline to have a successful month and quarter. Refer to your team’s\nPipeline Generation\nchecklist documents and the associated SFDC reports associated with keeping activity up to date.\nCommercial Sales Stages Activities and Exit Criteria\nPipeline management is key to predictable, scalable revenue attainment and can make the difference between simply hitting your number and overachieving. Proper sales pipeline management helps you allocate your time correctly, increase deal velocity, and increase total deal volume, size, and revenue through accurate forecasting practices.\nA well-managed sales pipeline requires a clear process with defined activities and exit criteria that serve as a roadmap to getting a deal from discovery to closed won (or qualified out quickly).

These GitLab team members manage the spectrum of project sizes, ranging from small fast growing teams in smaller agile organizations to complex enterprise projects advising on the journey with GitLab to achieve specific business outcomes.\nMid-Market AEs work closely in tandem with the business development team and sales management to manage a broad book of business spread over a large opportunity value range and focus on exceeding client expectations.\nMid Market Roles\nNew Logo AE\n: These AEs work on the\nBase Accounts\nthat are not currently customers of GitLab. Once the customer has signed its first contract, the customer is transitioned to the SMB, MM, or ENT segment depending on the size of the customers.\nMM Key Accounts Named AE\n(MMKAN): These AEs work on current customers that have been deemed to be high spending (high CARR) or have the potential to be high spending (high LAM). To be successful the MMKAN AE must expand their accounts more than the standard expansion rate for their named list of accounts. The named list for each MMKAN AE will grow through the fiscal year as the MMKAFO AE wins new high potential customers.\nMM Territory AE\n: These AEs work geographic regions of accounts that have not been vetted to be New Logo AE or MM Key Account named AE. The role sells to both prospects and current accounts.\n“MM Key Accounts” can be used to refer to MM Key Accounts First Order and MM Key Accounts Named collectively. MM Key Accounts are the sub-set of MM accounts with a higher\nLAM\nand potential LAM.\nCore Responsibilities\nOwn your set of accounts - build & execute your plan.\nManage book of business: new business, expansion, renewals.\nCollaborate with Sales Development channel for handover of inbound qualified opportunities to progress to closure.\nExecute outbound campaigns.\nNew Business\nWork Initial Qualification Meetings\nIQM’s\nfrom SDR Team\nAccept Sales Accepted Opportunities according to\nSAO Criteria\nNurture and help prospects during their Trial evaluation after Accepting Opportunities\nPush to Webdirect or help with the Sales Order Process\nSelecting Target Accounts for marketing\nLog into Datafox or Sales Navigator\nInput your territory criteria\nEstablish a list of accounts and sort by Company Head Count\nSearch for keywords like DevOps\nLook into each account to see if they are actually yours\nLook into each employee that is either an engineer or technology professionals\nAdd that company name to your list\nIf not enough companies through this process continue below:\nLook for the intersection of revenue and vertical in Datafox\nLook at the account in SFDC to see if CE User\nFilter using signals if using Datafox\nAssess if they have had recent funding announcements\nOnce selected add the company name, city, and zip code to your sheet\nCustomer Journey\nInbound Queue Management\nLicensing/Subscription Management\nTroubleshooting Resource for Licensing/Subscription Management\nQuotes / Sales Order Processing\nCustomer Health Check Process\nGainsight Data in SFDC Definitions\nAccount Ownership Rules of Engagement for Commercial Sales updated 2022-09-22\nThe Commercial Sales Team follows the\nAccount Ownership Rules of Engagement\nThis section provides step by step clarity on how to follow the\nROE\n.\nProcess to follow\nAccount will be organized into the following two categories:\nAccounts who were customers before February 1st of the fiscal year\nAccounts who became customers on or after February 1st of the fiscal year\nAccounts who became customers before February 1st of the fiscal year will follow this process\nIt is the responsibility of the Account Executive who owns the account to qualify how many employees the account has prior to February 1st.\nAccounts who have less than 100 employees on or before February 1st will be owned by SMB for the fiscal year\nAccounts who have 100 or more employees on or before February 1st will be owned by Mid Market for the fiscal year\nAs an Account Executive, if you qualify an account and are unsure of the rules of engagement by the number of employees or corporate address, you should screenshot the data you are reviewing, post it on the account in chatter and edit Account Rank Notes. Tag your Area Sales Manager when research is complete for further review by @ mentioning them. If the ASM has reviewed the data provided by the Account Executive as well as doing their own due diligence and is unsure of the rules of engagement, they should screenshot their research, post it on the account in chatter and tag the Regional Director for review by @ mentioning them. Finally, if a Regional Director is unsure of the rules of engagement after reviewing the data provided and doing their own due diligence, they should screenshot their research, post it on the account in chatter and tag the Regional Vice President for review and final decision. All final decisions for Commercial account and opportunity ownership are up to the sole discretion of the Regional Vice President of the Commercial Division.\nAccounts who became customers on or after February 1st of the fiscal year\nAccounts will be separated into the following categories\nSales Assisted First Order\nWeb Direct First Order\nFor sales assisted first orders, it is the responsibility of the account executive who conducts the initial discovery with the prospect to research and qualify the number of employees and headquarter location for the account.\nIf the account has less than 100 employees the account will be managed by SMB for the remainder of the fiscal year\nIf the account 100 employees or greater the account will be managed by Mid Market for the remainder of the fiscal year\nIf the account has greater than 500 employees or greater than 100 LAM dev please see the Rules of Engagement Between MMKAFO and Mid-Market Territory for FY ‘23 for proper lead routing\nFor web direct first orders we understand there may be a degree of differentiation of actual employee count versus what our systems capture based on the tools utilized to enrich data. It is the responsibility of the Account Executive who owns the first order to identify the correct number of employees after the web direct first order and ensure that the employee count is not “wholly wrong”. Wholly wrong is used only for accounts that upon initial assignment are assigned by automation i.e. no team member reviewed them at first transaction.\nWholly wrong is defined as the following\nMid Market owned accounts with less than 80 employees\nSMB owned accounts with greater than 120 employees\nIf an account is wholly wrong, it is the responsibility of the account owner to chatter @sales-support to reassign the first order and the account to the correct segment.\nIf an account is not wholly wrong but above or below the segment line (respectively) is it the responsibility of the account owner to chatter @sales-support to flag the account to move to the appropriate segment at the beginning of the following fiscal year.\nAll accounts that are not researched or identified as being assigned to the wrong segment will be reassigned.\nIf the AE qualifies this and then keeps it, this can lead to disciplinary action.\nAs part of the qualification process tt is expected to qualify the location of company headquarters and employee count so we can best support the customer. It is not acceptable to qualify location and employee count in a manner that jeopardizes the customer experience. If you are unsure, always tag your manager in chatter to review the data before involving the customer.\nRules of Engagement Between MMKAFO and Mid-Market Territory for FY ‘23\nFiscal Year 2023 Account Moves\nFor all accounts that are in SalesForce.com as of February 24, 2022 the Mid-Market Key Accounts First Order team will own all accounts that are:\nSegmented to Mid-Market NORAM or EMEA\nMarked as “First Order Available” in SalesForce\nAND\nHave a full time employee count of 500 employees or greater as marked in the “Account Demographic Max Family Employees” field under Account Demographics in SFDC.\nOR\nHave a potential user count of 100 users or more as measured by the LAM Dev Count Field.\nTo avoid confusion the logic is\n[1 AND 2 AND (3 OR 4)]\n.\nNote: If an AE suspects that the employee count or potential user count is not accurate in our data sources, it is the AEs responsibility to uncover the employee count and potential user count during the discovery phase. If an account is identified to belong to either territory or First Order and the other party continues to work the lead without doing proper due diligence, the account will be reassigned to the appropriate party.\nNew Accounts to SalesForce.com after Feb 24, 2022\nFor all\ninbound\nMQLs for which an account does not yet exist in SalesForce.com, the routing of that lead and account will be based exclusively on employee count.\nIf the account has 500+ employees it will be routed to the MMKAFO team\nIf the account has less than 500 employees it will be routed to the Mid-Market Territory team\nMMKAFO AEs are able to go\noutbound\nto accounts that are not yet in SalesForce.com that fit the criteria in the Mid Market Key Accounts definition:\nMid-Market accounts that have either 500+ employees OR 100 potential users as defined by LinkedIn Engineering + IT personnel count.\nMMKAFO AEs are able to create the outbound accounts in SFDC that fit the above criteria, and ask Sales Operations to move the account into their name.\nNote: If it is found out that an AE asks for an account to be deduplicated in order to work said account, disciplinary action will be taken.\nAccount Moves Throughout Fiscal Year 2023\nIf an MMKAFO AE finds out through discovery that a sub 500 employee account segmented to First Order in reality has less than 100 potential users, they should immediately ask for the account to be moved to Territory.\nIf a “First Order Available” account is segmented to Territory, and the Territory AE finds out through discovery that the account actually has more than 500 employees, they should immediately ask for the account to be moved to First Order.\nThe automation for new accounts in the system means accounts with under 500 employees but over 100 potential users will be routed to territory and left there unless they have no activity at the quarter change over.\nIf it is found out that an AE intentionally ignores rules number 1 or 2 more than twice in a fiscal year disciplinary action is likely to be taken.\nCo-Selling\nCo-selling is the responsibility of both the Account Executive and their Area Sales Manager to join sales calls together. This is to ensure the best client/prospect experience, along with jointly finding the highest potential within that account.\nArea Sales Managers have an expectation to log a minimum of 5 co-selling calls per rolling 7 days, although we are aiming to achieve closer to 10-12 calls over a rolling 7 days.\nCo-Selling Roles when working with your ASM\nPrimary Seller: Consider this role as the main pitch person. You are directing the conversation, sharing the deck and taking live notes and adding value, while also keeping on track with the agenda decided upon.\nCo-Seller: This individual is responsible for raw notes in Salesforce, time management, and digging into comments to identify areas where we should be finding additional information. The Co-pilot should be digging into levels and amounts of pain when the Pilot moves on without capturing this.\nFor additional information please visit this\nreinforcement module\nWorking with Channel Partners\nThe GitLab partner network is ready to work with GitLab Account Executive’s in order to extend the customer selling and services capacity offered by Commercial Sales. Channel’s approach to this is called Partner Co-selling and working with Partners involves building a simple, clear, mutual customer opportunity plan establishing “who will do what, when?”.\nWhat are the key benefits from working with partners?\nAEs Working with Partners for Increased Customer Value & Net ARR\nExtended reach and capabilities via Partner sales and services capacity and reach via GitLab-trained Partner AE’s, SA’s, Engineers, and often a GitLab channel manager to coordinate/assist.\nAccelerated reach to new customer logos “\nLand\n”: Partners are beginning to bring GitLab new logo opportunities via mining their customer base. In many cases, Partners already have a “trusted Partner status” with their customers, which also serves to accelerate new logo engagements.\nIncreased customer “\nExpand\n” success: In many cases, Partners will sell and deliver the key services called for to ensure customers get the maximum value from their GitLab technology investment and drive stage advance along with user growth.\nDeployment and related services: For faster delivery and increased capacity, AEs are turning to Partners to sell and deliver these services, also CSM-like customer success services.\nIn the case of OPEN partners via distributors, dramatic reduction in the admin steps associated with quote-to-order process.\nHow do AEs work with partners for increased customer value & Net ARR?\nGitLab has a mature Partner network with good coverage of GitLab-trained Sales and Technical resources. There are a few ways in which AEs will work with a customer including a Partner.\nApproved Partner GitLab Deal Registrations\nAs these are received in your territory, in most cases* you will be contacted by a GitLab channel team member to arrange a co-selling kickoff call to develop a simple Partner co-selling plan to share with the Partner. GitLab Channel Managers do not proactively manage all OPEN Partners. AEs can always request Channel Manager support for a Deal Registration by slacking channel-sales or available contacts.\nIf you find themselves thinking 1. “a Partner SA could execute on this customer-requested SA task”, or 2. AEs have customers that could benefit from a “Partner services attach engagement”, reach out on slack\n#channel-sales\nwith a Partner engagement request, if possible with a link to the related account or opportunity. A member of the channel team will promptly reach out to learn more about the request, and connect you with a Partner that is pre-qualified to promptly and properly execute on the task at hand, and keep you updated along the way.\nAEs should lead planning and execution of the joint opportunity/customer pursuit with alignment and support of the partner and GitLab Channel Manager. The plan should be\ntracked in SFDC with tasks and action items\n. Partners should always get an email confirmation of any tasks assigned to them (via AE or Channel Mgr).\nChannel Managers will engage with AE’s in the following ways:\nWhen a new deal registration arrives in the AE’s pipeline\nTo review 2-3 Partners for the AE to work with for AE-selected joint customer success motions:\nThe Channel Manager will bring the possibilities forward during this call\n2 examples of working with Partners are featured in\nthis LevelUp\nAEs should share their thoughts about prioritizing which Partner activities would be best for which of their customers\nIn the case of Open partners via distributions, when the opportunity is ready, AE’s email\npartnersupport@gitlab.com\nwith the link to the opportunity requesting quote-to-order support (chatter alias coming soon)\nResources to learn more about teaming with Channel Partners?\nIf this is a first time for an AE, we recommend watching the available training delivered.

The channel is closely monitored by several members of the channel team who are here to help AE’s succeed in co-selling in any way we can.\nList of\nGitLab-trained OPEN and SELECT channel partners\nChannel Partner Finder **\nHere\nNew Logo Team\nThe New Logo Team is a specialized sales team within GitLab’s High Velocity Sales & New Logo organization focused on closing first-order deals in MM & ENT accounts.\nAfter the first transaction is closed by the New Logo team, the New Logo AEs are responsible to kickstart the handover process. Below are the responsibilities of the New Logo team and the Mid-Market Key Account Named team.\nWhen to Pass an Account Mid-Market or Enterprise\nNew Logo AEs will own an account until an account becomes a paid customer. Once this happens, the account will graduate into their respective segment (SMB, MM, or ENT).\nHandover Process\nNew Logo AE Responsibilities\nPlease refer to the\nNew Logo Team Playbook\nfor additional information about the role and responsibilities.\nEnsure the opportunity is marked as ‘Closed-Won’.\nEnsure the customer has a working license.\nLog an activity (naming convention: [NL AE NAME] NL Account Summary for Handoff)  on the account level detailing the following:\nWhy the account chose GitLab (use case)\nThe expected NetARR to be sold in the next 12 months\nEstimated timeframe of the next purchase\nWhy you believe b and c to be the case\nWork with the Named or Territory AE, the CSM (if known), and the customer to set up a handoff call\nNew Logo AE should take the lead on scheduling this call\nNote\n: Should the NL Rep and Named or Territory AE agree ahead of time that an email introduction will suffice, then the team can bypass the handoff call.\nIf the initial amount AND the potential of the next opportunity are less than a combined NetARR of $10,000, or the inheriting AE agrees, a handoff email can be used.\nEnsure all material like custom decks are added into a dedicated customer sub-folder in the\nCustomers & Prospects\ndrive.\nCreate a sub-folder in one of the folders labeled A-Z based on the first letter of the customer account name. (Example: Acme Inc. would go in the folder labeled “A”)\nAdd all customer facing or internal documents related to that customer into the folder. This way the entire Account Team will be able to view all related content.\nFor Web Directs without prior engagement :There will be no handover as the FO AE has not had any engagement.\nDigital Sales Room\nA Digital Sales Room is a secure, personalized webpage where AEs can share curated content, collaborate with prospects, and track buyer engagement throughout the sales process. It centralizes all sales materials, presentations, and communications in one branded space, eliminating scattered emails and creating a seamless buyer experience.\nDigital Rooms - Highspot Overview Training\nDigital Rooms 101\nEngage Buyers with Digial Rooms\nNamed/Territory AE Responsibilities\nWork with the New Logo AE, CSM, and customer to schedule a handoff call (or email).\nThe goal should be to have two-way communication with the customer within one week of the initial close.\nIf an email is used, the Named or Territory AE should respond at their earliest convenience to introduce themselves as the new primary point of contact\nLook at the account activities for the activity logged by the FO AE.\nBased on the above notes, open a growth opportunity if scheduled before the first renewal date\nRead through all notes tagged (ii), the custom pitch deck, and the command plan to gain an understanding of the account and its potential.\nEngage the CSM on strategic accounts and get them engaged asap\nFor Web Directs: It is the responsibility of the Named/Territory AE to reach out to the new customer.\nProcess to Move Accounts From Base to Named/Territory\nPlease refer to the\nGo-To-Market Rules of Engagement\npage for additional information about account graduation for the New Logo Team.\nWhen to Consider Involving a Named or Territory AE Before the Initial Deal is Done\nThere may be situations where it is beneficial to either GitLab, the Prospect, or both to introduce the Named or Territory AE before the initial deal closes. These situations include, but are not limited to:\nExtra support is needed for a strategic account.\nA CSM may need to be engaged before the initial contract is signed.\nAn onsite meeting may need to happen and the Named/Territory AE is in a better geographical location to handle it.\nThe customer has asked to be introduced to who will handle their account after the initial contract is signed.\nGeneral Guidelines to Follow When Making this Consideration\nIt is always the decision of the New Logo AE to determine if an introduction should be made pre-contract signature, but there are some general best practices to follow if an introduction is to be made.\nIdeally, pre-contract introductions would be limited to higher LAM accounts, so this does not become a scale issue.\n99 LAMDev for Key Accounts\n->49 LAMDev for Territory Accounts\nIn an effort to not waste Named/Territory AEs time, an introduction should not be made unless there is a very high close percentage. Therefore, an introduction is best if made when the opportunity is in\nstage 5 or 6\n.\nNamed/Territory AEs and New Logo AEs should meet often (every other week on average) to identify accounts where a pre-contract introduction would make sense.\nCommercial Leadership Development Pilot Program\nThis pilot program is for Commercial team members interested in learning more about Sales management and building foundational leadership skills.\nThis program is designed to give team members:\nExposure to leadership topics and development of foundational leadership skills\nLeadership frameworks that they can modify and apply to their teams\nExperience with the expectations of a sales leader and how that differs from an individual contributor role\nOpportunity to network with peers and other cross functional stakeholders\nThe program will run for a total of\n8\nweeks;  each week focusing on a new topic. See the proposed topics by week for the pilot program:\nWeek\nTopic\nDescription\n1\nLeading People\nPrimary differences between being an individual contributor and a leader, establishing a V2MOM for your newly created team, building an inclusive culture, situational leadership, coaching model, establishing expectations for success and the cadence of events to drive consistent results on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis\n2\nRunning Effective 1 on 1s\nCore components for every meeting, how to capture and provide feedback from activities during the week, building consistency in performance through consistent accountability in one on one.\n3\nA Leaders Responsibility on Sales Calls\nStructure of an effective pre-call meeting, what roles a leader should focus on during the sales call, expected follow up for coaching and delivering results\n4\nRunning Effective Team Meetings\nKey components to a great team meeting - recognition, training, results, pipeline creation and current events.
