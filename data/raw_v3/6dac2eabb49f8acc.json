We have four key objectives monitored in the following ways:\nStrategic partnerships with business stakeholders - meet on a quarterly basis to review new or renewing third party spend and supplier management opportunities\nMetric(s): Supplier segmentation tiers\nAchieving annual cost avoidance (soft) savings and year over year (hard) savings\nMetric(s):\nSoft Savings\n(cost avoidance) is mitigating proposed cost increases or any negotiations for new purchases.\nHard Savings\n(year over year) is a decrease in cost from last year and is only valid for renewals. This can include decreasing unit costs, removing users and/or scaling back services and scope\nThird party risk management\nand ensuring we are getting the best commercial terms with the least amount of risk for GitLab\nMetric(s): the number of active and new vendors each quarter, and reported and monitored via internal and external audit\nResponsible sourcing/purchasing and supplier diversity - managed through the Zip and Coupa onboarding and purchasing process\nMetric(s):\nZip SLAs\nand diverse suppliers\nVendor Lifecycle Management\nThe Procurement team is responsible for ensuring there is a process for suppliers to be managed throughout their lifecycle of doing business with GitLab from initial selection and contracting to recurring reviews and renewals to cancellation.\n1. RFP and Vendor Selection\nAll new spend, changing of vendors for existing services, and market reviews every 3 years for existing contracts should follow the\nRFP and Vendor Selection process\n, unless approved by your Procurement Category Manager, to ensure we are choosing the best partner for GitLab with the best commercial terms. This must be done prior to verbally agreeing to terms or contracting with any new or existing vendor.\nFollow the RFP process outlined in the\ninternal handbook\n. You will find resources and templates for RFP events at any level, whether it is a quick bid or a full procurement-led RFP with 5+ vendors. Always reach out to your Procurement Cateogry Manager to notify them that an RFP is being conducted- they can assist in the process and can answer any questions.\nAs part of this process, create an issue with the\nRFP Intake template\nand tag your\nCategory Manager\n.\nBefore sharing details and/or confidential information regarding GitLab business needs, obtain a\nMutual Non-Disclosure Agreement\nfrom the potential vendor(s). Refer to the\nSignature Authorization Matrix\nfor signing authority.\nAll vendors must adhere to the\nGitLab Partner Code of Ethics\n. It is mandatory all vendors contractually adhere to this if they would like to do business with us. (Note these are typically not required in event related agreements unless the vendor is providing services).\n2. Negotiation, Privacy, Security, and Compliance Review\nDepending on the amount of spend, Procurement will assist or lead in negotiating the pricing and commercial terms of the contract.\nDepending on the types of data shared with the vendor, Privacy and Security will need to complete a review of the vendor. Depending on nature of vendor’s services and/or whether the vendor has been recommended to us, the Ethics and Compliance team will need to complete an anticorruption/antibribery review and, potentially, recommend additional measures to mitigate that risk.\nFor more information on these requirements and steps, see the\nReview Steps, Timeline, and Considerations section\n3. Contracting\nAll work that is done with a vendor must have a completed contract to be compliant and work may not be started until a contract is in place. Contracts include\nNDAs\n, Master Service Agreements and Statements of Works. Our legal team assists with this step in the process. Please see the\nlegal review process\nfor more details.\nAdditionally, please note that a small number of team members can sign agreements on behalf of GitLab - please see the\nAuthorization Matrix\nfor more details.\n4. Vendor Onboarding\nIn order for vendors to be paid, they need to complete their onboarding in our systems. Please see the\nNew Vendor Onboarding\nsection for more details.\n5. Recurring Vendor Reviews and Management\nProcurement will work with you through the Quarterly Procurement & Business Spotlights to review upcoming renewals and cancellations, new spend projects, and identifying\nvendor’s segmentation tier:\nStrategic, Niche, Commodity, or Transactional.\nIdentifying the Segmentation Tier your supplier(s) falls within helps determine the right vendor management approach, e.g. renew the contract, RFP, business reviews on a recurring cadence, continuous improvement plans, etc.\nIf holding a business review with a vendor, the following topics should be discussed:\nSuccess criteria of the contract\nWhat is going well\nWhat can be improved\nReview of any issues and remediation expected\nOverview of the contract and its utilization\nVendor Renewals\nOn a quarterly basis, the Procurement team will meet with business stakeholders in each department to review a rolling 12 month list of renewals, focusing on the upcoming 2 quarters. This list is pulled from Zip and Coupa. The list should be reviewed and prioritized with the business owners. The renewal process should start at least 90 days ahead of the renewal date providing ample time to review the terms and decide:\nAre there any additional security requirements for the vendor?\nHas our sanctions screening tool, Risk Rate, detected any potential matches since the vendor was originally onboarded?\nHas the anticorruption risk profile changed?\nHas the vendor had an RFP for pricing in last 3 years?\nDo we want to terminate or reduce spend and need to proactively notify per the contract?\nDo we want to change any terms of our contract?\n6. Cancellation\nThe following methods will be used to capture cancellations (which include terminations and/or non-renewals):\nAutomated Notice:\nThe DRI for the purchased item will receive notification of an upcoming renewal;\nProcurement Led:\nThe Procurement Team will review upcoming renewals, and active purchases, during the quarterly “Category Spotlight” meetings.\nDRI Led:\nDRI’s and other stakeholders may determine that products, events and/or services are no longer needed.\nFor each of the above, if a cancellation is desired (which include terminations and/or non-renewals) please follow the “Cancellation Process” outlined below:\nSubmit a\nTermination/Non-Renewal Request\nthrough Zip by completing the intake form and providing copies of the existing contract(s) that you are canceling.\nThrough Zip, Procurement and Legal will work with the requester to provide instructions on how, when, and who should notify the vendor. For most non-renewal notices, the business owner will notify the vendor via Legal’s guidance.\nSecurity and Privacy will also be added for awareness and review if data is being shared with the vendor to determine the requirements of returning or deleting the data.\nFor certain cancellation requests, like Software for example, IT will be included in the Zip workflow to determine and complete the proper deprovisioning and system offboarding requirements. This includes\nremoval of the system\nfrom our\nTech Stack\n.\nIf necessary, the requester and/or business owner will need to create and execute on a communication plan to notify all or impacted team members of the cancellation.\nUpcoming terminations/non-renewals should be discussed with Procurement during the Quarterly Category Spotlight meetings that Procurement holds with category leads/budget owners. As Procurement is made aware of upcoming cancellations during these meetings, Procurement will review on a quarterly basis any known cancellations with Legal to ensure notification requirements are met. Procurement and Legal will then work with the business owner on completing the above process. If a cancellation is determined outside of this quarterly cadence, notify your Procurement Category Manager and complete the above process as soon as possible.\nThe Procurement Process\nAnytime a group of suppliers are being evaluated for services/goods or a purchase is being made on behalf of GitLab that does not qualify as a\npersonal expense\nor meet the list of\nexceptions\n, Procurement must be engaged BEFORE a purchase and/or work can begin. Start the Procurement Process\nBefore agreeing to any business, legal and/or pricing terms with a supplier, whether in conversation or email\nImmediately when you receive a contract and/or quote for new and/or recurring business\nIf you have received a contract from a supplier, tell them you will send to your procurement team for review\nWhen evaluating a group of suppliers and/or starting the\nRFP Process\n.\nIf unsure where or when to begin, tag the @procurement_team in the #procurement slack channel for support. You can also reach out to your\nProcurement Category Manager\ndirectly.\nHow to start the Procurement Process\nMajority of the Procurement Process lives within our Procurement system called Zip. You can access Zip via your\nOkta home page\n, or if you need Zip access,\nsubmit an access request here\n.\nFor more Zip training materials, review the\nZip End Users Guide\nand the\nTips for Submitting a Zip Request page\n.\nDepending on a few factors of your purchase, there are different ways to engage Procurement and start the Procurement process:\nSubmit a Zip Request for\nPurchase Requests for renewals of existing vendor’s services\nPurchase Requests for new spend\nunder $25k\nChange Requests to existing POs\n$0 contract reviews including demos and trials\nPartner Revenue Payments\nIndividual Use Software\nProviding Termination or Non-Renewal Notice\nFor new spend, changing vendors for existing services, or after 3 years of renewing a service, follow the\nRFP Process\nOver $250K: Procurement led RFP, typically 5+ vendor bids\n$100K - $250K: Business led RFP, 2-3 vendor bids required\n$25K - $100K: Business led quick-bid, 2 vendor bids required\nUnder $25K: no bid required\nHiring a Contingent Worker?\nIf you’re hiring a contingent worker, please read GitLab’s\nContingent Worker Policy\n, which provides comprehensive guidelines on engaging with different types of contingent workers. The policy outlines three main categories: Staff Augmentation Workers (agency-provided temporary resources), Consultancy Services (third-party professional services), and Independent Contractors (used by exception only). You’ll find detailed information about each worker type’s characteristics, duration limits, country hiring guidelines, contractor extension processes, and background screening requirements. This policy is designed to help team members understand when and how to properly engage contingent workers while mitigating classification risks.\nNote: For subcontractors for the Professional Services team, please use the process for Revenue Partner Payments.\nReview Steps, Timeline, and Considerations\nRequests can take 5 days to 3+ weeks for processing depending on a number of factors that will impact the time for review of a Purchase Request including, but not limited to:\nNew or existing vendor\nIf negotiation is required\nTypes of data being shared with the vendor and if Security and Privacy need to review\nContract complexity and alignment with GitLab’s\nVendor Terms and Conditions\nVendor’s response time and willingness to negotiate\nEach review’s targeted approval time is outlined below, but as mentioned above, this is dependent on many factors and the accuracy and completeness of information provided by the requester. If your request meets any of the additional approval criterias outlined below, please plan accordingly and submit your Zip request allowing each cross-functional team enough time to complete their review. Please follow the\nsteps outlined for urgent requests\nthat cannot meet the below timeline and have specific and quantifiable impact to the business.\n1. Sanctions Screening (Ethics & Compliance): 30 minutes - 3+ Days, if required\nUse the vendor’s complete name in your Zip request, as this will be the basis for sanctions screening which automatically happens in our sanctions screening tool, Risk Rate. Incomplete names (e.g., “EY Germany” rather than “Ernst and Young GmbH”) may result in false positives and unnecessary delay.\nIf Risk Rate detects no matches between the vendor and applicable sanctions lists AND the vendor is not located in a high-risk country, the vendor will be auto-approved. If Risk Rate detects a potential match or is located in a high risk country, the vendor may require escalation to and manual review by GitLab’s Trade Compliance Counsel.\nInclude the vendor’s website or LinkedIn page in the relevant Zip field, in advance, to help counsel evaluate the match more quickly.\n2.A. Buyer Review (Procurement): 2 days\nEnsure you have the appropriate contract documents uploaded when you submit your request\nThe $ amount of the req matches the contract value and the correct billing codes are selected\n2.B. New Supplier Onboarding: 2-3+ Days, if required\nThis is entirely dependent upon the suppliers response time.\nOnce supplier information has been submitted in Zip and the Procurement team sets the vendor up in Coupa, the supplier receives an email from Coupa requesting banking and tax information to facilitate payment.\nThe Procurement team cannot complete this on the supplier’s behalf since we do not know this information. If we did, it would be a violation of SOX Compliance guidelines.\nIf your supplier isn’t onboarded after 2 days, contact your supplier directly requesting they do so ASAP since their contract cannot be reviewed or approved until this is completed. Carbon copy\nprocurement@gitlab.com\n3.A. FP&A Review: 2 days\nFP&A is included as an initial reviewer to ensure the requested spend is within budget and that the Billing Code entered in Zip is correct so it can be pushed to Coupa when ready for final approvals.\n3.B. IT Review: 2 days if purchasing new software or for contractors\nRequester should have vendor complete the\nIT New Software Questionnaire\nand submit with the purchase request so IT can complete their review\n4.A. Legal Review: 3 to 21 days\nThe amount of time for review and reaching execution is based on the details below. Use these SLAs as guidelines, noting that each contract review is unique. If additional terms, requirements, and/or risks are identified, the timeline may be extended. The ability for GitLab to work efficiently through an agreement negotiation relies on the vendor and their counsel responding promptly to GitLab redlines and comments. Delays from the supplier will delay approval.\nTypes of Vendors and Review Times\nExisting vendors for renewals or upsells: 3-5 days\nExisting vendors generally require much less time as existing terms are in place which will underline the products and/or services being offered. That said, in the event GitLab is adding a new product and/or service, additional cycles may be required in order to amend the existing agreement.\n⚠️ You must either upload all complete contract terms (including attachments and amendments) or provide a direct link to an existing agreement. Indicate which sections cover your current request. For example, “See existing Master Service Agreement with Vendor XYZ (Zip req #67890), Amendment #3 covers the new software modules we’re requesting”. Do\nnot\nprovide general references like “covered under existing agreement with vendor” or assume legal can locate terms without guidance.\nNew vendors: 1-3+ weeks\nNew vendors require the most amount of time as GitLab will be establishing terms and conditions for the first time, which will govern the use of the products and/or services being procured.\nAll contract documents must be provided in Word (.docx) format in English.\nPDF versions are not acceptable for legal review as they cannot be efficiently redlined. Contact the vendor to request the Word version before submitting your request.\nNegotiations can vary from 1 week to multiple months based on the level of detail and modifications required to reach executable terms.\nIf vendor doesn’t readily accept the\nGitLab standard terms\n, additional rounds of redlines and negotiations may be required, extending this SLA.\nWhenever possible, the legal team hopes to achieve redlines provided back to the vendor no less than five (5) business days after being assigned.\nTypes of Agreements\nSoftware (SaaS & On-Prem):\nRequires the most rigorous review to ensure the rights and obligations placed upon GitLab are, (i) reasonable given the software being provided, and (ii) align with GitLab contracting and industry standards.\nProfessional Services / Training:\nRequires detailed review to ensure intellectual property ownership aligns with our intentions, and reasonable obligations being placed upon GitLab.\nMarketing / Events:\nGenerally, requires the least amount of time to review as the obligations are standardized given the event in question and program provided. Details regarding events may include negotiations with regards to Force Majeure, cancellation (including penalty), and ensuring the terms align with those of the requesting GitLab team members.\nData Processing Agreement (DPA)/Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):\nRequired when personal data is shared with, accesssed, or collected by the supplier on behalf of GitLab. DPA/SCCs are generally affixed to an agreement but may be required as a separate agreement upon the determination of Privacy (see the Privacy review process below).\nNegotiation, Security, Privacy, and PeopleOps reviews are only required if the purchase request meets certain criteria, as described below. In the event two or more of these activities are required, they will happen in parallel to one another and Legal’s review.\n4.B. Negotiation: 12 days\nThe Procurement team negotiates SaaS contracts >$25k and one-time contracts >$100K\nIf this step is not taken, purchase orders will not be approved until Procurement is able to negotiate\nSLA can extend based on level of negotiation required for large and/or complex contracts, and the suppliers willingness to meet budget and benchmark indicators. For larger spend purchases, it is beneficial to engage Procurement prior to submitting the request in Zip so negotiations can start earlier.\nFor communicating Legal’s redlines to the vendor,\nIf the contract value is >$100k or Procurement is already actively negotiating or communicating with the vendor, Procurement will take responsibility for sending any legal redlines to the vendor. Procurement will comment in the req if/when they have sent redlines to the vendor for visibility. Otherwise the Stakeholder/Requester will be responsible.\nReview here for more details on when and who is responsible\n4.C. Security Review: 4-14 Days\nSecurity Third Party Risk Management\nreviews are required for vendors that collect, process, or store Orange / Red Data, software providers (SaaS and On-premise), and independent contractors / consultants. (Excluding field marketing events)\nThis activity cannot begin until\nafter\nthe supplier completes the security questionnaire and supplies their security documentation. Oftentimes, it can take 1-2 weeks for the supplier to respond and complete the requested materials. The security review SLA begins once that is completed. Time before this activity can begin is entirely dependent upon the supplier’s response time and maturity of security protocols.\nTIP:\nTo increase speed of approval, upload any security compliance documentation (SOC-2 Report, ISO27001 Certificate) to the ZipHQ Request and notify your supplier contact they will be receiving a request from GitLab’s Security Risk Team for completion ASAP.\nFor any inquiries and questions, please tag @securityrisk in the #procurement slack channel.\n4.D. Compliance Review: 4-14 Days\nThe first page of the Zip request includes anticorruption gating question (e.g., will the vendor interact with government agencies on our behalf, was this vendor recommended by a government official, etc.). If the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” the Ethics & Compliance team must consider whether the vendor presents unacceptably high compliance risk.\nTo do this, the Ethics & Compliance team will conduct additional due diligence, which may, in part, consist of sending a questionnaire directly to the vendor. This questionnaire asks about the vendor’s ownership and history with applicable regulatory agencies, to better understand the risk, and asks whether the vendor has an anticorruption program in place, to understand whether the vendor has already taken measures to mitigate that risk. Turnaround time largely depends on the vendor’s responsiveness.\nWhen risk is present, the Ethics & Compliance team will consider whether anything can be done to mitigate that risk. Risk mitigation could, for example, consist of additional provisions in the vendor agreement.\n4.E. PeopleOps Review: 1-4 Days\nPeopleOps serve as reviewers on all professional services requisitions to determine if a background screening is necessary.\nPer GitLab’s\nPeople Policies\ncontractors are subject to complete a background screening. GitLab will accept a completed background screening from a contractor’s employer. However, if a background screening was never conducted GitLab will either complete one or ask that one be completed.\nA background screening can be requested by opening an issue in the\nLifecycle Management\nproject by using the\nbackground_check_request\ntemplate.\nApproval will occur once proof of a completed or an initiated background screening has been shared or once the contractor has submitted their background screening for processing.\nThe Sr. Background Check Specialist will only follow up if a result of concern returns on the background screening.\nQuestions and/or proof regarding background screenings on professional service requisitions in Zip can be sent to\nbackgroundchecks@gitlab.com\n.\n4.F. Privacy Review: 4-14 Days\nA Privacy Review is required for all SaaS purchases and other purchase types where the supplier will receive from GitLab or collect on GitLab’s behalf red/orange data. For existing vendors, a full privacy review is required every 24 months, provided the vendor completed a full and satisfactory privacy review during the prior procurement cycle\nThis activity begins\nafter\nthe supplier completes a Privacy and Trade Compliance Assessment form and a Transfer Impact Assessment Form (where personal data is transferred from the EU to the U.S.) Oftentimes, it can take a week for the supplier to respond and complete the requested forms. The SLA begins once that is completed.\nTime before this activity can begin is entirely dependent upon the supplier’s response time and whether a DPA/SCCs are required.\nA DPA/SCCs are often made part of the agreement with the supplier. Generally, Privacy would prefer to use our DPA/SCCs but if the supplier provides their DPA/SCCs as an exhibit to the main agreement, Legal and Privacy may use the supplier’s version to arrive at a final agreed upon version. Procurement will obtain executed versions of DPA/SCCs in the Final Buyer Review stage.\nTIP:\nTo increase speed of approval, add a link to the suppliers privacy notice; upload the suppliers Transfer Impact Assessment Guide; and upload a word version of their DPA/SCCs if the supplier requuests us to use their version.\n5. Final Buyer Review and Coupa Req Creation: 2 days\nProcurement completes a final check that all information is accurate and agreement(s) have been stamped before creating the req in Coupa for final approvals.\n6. Coupa Approvals and Execute Contract: 4 days\nAt this point, the req has been created in Coupa for final FP&A, Functional, and Executive approvals (as applicable).\nOnce these approvals are received, Procurement will route the contract for GitLab and vendor signatures and will comment in the Coupa req when it is routing. After both parties have signed the Agreement(s), Procurement will attach a copy of the executed agreement in Coupa, approve the Purchase Req, and release the PO.\nNote: only certain GitLab team members can sign contracts based on the\nAuthorization Matrix\nTo see how to check approval status in Coupa, visit the\nZip End Users Guide\n.\nNote: the completion of this step is dependent on how quickly the required approvers approve in Coupa and the contract is signed\n7. Finalize Request Details\nYour purchase req has been approved! The supplier will receive a copy of the PO and a communication from Coupa indicating how to submit invoices, one of two ways:\nDirectly in their Coupa portal (preffered)\nSending invoices to\nap@gitlab.com\nwith the PO number included on the invoice\nFailure to follow these instructions will delay payment and invoices uploaded to Coupa by a GitLab team member are not routed for payment.\nDuring this approval step, Procurement is finalizing any request details, such as final contract term dates based on signature effective date, and setting up Zip renewal alerts for the request if needed.\nSince the contract has been signed and PO is released at this point, you may now begin work and/or obtaining services from the supplier.\nWhat if I have an Urgent Request?\nIf you are unable to plan and have a legitimate reason to escalate a purchase request, follow the process below.\nPost in #procurement slack channel request for escalation with:\nLink to your Zip Request\nDate needed\nSpecific and quantifiable impact to the business if date is missed.\n“Supplier wants it signed today” does not qualify as a reason for escalation and these requests will be denied.\n“Price will increase $45K if not signed by Friday” or “Material negative brand impact if not signed by Friday due to missed PR deadlines” are specific, tangible, business impacts that will be reviewed.\nTruly urgent and business critical requests will be evaluated, please note these are disruptive to our workflow and our ability to meet SLA’s for requests opened on time.\nWe may or may not be able to accommodate your urgent request based on the risk and bandwidth available.\nWhen you know you have a critical request with a deadline, enter the request into Zip 1-2 weeks prior to standard approval times to avoid needing escalation. Do this even if the contract isn’t final yet to help expedite the process.\nWhat are the exceptions to the PO Policy?\nExceptions to the PO Policy are:\nOne time purchases under $5K (or less than $5K annually)\nCharitable Contributions (Donations)\nInterview Candidate Reimbursement\nConfidential outside counsel legal fees\nStatutory Tax fees\nPEO Providers\nAR/Customer Refunds\nBoard of Director Payments\nFinancing, Banking and Investing (incl interest, debt, FX, fees)\nCorporate Credit Card\nUrgent Payments not included on list above (approval required from VP, Corporate Controller and/or PAO)\nThird Party Risk Management\nThe procurement team from a compliance and risk perspective has developed a process to handle third party risk to reduce the risk of the following:\nFinancial Fraud or exposure created by third party behavior such as:\nData leakage\nSecurity breach\nBusiness continuity\nEtc.\nFailure of financial viability of third party impacting delivery\nReputational damage arising from third party behavior\nBreach of regulation or law through third party action\nDisruption in customer service due to third parties\nWhen do we require a financial viability check?\nWhen any of the following is met:\nVendor is a private company, LLC or self-employed\nServices provided are required for continued operations\nCloud hosting services\nServices directly related to servicing customers with an uptime requirement\nStorage of data that is not recoverable if vendor goes out of business\nSoftware or services where it would take over 1 week to replace or swap\nHow do we ensure terms to establish GitLab (and our Vendors) rights and responsibilities?\nAny time GitLab engages with a third party for the procurement of goods and/or services, which require GitLab to engage in a contract, the GitLab Legal Procurement team will review the terms and conditions. The purpose of this team is to review the contract which GitLab will enter into, and ensure the following:\nTerms and conditions which are fair and reasonable given the type(s) of products and/or services being procured; and\nAdequate obligations on behalf of GitLab vendors to ensure compliance with\nGitLab’s Code of Conduct and other company policies,\napplicable laws, rules and regulations (including protection of personal data), and\nthe delivery, support and provision of goods and/or services\nIn addition to ensuring terms and conditions, the GitLab Legal Procurement team collaborates frequently with procurement and business stakeholders to ensure any (and all) contracts align with the needs of the team. The GitLab Legal Procurement team addresses the needs of stakeholders ranging from complex technical application and platform services, to creating and drafting event contracts to meet the needs of GitLab events.\nHow do we prevent disruption in customer service?\nAs GitLab does with its own customers, agreements with third parties include obligations that vendors have to GitLab. These can include, but are not limited to:\nUptime / downtime commitments (for SaaS providers)\nSLAs (for support)\nTermination rights\nAnd other commercial contract provisions which would enable GitLab to seek relief in the event of disruption\nLarge Internal Events Process\nFor any large internal events with a total cost greater than $1M, such as SKO, President’s Club, Commit, etc, the following should be completed before any contracts are executed or any work is conducted.\nThe planning stages for events of this size should be completed at least 18-24 months prior to the actual event. This allows for ample time to get the necessary internal approvals, run any RFPs needed, and book large hotel blocks or buyouts.\nConnect with your Procurement Category Manager and FP&A Business Partner to determine the various vendors needed to run the event and line item detail in the total event budget. This would include lodging, food & beverage, event planning, on-site support, excursions, travel, etc.\nDetermine with your Procurement contact how these vendors will be selected and the timeline to run any necessary\nRFPs\n. RFPs should be conducted at least 20 months prior to the event dates.\nUpon completion of RFPs, the top 2-3 location options and their total pricing will be presented to the E Group DRI (CRO/CMO) and VP of Finance to determine the preferred location choice and corresponding budget. All information should be summarized in an issue where these approvals may be documented.\nOnce preferred location and budget are tentatively chosen, this information will be presented to the CFO for approval, and will then be presented to the Board for approval at their quarterly meeting, or via email as necessary. Please note that Board approvals may take multiple weeks. CFO and Board approvals should be obtained no less than 18 months prior to the event dates.\nAfter all executive approvals are received, the Zip request(s) should be created to document official approvals, obtain signatures on contracts, and release PO(s).\nHelpful Documents and Templates\nContract Templates\nGitLab Vendor Terms and Conditions\nLogo Authorization Template\nData Processing Addendum (unlocked for editing)\nEU Standard Contractual Clauses\nUS Contractor Agreement\nSOW Template\nChange Request Template\nDocumentation\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Process\nCertificate of Insurance Request Process\nUploading Third Party Contracts to ContractWorks\nCompany Information\n- general information about each legal entity of the company\nTrademark\n- information regarding the usage of GitLab’s trademark\nAuthorization Matrix\n- the authority matrix for spending and binding the company and the process for signing legal documents\nOther Services\nHome Office and Supplies\nIndividual Use Software\nRFP and Vendor Selection Process\nVendor Terms and Conditions\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)\nCharitable Contributions\nNon-Cost Related Agreements (Including Trials/Demos)\nCharitable Contribution Requests\nIf you have a request to donate GitLab funds to a charitable cause, please refer to the Philanthropy …\nContingent Worker Policy\n1.
