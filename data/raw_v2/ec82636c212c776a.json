the groupings\ndefined on our\nteam structure page\n.\nManagers of One\nIn an all-remote organization, we want each team member to be a\nmanager of one\n. A\nmanager of one\nis an attribute associated with our\nEfficiency value\n. To be successful at GitLab, team members need to develop their daily priorities to achieve goals. Managers of one set the tone for their work, assign items and determine what needs to get done. No matter what role you serve, self-leadership is an essential skill needed to be successful as a manager of one.\nAt GitLab, leadership is requested from everyone, whether an individual contributor or member of the leadership team.\nAs a leader, GitLab team members will follow your behavior, so always do the right thing. Lead by example with effort.\nEveryone who joins GitLab should consider themselves ambassadors of our\nvalues\nand protectors of our\nculture\n.\nBehavior should be consistent inside and outside the company. We do the right thing outside the company, too.\nGitLab respects your judgment of what is best for you, since you know yourself best. If you have a better opportunity somewhere else don’t stay at GitLab out of a sense of loyalty to the company.\nIn tough times people will put in their best effort when they are doing it for each other.\nWe work\nasynchronously\n. Lead by example and make sure people understand that\nthings need to be written down in issues as they happen\n. Hold your team accountable with documentation.\nWe are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions, but in the end\none person decides\nthe matter after they have listened to all the feedback.\nIt is encouraged to disagree and have constructive debates but please\nargue intelligently\n.\nWe value truth seeking over cohesion.\nWe avoid\nmeetings\n, when possible, because they don’t support the asynchronous work flow and are hard to conduct due to timezone differences.\nStart meetings on time, be on time yourself, don’t ask if everyone is there, and don’t punish people that have shown up on time by waiting for people or repeating things for those that come late. When a meeting unblocks a process or decision, don’t celebrate that but instead address the question: How can we unblock in the future without needing a meeting?\nBe intentional in how you prepare for and participate in meetings. Async communication works best when folks\nreview their calendars and prepare in advance of meetings\n.\nWe give\nfeedback\n, lots of it. Don’t hold back on suggestions for improvements, this helps us grow. Take pride in helping others through feedback.\nFocus on improvement\n. If you meet external people, always ask what they think we should improve.\nFollowing from\nPaul Graham’s advice\n: Strive to make the organization simpler.\nSaying something to the effect of “as you might have heard”, “unless you’ve been living in a cage you know”, “as everyone knows”, or “as you might know” is toxic. The people that know don’t need it to be said. The people that don’t know feel like they missed something and might be afraid to ask about the context.\nDon’t use someone else’s name\n, remind people of your title, or otherwise\n“pull rank”\nto get things done.\nAct as a CEO of yourself and your role by taking responsibility to set goals and appropriate timelines. Prioritize your contributions and know it’s\nimpossible to know everything\n.\nCommunicate clearly with your team and people leader on the status of your goals. Act quickly to address areas that pose a challenge or to reassess goals that cannot be reached in an alloted timeframe.\nExamples of actions from managers of one at GitLab\nWhen asked to attend a synchronous brainstorming call, a team member instead opens an issue and\nrequests for their team’s ideas asynchronously\n.\nA people leader champions our value of\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\nby\nbecoming a mentor\n.\nA team member blocks out dedicated time for learning and development to implement a regular practice of\nself-serving and self-learning\n.\nA team member in a new role finds an inefficiency in a process they are learning. Without being asked or supervised, they open a merge request (MR) proposing a change and assign it to their manager for review.\nWhen a scheduled meeting agenda is complete 10 minutes before the call is set to end, an attendee ends the call early.\nA people leader hires a new team member that demonstrates our\nCREDIT values\n.\nBefore asking for others’ time to discuss a topic, they dedicate time to process their thoughts and\nmake a proposal\n.\nA manager of one prioritizes well-being by blocking their calendars for fitness, meals,\npaid time off\n, and personal appointments.\nA team member surfaces blockers as opposed to assuming their manager or team is already aware, and simultaneously works to unblock others by\nworking in public\nand with a\nlow level of shame\n.\nInterim and Acting Leadership\nIn some cases, a individual in the\nManagement group\n,\nDirector group\n,\nS-group\n, or even\nE-group\nmay have an “Interim” or “Acting” title.\nActing\nmeans that someone is occupying this role temporarily and will move back to their original role after a set amount of time or other conditions, such as an external hire.\nInterim\nmeans the individual is working on a promotion into the role.\nIn either case, they will be fulfilling the full responsibilities of the role. If you have any questions, about the future of the role, please ask them or their manager.\nIndividual departments will have their own criteria for who is eligible to occupy these roles, so please check the career development page for your department.\nMaking decisions\nPlease see the\nMaking Decisions\nLeadership page.\nCommunication should be direct, not hierarchical\nMost companies communicate from top to bottom through a chain of command. This communication flow often empowers managers, but it also introduces inefficiency as team members are not able to connect directly with the people they need to communicate with in order to get their work done. At GitLab, every team member is encouraged to reach out to whoever is the correct person (or people) to quickly unblock issues, solve problems or support in other ways. Do be courteous of your direct manager and copy them on the request. We don’t encourage unnecessary friction in asking team members to escalate through managers and wait for responses to come back. What matters is efficiency in getting to results. Slack the CEO, Slack a VP, or Slack a peer. Do what you need to do to make GitLab successful.\nManagers should not be bottlenecks or silos for communication.\nAnyone should feel\ncomfortable\nreaching out to anyone else with the best information they can to solve a problem.\nThis is a more\nefficient\n,\ntransparent\n, and\ncollaborative\nway to work.\nGiving Feedback\nGiving regular\nfeedback\nis extremely important for both managers and team members. Feedback can take the form of coaching sessions, separate from\n1-to-1 meetings\n. Giving feedback is also about being prepared and, depending on the situation, you should create separate agendas and structure them as follows:\nProvide\ncontext\n.\nUse a framework for your feedback. Our recommended framework is\nCrucial Conversations\n– we offer\na training course\n, and the book is part of our\nrecommended reading for leaders\n.\nAsk yourself, is this:\nActionable\nSpecific\nKind\n(Does the feedback help the person? Note: Being kind is not the same as being nice.)\nObjective (similar to Fair)\nRelevant to the job role and\ncompa ratio\nIdentifying root causes\nSometimes when performance dips, the best way to tackle it is to try to determine the root cause. This is easier said than done. There is a great tool that\nCEB (now Gartner)\ncreated to help with this called\nperformance issue root cause diagnostic\n. It may not always be possible or appropriate to determine the root cause, so the\nunderperformance process\nshould be followed.\nResponding to Negative Feedback\nAs a leader, the way you respond to negative\nfeedback\nmakes a significant impact\non your team. Remember that it can be difficult for people to approach someone\nin authority with concerns and respond with sensitivity and appreciation. In particular, we\nrecommend that you keep the following in mind:\nDon’t argue or get defensive. Accept the feedback for what it is: an attempt\nto help you improve your work or your professional relationships. If you do\nhave to explain yourself, try to remain empathetic.\nIt’s fine (even preferable) to defer action. When presented with negative\nfeedback, we often feel like we have to either justify our actions or promise\nchange, and since change isn’t always easy when you’re responsible for a\nlarge team, justification becomes the default. It’s OK to say you need time to\nevaluate the feedback and decide how to proceed.\nThe Right Way to Respond to Negative Feedback\nIf a team member from your department or another part of the org comes to you and says they do not feel like they or their reports’ contributions are valued by your reports, the manager should try to resolve this. Research shows that this is more likely to happen to underrepresented minorities. Please note that\nDRIs are free to ignore feedback\nwithout acknowledging it and that\nvaluing contributions isn’t the same as agreeing with them\n. This is about co-opting someone else’s idea without attribution and/or dismissing an idea with an ad-hominem remark.\n1-to-1\nPlease see\n1-1\n.\nSkip level interactions\nPlease see\nskip-levels\n.\nYour Individual README\nA team member’s README page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with them, especially people who haven’t worked with them before. It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share your ideas of a good working relationship, to reduce the anxiety of people who may be on your team, now or in the future.\nREADMEs provide a genuine report on how a person works, reducing bias/assumption and enabling people to work together based on a common framework. As part of GitLab’s\ntransparency\nvalue, we encourage each GitLab team member to consider creating their own README.\nREADMEs by Division\nGitLab division README pages are linked below for context. Reading other READMEs is an important way to get ideas on what you can include in yours. Let these serve as a guide and inspiration to you.\nEngineering READMEs\nMarketing Team READMEs\nProduct READMEs\nUX Department READMEs\nSales Team READMEs\nPeople Group READMEs\nFinance Team READMEs\nLegal Team READMEs\nOffice of the CEO READMEs\nCreating Your README\nCopy the\nREADME-template\nand paste into your favorite Markdown editor. If you do not have a Markdown editor,\nTypora\nand\nBear\nare recommended.\nFill out the recommended sections. Note that each section is\noptional\n. You can remove those you aren’t comfortable filling out, and add sections that are interesting or important to you.\nOnce complete, you’ll need to\ncreate an issue\nwith the Digital Experience team to add a page to GitLab’s website.\nIf your\ndivision\nalready\nhas a page to host READMEs (see above), follow the guidelines to\nadd a new page\nwithin that directory (e.g.\nDarren M.\n, a member of the marketing team, would add a new directory and page within\n/handbook/marketing/readmes\n, creating\n/handbook/marketing/readmes/dmurph\n)\nIf your\ndivision\ndoes not yet have a holding page for READMEs, follow the guidelines to\nadd a new page\n(\nreadmes\n) within your division’s handbook section\nfirst\n, then create your username directory within\nreadmes\n.\nBonus points if you add your README & yourselves as codeowner to the\n.gitlab/CODEOWNERS\nfile.\nAlternatively you can create your README\ndogfooding\nGitLab’s README profile customization feature. Follow\ndocumentation\non how to add details to your GitLab profile with a README. Do not forget to add your profile’s link to you division’s holding page.\nAdvertising Your README\nOnce your README is created, consider adding a link to it from following places:\nGoogle Doc agendas or calendar invites\nYour GitLab.com profile\nYour Slack profile\nYour Email signature\nThis provides maximum visibility to others, so that they may read your README in advance of working with you. This allows them to take your working style and communication preferences into account, ideally increasing the overall level of empathy expressed.\nREADMEs are particularly powerful when working with those\noutside\nof GitLab, who may be unfamiliar with our\nvalues\n. A README is a beacon of\ntransparency\n, and helps set the tone for any working relationship.\nCoaching\nWhat is coaching?\nCoaching\nis about helping others help themselves. It is not about giving advice, instruction, or telling someone what to do.\nCoaching is about focusing on the future and identifying where the coachee wants to be and what they want to achieve.\nAt GitLab, we’ve defined coaching as a conversation that helps people think for themselves, find their own answers, and commit to action they design. As a coach, your role is to clarify the pathway from the current state to the future. Coaches do this by enabling the coachee to make informed choices based on deeper insight.\nNo matrix organization\nPlease see\nno-matrix-organization\nStable counterparts\nWe want to promote organic cross-functional collaboration by giving people stable counterparts for other functions they need to work with. For example, each Strategic Account Executive (SAE) works with one Sales Development Representative (SDR). With our\ncategories\nevery backend team of developers maps to a\nProduct Manager (PM)\nand a\nfrontend team\n.\nGiving people a\nstable counterpart\nallows for more social trust and familiarity, which speeds up decision making, prevents communication problems, and reduces the risk of conflicts. This way we can work effectively cross functionally without the\ndownsides of a matrix organization\n.\nFactory vs. studio\nWe want the best combination of\na factory and a studio\n. The studio element means anyone can chime in about anything, from a user to the CEO. You can step outside your work area and contribute. The factory element means everyone has a clearly assigned task and authority.\nEffective escalations\nTeam members should feel comfortable escalating issues when help is needed to resolve unexpected challenges. Effective escalations are good, because they speed up decision making. When team members escalate an issue, another person is brought in as a decision maker or adviser as other team members disagree or need help with alignment or a serious trade-off is needed. Escalation can offer clarity and a path forward, and can be a sign of seniority for the person initiating the escalation when they know what, how, and when to escalate.\nAs noted in this\nmedium article\n, explicit esclatation should answer these four questions:\nWhy is this important to the person/team I’m escalating to?\nWhat are the relevant details of the challenge?\nWhat have you tried?\nWhat do you need?\nFolks who are escalating an issue should avoid surprising folks in the management chain. This means that other relevant team members should be aware that an escalation is occurring. For example, in E-Group, members agree that they will not go to the CEO with an escalation without first notifying other relevant members that this is happening.\nThere may be some exceptions to first notifying managers or peers. For example, a team member\nfeels unsafe\nin voicing a concern to a manager or their peers and feels that they can’t effectively escalate with standard notification without retribution. While exceptions may be appropriate, they should be rare.\nAfter a team member escalates an issue, it is OK if they\ndisagree, commit, and advocate\nwith the decisions made by the person they escalated to.\nProcess gets a bad rep\nProcess has a bad reputation. It has that reputation for things that we try to avoid doing at GitLab. When you have processes that are not needed it turns into a bureaucracy. A good example are approval processes. We should keep approval processes to a minimum, by both giving people the authority to make decisions by themselves and by having a quick lightweight approval process where needed.\nBut process also has good aspects. Having a documented process for how to communicate within the company greatly reduces time spend on on-boarding, increases speed, and prevents mistakes. A counterintuitive effect is that it also makes it easier to change processes. It is really hard to change a process that doesn’t have a name or location and lives in different versions in the heads of people. Changing a written process and distributing the\ndiff\nis much easier.\nTalent Acquisition and retention\nManagers have an tremendous responsibility around talent acquisition and\nretention\nof team members.\nVoluntary departures should be low, especially unexpected ones. The most common reasons for resignations can be tied back to the manager.\nWe want few candidates to decline an offer, especially when the reason isn’t compensation.\nWe need adequate candidate pipeline volume and quality, especially for crucial positions.\nCandidates that have a proposed offer should meet the bar, especially for more senior positions.\nBuild a\nglobal team\n. Unless shown with a business case, “we can’t find the talent out of the bay” goes against our\ndiversity, inclusion and belonging mission\nand the\nLocation Factor KPI\n.\nHigh Output Management\nGitLab leadership and management approach was built using principles covered in the book “\nHigh Output Management\n.” Please see\nHigh Output Management\nto learn more.\nBuilding High Performing Teams\nBuilding a team to deliver\nresults\nis a very important aspect of improving\nefficiency\nand\niteration\n. A high-performing team will always deliver results. As a leader at GitLab, your role is to develop a high-performing team to reach the desired level of performance and productivity. There are certain traits that high-performing teams display at GitLab:\nHave a clear vision of their objectives and goals\nStay committed to achieving their goals\nManage conflicts\nMaintain effective communication and a healthy relationship with each other\nMake unanimous decisions as a team\nWatch the replay of our conversation with\nJeb Hurley, Co-founder and Managing Partner Brainware Partners\nwhere we discussed:\nManaging trust, productivity, and well-being on remote teams\nBehavior, biochemistry, and dynamics of trust\nThe value of measuring and reporting on impacts of building trust\nSkills and behavior of\nbuilding high performing teams competency\nfor Managers\n:\nModels and encourages teamwork by fostering collaboration, communication,\ntrust\n, shared goals, mutual accountability and support\nFosters an environment where results are balanced with time management of multiple assignments and\nDirect Responsible Individuals (DRI’s)\non important topics\nEmpowers team members to be a\nManager of One\nand gives them the tools to grow professionally in their careers\nAttracts and retains top talent by creating an inclusive environment\nbuilt on trust\n, delegation, accountability, and teachability\nStrategies to Build High Performing Teams\nThe\nDrexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model\nis an excellent tool to help\nbuild high performing teams\nat GitLab. The model provides a roadmap for a team and a common language. It is a simplified description of how a team works together that highlights the most important things the team needs to focus on to reach high performance. At GitLab, we can use it as a frame of reference to developing high performing teams. It can help Managers ensure new and existing team members know the mission and direction of the team by the following:\nTo form your team\nTo guide what your team does\nTo monitor how well your team is doing\nTo diagnose where your team may be struggling or identify the keys to your team’s success.\n7 Stages to developing high performing teams:\nOrientation - Why are we here? Team members need to see a sense of team identity and how individual team members fit in.\nTrust Building\n- Who are you? Team members share mutual regard for each other and are open and supportive of trust-based relationships.\nGoal Clarification - What are we doing? Assumptions are made clear; individual assumptions are made known with a clear vision of the end state.\nCommitment - How will we do it? Team members understand how it will make decisions and do the work.\nImplementation - Who does what, when, where? Team members have a sense of clarity and can operate effectively due to the alignment of shared goals.\nHigh Performance - Wow! The team is accomplishing more than it expected. The team has taken off, creativity is fostered and goals are surpassed.\nRenewal - Why continue? The team is given recognition and celebrates achievements of individuals that produce valuable work. Reflect on lessons learned and reassess for the future.\nManager Resource: Identifying & Addressing Burnout\nBuilding and maintaining high performance includes staying mindful of team well-being and potential burnout. With GitLab’s results-driven culture, the demands of product innovation around AI, the fast-paced and ever-evolving business environment, our organization recognizes the crucial balance between achieving ambitious goals and maintaining the well-being of our team members. Everyone can access this handbook\nresource designed for managers to identify & address burnout\n. This has an ongoing impact on team performance.\nManager M-Team Groups\nM-teams are management support groups made up of 3 to 6 managers who are in timezones that allow for sync meetings among members. M-teams should set up a regular meeting on a cadence agreed by the members with the agenda being “what’s challenging this week?”.
