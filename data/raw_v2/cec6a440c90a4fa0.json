Please find our internal processes in the\nAccounting and Reporting\ninternal handbook section.\nQuote to cash\nInvoicing to customers\nCalculated Billings\nCalculated billings is defined as revenue plus the sequential change in total deferred revenue as presented on the balance sheet.\nWe do not believe that calculated billings provides a meaningful indicator of financial performance as billings can be impacted by timing volatility of renewals, co-terming upgrades and multi year prepayment of subscriptions.\nFor order approval and invoicing process please view the\nBilling Ops page.\nInvoicing: One Time Events\nSend the below information via email to\nar@gitlab.com\nCompany name\nCompany AP email\nAddress\nBilling contact name\nBilling contact email\nCharge amount\nEvent name and subject\nAmendments to Subscriptions\nTo amend a customer’s account, choose one of the options below from the subscription page in Zuora.\nTerms and Conditions - used to change the end date of a product\nNew Product - choose when adding a product\nUpdate a product - choose when making a change to a current product\nRemove a product - used when removing a product\nRenewal\nZuora Subscription Data Management\nBasic Assumptions\nSubscriptions should only be cancelled with 45 days of the start. Exceptions can be made (see\nSupport Workflows\n)\nSubscriptions can be linked across multiple Zuora and SalesForce (SFDC) Accounts, but not SFDC Ultimate Parent Accounts.\nAll Zuora Accounts must be linked to a valid SFDC Account.\nMRR can change historically due to customer behavior (renewals, cancellations, etc.)\nNew Accounts vs New Subscriptions\nThere are instances where a new account in Zuora is required rather than just a new subscription in an existing account. This is determined by the sold-to contact person.\nWithin the customer account portal, customers can only see a single Zuora account at a time. If a customer wants to add a subscription and the contact information is the same, then the subscription can be added to the existing account.\nIf a customer wants an additional subscription for a different sold to contact, then a new Zuora account will be created so that every sold to contact can log into the portal and manage their subscriptions.\nLinking Renewal Subscriptions\nWhen a customer renews their subscription, a new subscription is typically created. This can create challenges for calculating metrics like dollar retention for a subscription because once subscription has ended and another has started. To address this, a linkage is made between the original subscription and its renewal(s).\nThe field\nRenewal subscription\nis used to create the mapping. These are the following constraints on this field:\nThis field defines a unidirectional relationship that points to a separate subscription name.\nA renewal subscription can start on the same or future day as the original subscription start date to which it is linked to, but never in the past.\nAny number of subscriptions can point to the same renewal subscription as long as the time constraint is met.\nA subscription may have any number of renewal subscriptions that it points to as long as the time constraint is met. This is a one-to-many relationship. Each renewal subscription to which the original subscription is linked is input in the field and are separated by two pipes.\nFor example, subscription\nA-S00009093\nis linked to\nA-S00009096 || A-S00009095\nRenewal subscriptions can point to subscriptions under separate Zuora Accounts\nRenewal subscriptions can start 12 months or less after the original subscription. Practically, this is because a linkage of greater than 12 months has no effect on any relevant metrics (Retention or Yearly counts).\nThe process to make the linkage is as follows:\nCancel the old subscription in Zuora.\nCopy and paste the new subscription in “Renewal Subscription” field with no trailing spaces.\nZuora subscription status ‘active’\nThe active subscription status in Zuora needs to be reviewed in connection to the end date.\nIf the end date is in the future it means that the subscription is still within the term and the customer is able to use the product.\nAn ‘active’ subscription with an end date in the past means that the subscription was not renewed and the customer doesn’t have access to the product since the end date.\nWe currently don’t actively cancel these subscriptions as this is a manual process and the cancellation or lack of it does not have any impact on other processes.\nAdditionally, where subscriptions remain in an active status they can be renewed by the customers on the CustomersDot\nInvoice cancellations and refunds\nFor step by step processes please view\nBilling Ops page.\nHow to process a partial refund in Stripe\nLog in to Stripe.\nType in the cardholder’s name in the search field at the top of the screen.\nClick on the original charge that will be refunded.\nClick on the refund button.\nEnter in the amount to refund.\nEnter in the reason code.\nIn the description field, enter the reason for the refund and include the invoice that was created in Zuora for the refunded amount.\nClick on refund.\nGo back to Zuora.\nPut the customer account in silent mode under “Communication Profile.”\nPost the invoice draft.\nTransfer to credit balance.\nAccounting Code: Stripe - Inc\nPut the customer account back into Default/B2B under “Communication Profile.”\nVerify that the balance due is $0.00 on the refund invoice that was created.\nManually e-mail the customer, do not use Zuora to create the email as you cannot update the contents. Include a screenshot of the partial refund from Stripe and attach a copy of the refund invoice.\nAccounting for income from sale of merchandise\nPosting Swag Shop transactions in NetSuite\nTransactions from the Swag Shop are remitted to the Comerica checking account daily and should be booked in NetSuite at the end of each month.\nIn Shopify, download the transaction report in CSV format (found under Orders, then Export).\nThis report contains swag shop revenue and tax data to be recorded in NetSuite.\nIn portal used for swag download the orders report which should include cost for swag sold.\nRecord the revenue, tax, cost and cash received.  At times cost maybe estimated using a historical average.\nRecord the tax collected in the Ava Tax Portal.\nCreate a journal entry in NetSuite under the GitLab Inc subsidiary, using the last day of the month as the entry date.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounting for customer collections\nCash Receipt\nCredit card customer\nFollow this procedure if the customer paid by credit card.\nYou may recall from the invoicing process that there was still a balance due when saving the invoice.  The following steps will record the payment and remove the balance due.\nLogin to Stripe dashboard and click on Payments under Transactions (left hand side). You will see a listing of the latest Stripe transactions listed by amount, Recurly transaction, name, date, and time. There is also an option to filter the report by clicking on XXX at the top left. Click on XXX to export to excel. This will give you a workbook area and also a breakdown of the fees which we will work on later.\nIn NetSuite, click on the “Transactions” tab on the left.\nClick on the orange “OPEN INVOICES \" tab. This will bring up all open invoices listed by date, invoice #, customer, etc.\nMatch invoice #s  between the Stripe dashboard and NetSuite. If you click on a transaction in the Stripe dashboard, it will take you to a screen that shows more detail, including the invoice # being paid. You can work your way from the bottom up.\nIn NetSuite, click “Receive Payment” on the matched payment and invoice.\nReceiving the payment\nEnter the payment date, which is the payment date from Stripe dashboard.\nPayment method = Credit Card.\nReference no. = “Recurly Transaction ID:” found under Metadata in Stripe dashboard.\nDeposit to = Stripe.\nNetSuite will auto-fill the payment amount with the entire balance due. No need to change this unless the payment amount from Stripe is different.\nClick on “Save and Close”.\nRepeat the above for all the remaining invoices that were paid by credit card.\nPost a journal entry to record Stripe Fees.\nIn NetSuite, click on the “+” sign. Under “Other”, select “Journal Entry”.\nIt is okay to leave the journal date as long as it is within the month the fees were incurred. If not, change it to the last day of the month.\nNetSuite will auto fill the journal number. Do not change.\nAccount #1 Entry\nFill the “Account #1” entry with “Credit Card Transaction fees”.\nFill the “Debits” entry with the value from the Stripe report that was exported. The value will be the sum of “Column I” in the Stripe report, which is the fee amount. Be sure to only sum the rows which you just posted payments for.\nLeave the “Credits” entry empty.\nFill the “Description” entry with “To record credit card transaction fees for period (enter the date range for the transactions posted)”.\nLeave the “Name” entry empty.\nFill the “Class” entry with “Sales”.\nAccount #2 Entry\nFill the “Account #2” entry with “Stripe”.\nLeave the “Debits” entry empty.\nThe “Credits” entry will autofill. This should be the same amount as the “Debits” entry for Account #1.\nThe “Description” entry will autofill. This should be the same as the “Description” entry for Account #1.\nLeave the “Name” entry blank.\nLeave the “Class” entry blank.\nClick “Save”.\nThis transaction transfers the payment obligation from the customer to Stripe.  The payment obligation from Stripe is removed when Stripe transfers  the funds to GitLab’s bank account.\nPosting a payment from Stripe when a transfer is received from Stripe\nPost a journal entry:\nFill the “Journal Date” with the date that payment was received in the bank.\nFill the “Credit Account” with Stripe.\nFill the “Debit Account” with “Comerica Checking - GitLab Inc.”\nLeave “Name” blank.\nLeave “Class” blank.\nFill the “Description” with “To record Stripe transfer (date of transfer)”.\nClick “Save”.\nPosting a payment from a “bank customer”\nIn Netsuite:\nClick on the “+” sign.\nClick on “Receive Payment” under Customers.\nFill the “Payment Date” with the date payment was received.\nFill the “Payment Method” choose from the dropdown menu.\nFill the “Reference No.” with the check # or bank reference # from incoming wire.\nFill the “Deposit to” with “Comerica Checking”.\nFill the “Amount Received” with the amount received from the incoming wire.\nFor step by step cash collections process please view\nBilling Ops page.\nAccount receivable provisions, bad debts and other period close adjustments\nAccounts Receivable Performance Indicators\nTime for Invoices to be generated when a deal is closed won in Salesforce < 24 hours\nThe time from when a deal is closed won in Salesforce to when the invoice is generated. Professional services are excluded from this performance indicator. This is tracked over a calendar month. The target is < 24 hours.\nAccounts Receivable Process for Non-Payment of Invoices\nBilling & Revenue team review AR Aging as on a monthly basis. Fifty (50) percent of the balances that are Ninety (90) days or more after the due date and One Hundred (100) percent of the balances that are One Hundred and Twenty (120) days or more after the due date are reserved as allowance for doubtful debt. Bad debt expense is recorded based on revenue recognised, future revenue recognition is stopped and deferred revenue is reversed all at the Netsuite level.\nFuture amortisation of commissions expenses related to reserved invoices should also be stopped to ensure alignment with pattern of revenue recognition.\nAllowance for doubtful debt will be shared with Sales Operations on a monthly basis to ensure they have visibility of what may be written off in the future.\nOn a quarterly basis, Senior Billing Manager and Revenue Director will determine the aged invoices that are uncollectible. They will create an issue ten (10) days before the end of the quarter to seek approval according to the\nsignature auhorization matrix\nto write off invoices and to also notify the Sr. Director of Sales Operations. Sales Operations will then create decommission opportunities in SFDC for approved write offs before the end of the quarter and these will be synced to Zuora to reverse original invoicing and revenue. Sales Operations will claw back commissions accordingly.\nRevenue team will review write-offs processed in Zuora to ensure correct revenue reversal and will book MJEs in Netsuite to reclass impact to Bad Debt Reserve.\nCustomers that have had their invoices written off, consider no discounts or credit given for future deals.\nWhere payment is received for an invoice after it has been written off, the write off will be reversed and the related commission will be reinstated.\nProcure to Pay\nProcure to pay is the process of requisitioning, purchasing, receiving, paying for and accounting for goods and services. It includes the following sub processes of both the\nProcurement\nand\nAccounts Payable\ndepartments:\nVendor Master Management\nIf the vendor is not already set up in NetSuite it is considered a new vendor.\nAccording to the new vendor’s Legal Entity, they will be onboarded into Coupa.\nNew Vendor Onboarding - Coupa\nCoupa is a procure-to-pay system that streamlines the purchase request process, initiate workflow with approvals, and enable Purchase Orders. We will be rolling out in a phased approach, with the US and Netherlands entities (GitLab Inc, Federal, IT BV and BV) in Phase I (2021-06-01). The remaining entities will be part of Phase II (2021-12-13).\nYou can learn more about Coupa on our\nFAQ Page\nHow vendors are added into Coupa:\nAny Coupa user can request a new supplier using the New Supplier Request form.\nCheck\nHow to Request a New Supplier in Coupa\nfor a detailed guide.\nOnce the New Supplier Request is approved, an External Supplier Form will be automatically sent to the Supplier to gather additional information.\nSupplier must complete the form and submit it back.\nAfter supplier submission, the external form will be routed to Accounts Payable Approval Group for review and approval.\nAfter approval, the Supplier details will be integrated to NetSuite. Once the supplier is successfully created in NetSuite, it will flow back to Coupa to complete the New Supplier creation. By then, the Supplier should be available when creating Purchase Requests and Invoices.\nNote\nIf you are a GitLab recurring vendor and did not receive an onboarding email from Coupa, please reach out to\nap@gitlab.com\n.\nInvoice Accounting\nEntering a Bill (invoice) in NetSuite\nPlease note the below steps reference how to manually enter bills into NetSuite.  Effective 2019-11-01 all AP invoices were processed through Tipalti. Effective 2021-06-01 (Coupa Phase I) and 2021-12-13 (Coupa Phase II), AP invoices will be processed in Coupa. These systems will automatically record the transaction into NetSuite after the invoice has been approved by the corresponding business partner in the respective system.\nOn the NetSuite home page, click the “+” icon near the global search bar at the top of the screen and select “Bill.”\nSelect the appropriate vendor record. If adding a new vendor, follow the bullets below before proceeding, otherwise skip to step 3.\nEnter the company name, email address, applicable subsidiary, physical address, payment terms, primary currency, and Tax ID. (Note that the address field is located under the “Address” tab, while the Tax ID, primary currency, and payment terms fields are located under the “Financial” tab)\nEnter the banking information in the “Comments” field then click “Save.”\nGo to the “+” icon at the top of the vendor record and select “Bill” from the dropdown box.\nEnter Bill date. The due date should auto-fill based on payment terms entered during vendor setup. If not, select the correct due date and update the vendor record after the bill has been entered and saved.\nEnter Bill number.\nGo to the “Expense and Items” tab below to enter the expense details.\nSelect appropriate GL-account under the “Account” dropdown box. (Be sure to check whether the invoice represents a prepaid expense, fixed asset, etc.)\nEnter Bill amount.\nSelect tax code, if applicable.\nEnter department. (This must be entered if the account you selected in step 6 is an expense account)\nAdd attachments: Go to the “Communication” tab and find the “Files” subtab.\nClick “New File.” A new window will appear, allowing you to select the file you wish to attach.\nIn the new window, select the “Attachments Received” folder in the dropdown box, then click “Choose File” to attach both a copy of the vendor bill and email approval. (The supporting email approval must be attached along with a copy of the invoice)\nClick “Save.”\nIn Google Drive, file invoice in the “Unpaid” folder.\nInvoicing in Coupa\nCoupa is a Procurement and Invoicing Tool. Similarly to purchase requests for goods/services that must be initiated in Coupa, invoices are also created and approved in Coupa.\nFor all issues created before Coupa Go-Live (Phase I; 2021-06-01 and Phase II; 2021-12-13), the business will not be setting up Purchase Orders for those and the Accounts Payable team will manually enter the related invoices as Non PO-backed.\nInvoices in Coupa can be created via 4 different channels:\nCoupa Supplier Portal (CSP)\nFree, Web-based portal specifically for suppliers.\nSuppliers receive POs within CSP Coupa inbox and perform PO Flips to Invoices and is able to see a complete history of all their POs/invoices.\nOnce CSP invoices are submitted by the supplier, Coupa triggers the approval workflows.\nSupplier Actionable Notification (SAN)\nSuppliers act directly (flip PO to invoice) from Coupa PO SAN email.\nNo need to register for/sign into Coupa/CSP, free service available any suppliers (with email).\ncXML\nFor “high-touch” suppliers (e.g. Amazon, CDW) with cXML invoicing capability to receive POs and transmit invoices directly.\nWorks well in conjunction with punchouts.\nManual Entry in Coupa UI\n“Flip PO” option copies data from Coupa PO to pre-populate invoice fields for faster entry.\nNon PO backed invoice manual entry.\nCoupa Integration - troubleshooting for Invoices\nA NetSuite error log identifying invoice integration issues will be emailed to the Accounts Payable Team every Tuesday and Friday. The email is sent from\nFinance Systems Admins\nand the Subject is\nCoupa2NS Invoices - Integration Log\n. Download the attached file and filter by Type =\nError\nand\nAudit\n. Review the\nDetails\nfield to find the invoice number/document number that needs to be reviewed/corrected. For information regarding common errors and how to correct them, please review this\nfile\n; under the column labeled\nScript\nsearch for\nCoupa Invoice Integration\n. If any troubleshooting assistance is needed, please ask in the\n#coupa_help\nSlack channel.\nThere is also a View in Coupa that will list invoices not exported to NetSuite. Under Invoices, select View =\nNot Exported\nHowever, there will be no details regarding the integration issue. You will need to review the NetSuite error log (referenced above) for the details.\nFor vendors who invoice GitLab for multiple entities, all invoices are separated by subsidiary (due to audit standards). If the vendor onboards for the Coupa Supplier Portal (CSP), the vendor will only see the POs related to those entities, and will need to email the others. If you are a GitLab vendor who invoices for multiple entitites and you have any questions, please reach out to\nap@gitlab.com\n.\nApproving an Invoice in Coupa\nInvoices requiring PO receipts or approval will appear in user’s To Do list within Coupa. Users will also receive email notifications from Coupa (depending on user’s notification setting in Coupa).\nPO receipts notifications will enable users to “Create Receipt” by clicking on the button and entering the quantity received and receipt date. Please watch the\nEnd Users training video\n(starting at the 30:15 mark) for more information.\nApproval notifications will enable users to reject or approve invoices by clicking on the appropriate button.\nTop information to verify before approving an invoice\nVerify invoice copy is attached\nVerify correct PO is matched\nVerify coding (Billing) is correct\nVerify service date is entered and correct\nVerify tag/class is entered (if applicable)\nVerify invoice total is correct\nIf there are issues with any of the above items, please tag\n@Accounts Payable Approval Group\nin the Comments section with details.\nDisputing an Invoice in Coupa\nThe invoice dispute process in Coupa enables the Accounts Payable team to request corrections on invoices from suppliers.\nInvoices in “AP Hold”, “Pending Action”, “Pending Receipt”, “On Hold”, “Pending Approval” or “Rejected” statuses can be disputed to the supplier for corrections. Disputing an invoice requires a dispute reason and sends an email notification to the supplier contact on record and any additional listed recipients.\nOnce disputed, an invoice can be Withdrawn from Dispute by Accounts Payable or Voided; or Resolved by the supplier.\nRejecting an Invoice in Coupa\nThe invoice rejection process in Coupa allows the Accounts Payable team to make adjustments on invoices before restarting approvals, continuing approvals or disputing the invoice back to the supplier. This is an internal status that suppliers cannot see indicating that an approver or approval group rejected the invoice. Comments are required when rejecting an invoice - please provide as much detail/information as possible.\nManually Entering a Bill (invoice) in NetSuite\nPlease note the below steps reference how to manually enter bills into NetSuite.  Effective 2019-11-01 all AP invoices should be getting processed through Tipalti and Effective 2021-06-01 we will begin to process in Coupa as well. These 2 systems will automatically record the transaction into NetSuite after the invoice has been approved by the corresponding business partner in the respective system.\nOn the NetSuite home page, click the “+” icon near the global search bar at the top of the screen and select “Bill.”\nSelect the appropriate vendor record.\nIf adding a new vendor, follow the bullets below before proceeding, otherwise skip to step 3\nEnter the company name, email address, applicable subsidiary, physical address, payment terms, primary currency, and Tax ID.

(The supporting email approval must be attached along with a copy of the invoice)\nClick “Save.”\nIn Google Drive, file invoice in the “Entered” folder for that entity.\nPayment Process\nBillable Expenses\nIf you have an expense report that can be billed back to a customer please make sure to check the “billable” flag in Navan along with tagging the customer name under the “customer” field in Navan.\nProcessing payment for invoices in Coupa\nSupplier Payment Accounts (SPAs) are required in order to pay suppliers from Coupa Pay.\nThere are four different ways that suppliers will be able to provide their payment information:\nSmart Onboarding Form\n: Native Coupa capability within the Coupa Supplier Portal that will allow supplier to capture their banking information.\nSIM (Supplier Information Management) Form\n: Whenever GitLab onboards a new supplier, as part of the External Form, there is a section to capture the vendor’s remit to information, along with their bank account information.\n(This is where the majority of GitLab suppliers will be providing their banking information)\n.\nCoupa Supplier Portal (CSP) Legal Entity Section\n: Mostly used if a supplier is changing their bank account information or needs to make any updates. The vendor is able to manage that directly within their Coupa Supplier Portal profile and either add a new legal entity (which will be associated with a new bank account) or adjust an existing one.\nInvoicing Section\n: If for some reason, a supplier is submitting their first invoice and they have not provided their banking information before they are creating their first invoice, that will create a new supplier payment account in Coupa.\nIf you are a GitLab vendor and you want to know more about how to update your CSP profile, check Coupa’s\nCreate or Update Your Profiles\ndocumentation.\nAfter the supplier submits their supplier payment account information, it will transfer into Coupa automatically and create a supplier payment account record.\nIf the supplier is going through the SIM process, the approval for that supplier payment account will occur directly on the SIM External Form, and AP won’t have to go into the supplier payment accounts to provide approval.\nFor more information regarding how to set up SPAs or Coupa Pay, please check out the lower section of our\nCoupa FAQ page\n.\nCreating a Batch in Coupa\nOnly Invoices in the “Ready to Pay” status can be utilized to create a batch.\nInvoices can be removed from payment by Coupa Pay using the slider button under “Actions”\n(in case a supplier is selected for Coupa pay but need to be paid out of NetSuite, switch their payment method to ERP)\n.\nThe “Pay from Account” (Company Payment Account or CPA) will be automatically defaulted based on the Chart Of Accounts. The CPA can be adjusted manually by selecting the dropdown.\nThe “Pay to Account” (Supplier Payment Account or SPA) will be defaulted based on the Remit-To entered on the invoice.\nApproving a Batch in Coupa\nApproval chains are generated before a payment batch can be released.\nSegregation of Duties:\nThe creator of the Batch cannot be the releasor of the same batch regardless of the permissions they have.\nCoupa Integration - troubleshooting for Payments\nA NetSuite error log identifying payment integration issues will be emailed to the Accounts Payable Team every Tuesday and Friday. The email is sent from\nFinance Systems Admins\nand the Subject is\nCoupa2NS Pay Payments Integration Log\n. Download the attached file and filter by Type =\nError\nand\nAudit\n. Review the\nDetails\nfield to find the payment number that needs to be reviewed/corrected. For information regarding common errors and how to correct them, please see this\nfile\n; under the column labeled\nScript\nsearch for\nCoupa Invoice Payment Integration\n. If any troubleshooting assistance is needed, please ask in the\n#coupa_help\nSlack channel.\nThere is also a View in Coupa that will list payments not exported to NetSuite. Under Payments, select View =\nNot Exported\nHowever, there will be no details regarding the integration issue. You will need to review the NetSuite error log (referenced above) for the details.\nHow to access Coupa\nCoupa is available via Okta. To access the platform:\nLogin to your\nOkta home page\n.\nClick on the Coupa (Prod) button.\nA new tab should open with your user logged in.\nPlease note that every month all Coupa access will be reviewed and users who haven’t been active in a period of 90 days will have their access removed.\n(Note that this number may vary depending on the license count for the current month)\nIf you need to request access again, please reopen your initial Access Request issue and tag the Finance Systems Admins team using\n@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops\nin a comment.\nIf your job function requires you to submit purchase requests in Coupa, follow the below steps:\nOpen an\nAccess Request\nfor Coupa using the\nIndividual_Bulk_Access_Request\ntemplate.\nIn Step 2, in the\nJustification for this access\nquestion, please describe:\nWhat you need to buy.\nWhat is the total cost of the purchase.\nHow often you will need to purchase it.\nWhen does it need to be submitted in Coupa.\nAdd the labels ~“FinSys - Coupa” and ~“FinSys::Service Desk”.\nBest Practices\nDue to the limited number of licenses available for Coupa, it is recommended that each department identify power users responsible for creating purchase requests on the team's behalf.\nExpenses\nPlease refer to GitLab’s\nExpense Policy\nfor further details.\nTeam Member Reimbursements - Navan\nProcessing Navan Reports\nNavan will auto sync and record expense reports into NetSuite once the report is “final approved”.  “Final approved” means it has been approved by the team member’s manager and completed an audit review by an Accounts Payable analyst or our external contractor, Montgomery Pacific (Montpac).\nAccounts payable will do a daily check to ensure all reports which are “final approved” are successfully synced.  If any errors arise, AP will work out the errors until the report syncs into NetSuite.\nBillable Expenses\nIf you have an expense report that can be billed back to a customer please make sure to check the “billable” flag in Navan along with tagging the customer name under the “customer” field in Navan.\nPaying Navan Reports\nTeam members in a US expense policy will be automatically reimbursed through Navan after their report is “final approved” within 1-4 business days.\nThe team member must set up their bank account in Navan.\nOnce an team member is reimbursed, Navan will auto sync the payment to the expense record to mark the report as reimbursed.\nThis will feed into NetSuite to show the bill as fully paid as well.\nTeam memebers in a country paid through PEO will also receive expense reimbursement through their same payroll PEO payments each month.\nPlease Note:\nThe timing of reimbursement can vary if you are being reimbursed directly from payroll, CXC, SafeGuard, Global PEO, Remote and/or iiPay.\nMore information on the timing of payouts can be found\nhere\nAll non-US GitLab entities will be reimbursed through their respective payroll provider or paid directly through GitLab’s Accounts Payable (AP) department with the normal weekly payment run.\nExpense report must have been “final approved” no later than EOD Tuesday of that same week.\nAny report “final approved” on Wednesday to Friday of that week will be reimbursed the following week.\nOnce an employee is reimbursed, AP will create the payment in NetSuite against the record to close the report as paid.\nAP will manually mark the expense reports as “Reimbursed” in Navan once they are confirmed to the payroll provider or batched to Tipalti.\nPaying Navan Reports in Tipalti\nEntites included: GmbH, BV, PTY LTD, Ireland, IT BV and GK.\nAP will send the team member an auto generated email from Tipalti with instructions on how to onboard.\nOnly after a team member onboards themselves in Tipalti will payments be issued. Payee profile will show as “Payable”.\nAny team memebers hired after 2019-11-01 will be sent onboarding requests upon hire and/or upon first submission of an expense report.\nFurther details on the Expense reimbursement process can be found\nhere\nAccounts Payable Analyst Performance Indicators - Expenses\nAverage days to action <= 3 business days\nNumber of days from when an team member’s manager approves report to when AP analyst does final approval for payment or responds to team member in Navan if there is a concern. (Approval for payment is not the reimbursement date.) This is calculated on a calendar month basis. The target for this is currently three business days.\nTime to get a new team member set up in Navan < 3 business days\nHave new team member set up in Navan within 3 business days from team member start date.\nTravel and Expense Guidelines\nSpend reduction\nWhen reducing spend, we will not take the easy route of (temporarily) reducing discretionary spending.\nDiscretionary spending includes expenses like travel, conferences, gifts, bonuses, merit pay increases and summits.\nBy reducing in these areas we put ourselves at risk of\nincreasing voluntary turnover among the people we need most\n.\nDiscretionary spending is always subject to questioning, we are frugal and all spending needs to contribute to our goals.\nBut, we should not make cuts in reaction to the need to reduce spend; that would create a mediocre company with mediocre team members.\nInstead, we should do the hard work of identifying positions and costs that are not contributing to our goals.\nEven if this causes a bit more disruption in the short term, it will help us ensure we stay a great place to work for the people who are here.\nNon-Reimbursable Expenses\nIn order to purchase goods and services on behalf of the company, you should first\nconsult the Signature Authorization Matrix\nto determine the approval requirements. Note that this\ndoes not\ninclude travel expenses and other incidentals. These expenses should be self-funded then submitted for reimbursement within Navan, or in the case of independent contractors, included in invoices to the company (per the guidelines above).\nIf further approval is not required, then proceed to the Procurement\n“What are you buying” page\nfor further instructions on the purchasing process at GitLab. Once those procedures are complete, have your vendor send their invoice to Accounts Payable:\nap@gitlab.com\n.  Most importantly, the team member making the purchase request is ultimately responsible for final review and approval of the invoices. Final review and approval are critical process controls that help ensure we do not make erroneous payments to vendors. All original invoices and payment receipts must be sent to Accounts Payable.\nCreation of Expense Tags\nIf you would like to track spend for a particular campaign, project and/or event you can do that through expense tag, also known as classes in NetSuite.  If you would like to request an expense tag/class to be set up please open\nthis tracker\nand enter the information required for the General Ledger (GL) team to create the tag.\nThe GL team will create the tags at the end of each day.\nThe tag is created in Netsuite and syncs with Navan and Coupa.\nRequisitions can be saved for later, while you complete the tag creation process.\nCreate Classes In NetSuite:\nIn NetSuite go to Setup-Company-Classes-New\nAdd the name of the expense tag under Name\nUnder subsidiaries highlight GitLab Inc and check the box that states “Include in Children”\nSave\nNavan will auto-sync any new “expense tags” on a daily basis, but if the Navan admin wants to manually sync they can do so by following these steps:\nImport new Classes/Tags In Navan:\nGo to the Admin page and click on the\nPolicies\ntab.\nSelect a policy and find the\nConnections\nsubtab. The NetSuite connector is located on this page.\nClick the\nSync Now\nbutton for the NetSuite connector. The page will run a prompt showing sync status.\nOnce the syncing process is complete, go to the\nTags\nsubtab.\nSearch for the tag by name under classifications (i.e. the NetSuite profiles created in prior steps)\nCorporate Credit Cards\nPlease review this\npage\nfor the current policy/procedures.\nContribute Costs and other key expenses\nMarketing Campaign Expenses\nPlease see the\ncampaign expense guidelines in the Marketing handbook\n.\nGitLab Contribute Cost Tracking\n(Previously GitLab Summit)\nTracking expenses for company Contributes enables us to analyze our spend and find opportunities to iterate, and in turn, improve subsequent Contributes. To enable tracking we create an expense tag that will allow GitLab team-members to tag Contribute related expenses in Navan. This should be done prior to the announcement of each Contribute.\nTo categorize an expense under an expense tag to track a specific marketing campaign, contribute expense and/or any special project you will do this under the “classifications” tag in Navan.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet. Following are the sub-processes:\nAcquisition and Capitalization\nCapital Assets Policy\nPurpose\nThis policy establishes the minimum cost (capitalization amount) used to determine the capital assets recorded in GitLab’s financial statements.\nCapital Assets Defined\nA “Capital Asset” is a unit of property that has an economic useful life extending beyond 12 months\nand\nwas acquired (or in some cases, produced) for a cost of\n$5,000 (USD)\nor more. Capital Assets must be capitalized and depreciated for financial reporting purposes.\nCapitalization Thresholds\nGitLab establishes\n$5,000 (USD)\nas the minimum amount required for capitalization. Any item with a cost below this amount is expensed on the date of purchase. Exceptions are Key Component Assets (i.e. computer laptops).\nBulk purchases (“like” items acquired with a single purchase order, which are received within a reasonable period of time of one another (less than 60 days) and that individually have an Acquisition Cost less than the Individual Purchases Capitalization Threshold) have a Capitalization Threshold of $50,000 (USD)\nDepreciation/Amortization\nMethodology\nAll capital assets are recorded at historical cost as of the acquisition date. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the number of depreciation periods being determined by asset class.\nComputer and I/T Equipment:\nFor our purposes, Computer and I/T Equipment generally consists of computers (laptops) and are assigned a standard useful life of two (2) years. This depreciation schedule applies to all entities.\nOffice Equipment and Furniture & Fixtures:\nThe standard useful life for Office Equipment and Furniture & Fixtures is five (5) years. This depreciation schedule applies to all entities.\nInvoices and purchase receipts for capital assets are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\nFixed Asset Register and Asset Tracking\nItems paid for by the company are property of the company. Assets with purchasing value in excess of\n$5000 USD\nor Key Component Assets are recorded and tracked through NetSuite Fixed Asset Management (FAM) module, which includes details of individual asset purchased. The Asset Register report provided by NetSuite FAM provides each individual asset purchased with the following information:\nPeriod and Date of purchase\nAsset Cost\nAsset Category\nAsset Description\nUseful life\nSerial number, if available\nGL Coding\nOnce the information is captured in NetSuite FAM a depreciation schedule will populate and NetSuite FAM will post a journal entry each month to record the depreciation of the asset until it is fully depreciated. The asset will remain on GitLab’s balance sheet until the asset is no longer being used and is identified to be disposed.\nDisposition of an Asset\nAssets will be disposed of if purchased by an employee upon termination (if approved by IT Ops) or if the item is no longer useful before the useful life.\nIf a team member would like to purchase an asset from the company (i.e. a laptop), they would request through an issue to IT Ops and Accounting to obtain the amount to be paid. This is derived from original cost less accumulated depreciation.  If an asset is purchased, Accounting will collect the funds and will book the appropriate accounting treatment to dispose of the asset.\nIf an asset is no longer usable before the useful life has been reached the employee needs to submit an issue to IT Ops and Accounting to inform them.  IT Ops will evaluate and if they deem the item is no longer useful, Accounting will book the appropriate accounting treatment to dispose of the asset.\nIT Ops will need to identify the asset and inform Accounting to properly dispose of the asset from NetSuite FAM.\nAccounting Policies\nRecord to report process is governed by the following accounting policies:\nGITLAB INC. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY\nRefer to Legal page for\nRelated Party Transactions policy\nAccounting Team PTO Guidelines\nOur ability to accomplish our Finance and Accounting mission of providing timely, fact-based information to drive business results as a public company depends on the participation of team members during certain critical times of year. Our accounting function provides critical, time based deliverables that directly impact our ability to support business growth and meet our public company obligations. These activities require the entire team’s support.\nTeam Members should prioritize taking time off to refresh and recharge outside of these critical windows. While these exact windows vary by team, generally we need all team members to support the last week of the quarter and first two weeks of the next quarter. Check with your manager if you are unsure what is applicable to your role. When these windows overlap a weekend (particularly the last day of the quarter) or public holiday/ Family and Friends day, we recommend team members work with their manager to reschedule the day off to a day outside of this critical end of quarter time period. If a team member is unavailable to work during this time period, they should provide their manager with at least one months’ notice whenever possible to allow for coverage to be arranged. When appropriate, we will create rotational coverage plans over holidays/weekends, while remaining in line with applicable jurisdictional requirements.\nInvestment Policy\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish the responsibility, authority and guidelines for the investment of operating surplus cash.  Surplus cash is defined as those funds exceeding the operating requirements of the Company and not immediately required for working capital or near term financial obligations.\nScope\nThis policy shall apply to the Company and all subsidiaries.  This investment policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with the overall objectives of the Company and with current financial trends.\nApproved Brokerage Institutions\nThe Company may use the following brokerage institutions:\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC\nComerica Securities, Inc.\nInvestment Objectives\nThe basic objectives of the Company’s investment program are, in order of priority:\nSafety and preservation of principal by investing in a high quality, diversified portfolio of securities, mutual funds, and bank deposits.\nLiquidity of investments that is sufficient to meet the Company’s projected cash flow requirements and strategic needs.\nMaximize after-tax market rates of return on invested funds that are consistent with the stated objectives herein, conservative risk tolerance and the Company’s current tax position.\nMaturity Limits\nIndividual security maturities should not exceed 24 months.  The weighted average maturity of the portfolio shall not exceed 12 months.  A maturity or effective maturity by definition shall include puts, announced calls or other structural features which will allow the Company to redeem the investments at a quantifiable price consistent with liquidity, safety and preservation of capital.\nEligible Investments\nUnited States Government Securities:\nMarketable debt securities which are direct obligations of the U.S.A., issued by or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government and supported by the full faith and credit of the United States.\nUnited States Government Agency Securities:\nDebt securities issued by the Government Sponsored Enterprises, Federal Agencies and certain international institutions which are not direct obligations of the United States, but involve Government sponsorship and are fully guaranteed by government agencies or enterprises, including but not limited to:\nFederal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB)\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)\nFederal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)\nMoney Market funds\nMoney Market Funds must be rated AAA or equivalent by at least one NRSROs.\nAt time of purchase investment restrictions:\nInvestment Products (Rating, Sector Concentration, Issuer Concentration)\nUS Government (AA+, No Sector Concentration, No Issue Concentration)\nAgency (AA+, 50% Sector Concentration, 10% Issuer Concentration)\nMoney Market Funds - US Government/Treasury (AAA, No Sector Concentration, 50% Issuer Concentration)\nPrepaid Expense Policy\nPurpose\nThis policy describes the methodology used to monitor and account for GitLab’s prepaid expenses.\nEffective 2022-04-01 a new Accounting Prepaid Automation Process has been implemented. Please click\nhere\nto learn more about the process, which utilizes Coupa.\nPrepaid Expenses Defined\nA\nPrepaid Expense\narises when a cash disbursement is made for goods and services prior to realizing the associated benefits of the underlying goods and services. These transactions are recorded as assets until the goods and services are realized, at which point an expense is recorded. Our minimum threshold for recording prepaid expenses is\n$5,000 USD\nIdentification and Recording of Prepaid Expenses\nOnce a purchase request makes it through the\ncompany approval workflow\n, Accounting will take the following steps to ensure prepaid expenses are recorded accurately:\nThe amount involved is\nequal to or exceeds $5,000\n. Prepaid expenses below $5,000 must be recorded as period expense immediately as incurred.\nThe prepayment is for a time period\ngreater than 12 months\n; (period of time is excluded for the Deposit of an event)\nif an amount is equal or greater than $50,000 on a single item in one invoice, it can be capitalized if the prepayment time period spans across fiscal quarters\n.\nAny\ndeposits\nmade for events in Marketing, Corporate or other departments of less than $5,000 USD will be recognized as an expense immediately on the day the invoice is received regardless of whether the event has taken place or not.\nThe $5,000 clip level normally applies per invoice or per item. However, situations may exist that would require exercising business judgement on a case by case basis (i.e. any clip level by total amount of purchase per vendor). Also, there are situations when each individual prepaid may not meet the clip level but as a whole, these prepayments are similar in nature and are purchased in a bulk and therefore, the total amount of all the prepaid should be combined and used to decide if the prepayment should be recorded. Any exceptions should be pre-approved by the Corporate Controller or PAO.\nAmortization is recorded straight line based on a mid-month amortization method as follows:\nIf the first month of service begins on the 1st to the 15th of the month, a full month amortization will be recorded in the current month.  If the first month of service begins on the 16th to the last day of the month, amortization will begin on the 1st day of the subsequent month.\nMid-Month Amortization Method does not apply to prepaid expenses with a monthly amortization equal to or greater than 50,000 USD or if the amortization if spread only over 1 period.  If monthly amortization is equal to or more than 50,000 USD, the first month amortization will be calculated based on actual number of days where services were rendered.\nPrepaid Not Paid:  For any prepaid expenses not processed for payment, an adjustment for “prepaid not paid” is posted to the respective prepaid expense account and AP manual adjustment account (GL Account 2001).  A prepaid expense is not treated as an asset if a liability remains in the AP sub-ledger.  Prepaid not paid adjustments are performed on a quarterly basis at minimum.\nAny deposits paid which will be held for more than 12 months such as security deposits or deposits to retain consultants will be booked to Security & Other Deposits (GL Account 1620)\nPrepaid Bonuses with a Clawback will be recorded to Prepaid Bonus w/Clawback (GL Account 1152) and will be amortized in accordance with the bonus agreement terms, using the mid-month convention.\nFinally, the balance is reviewed one last time when the Senior Accounting Manager performs a review of the financials prior to closing the period.\nContribute related expenses\nTeam member travel expenses are expensed in the period incurred. Costs related to third party vendors such as hotels, facilities, excursions are recorded to prepaid expenses and recognized as expense at the time of the event.\nAccrued Liabilities Policy\nPurpose\nTo provide clear guidance concerning the identification and recording of items included in GitLab’s accrued and other liability accounts. The purpose of monthly accrual processes is to allocate expenses to the proper accounting period and match expenses with related revenues. At the close of each month, accrual processes ensure that all expenses related to that month are correctly included in the company’s financial statements. Additionally, this policy establishes standards and guidelines for ensuring that GitLab accounts for monthly accruals in a manner that is compliant with management’s objectives and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This policy applies to GitLab and all subsidiaries.\nIdentification\nWe require that all expenses be recorded where expense exceeds $5K USD or above, in the period the expense was incurred. The accrual process should be completed on a monthly/quarterly basis to ensure liabilities are recorded accurately in their respective periods and/or quarters. In order to meet industry standards for Month-End close deadlines the Finance and Operations teams are responsible to provide on Working Day -1 (ex. Friday July 30th = WD -1, Monday August 2nd = WD 1) the calculations, information, details and backup needed to support the accruals.\nThe following items should be accrued monthly as necessary (note: this list is not all-inclusive):\nAccounts Payable:\nContracts: Amounts due under contracts, including retainer fees. These items should be recorded as they become billable.\nProfessional Fees: This liability includes legal, tax, and audit consulting and other professional fees.\nLegal Contingencies: Pending or threatened litigation, and actual or probable settlement. Legal contingencies should be determined with the help of GitLab’s VP of Legal - Commercial, IP & Compliance.\nWages and Compensation:\nTeam Wages: This includes employee wages and independent contractor fees.\nCommissions: Liabilities arising from commission obligations to team members who are eligible for commission compensation.\nBonuses: Liabilities related to bonus payments for GitLab team-members.\nTaxes: All employment taxes required for statutory compliance that relate to the GitLab team.\nAny other material obligation not mentioned above that is a liability of GitLab\nTiming\nObligations that accrue over time are recorded throughout the accounting period in a methodical and rational manner. Obligations that accrue when an event occurs should be recorded at the time of the event.\nFactors that are considered in determining the time of recording accrued liabilities include:\nRisks of ownership passed to GitLab through receipt of goods or services.\nThe expense must have been incurred during the month being closed; that is, the product or service must have been received on or before the last day of the month in order to qualify as an expense.\nEven though an expense may have been initially budgeted in the month, it is not eligible for accrual unless the company received the product or service.\nAccruals are reversed in the next month and re-accrued the following month, as needed.\nIf payment is due prior to receiving goods or services, the amount should be accrued to prepaid expenses.\nProcedural\nThe Finance team is responsible for having procedures in place to reconcile accounts monthly and for keeping documentation to support accrued liabilities. Payables and accrued liabilities are recorded at face value, plus or minus any applicable adjustments. In most cases, the payable amount can be determined from the vendor bill. If not, then the amount should be verified against any relevant documents before recording the liability. When actual values are not available, the recorded value should be based on best available estimates. Estimates should be based on current market price and experience/history.\nLegal Professional Fees:  Monthly templates are e-mailed by the 1st to all legal firms requesting them to complete with all outstanding bills and unbilled services as of that month end (ex. e-mails are sent by April 1st requesting services as of March 31st).  The responses from all legal firms are complied and reviewed with the VP of Legal - Commercial, IP & Compliance by the 5th, and accruals are made based on the responses and review.  In addition, any potential legal contingencies are discussed during the monthly meeting with the VP of Legal and an accrual is recorded if the loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nTax and Audit Professional Fees:  Similarly e-mails with the template are sent to the tax and audit firms and the tax responses are compiled and reviewed with the Director of Tax and the audit firm responses are reviewed with the Accounting and External Reporting Manager by the 5th and appropriate accruals are made based on the review.\nThe Sr. Accounting Manager is responsible for performing an overall review of accrued liabilities, one to three business days after accounts payable closes each month, to help ensure that all expenses are captured accurately.\nPlease see\nProcure-to-Pay\nForeign Currency Translation Policy\nOverview\nForeign currency translation describes the method used in converting a foreign entity’s functional currency (as determined and documented in GitLab.com>Finance>Issues>#630) to the reporting entity’s financial statement currency. Prior to translating the foreign entity’s financial statements into the reporting entity’s currency, the foreign entity’s financials must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), specifically under\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.52\n. GitLab’s financial statement reporting currency is USD. The functional currency of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Changes in foreign currency translation are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the consolidated statement of equity and ultimately carried over to the consolidated balance sheet, under equity.\nExchange Rates\nExchange rates used in the currency translation process vary across the three primary financial statement components:\nAssets and Liabilities:\nExchange rate between functional currency and reporting currency at period-end.\nIncome Statement:\nThe average exchange rates during the period presented.\nEquity:\nThe historical exchange rate at the date when entry is made to shareholder’s equity. Changes in retained earnings are based on historical exchange rates of each period’s income statement.\nTransaction Risk vs Translation Risk\nCurrency Transaction Risk\nCurrency transaction risk is due to company transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions must be restated into the entity functional currency equivalents before they can be recorded. Gains(losses) are recognized when a payment is made or interim balance sheet dates.\nCurrency Translation Risk\nCurrency translation risk occurs due to the company owning assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.\nCumulative Translation Adjustment\nA cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) is an entry to the comprehensive income section of a translated balance sheet that summarizes the gains(losses) resulting from exchange rate differences over time. Currency values shift constantly, affecting how a currency is valued against others. The CTA is a line item in the consolidated balance sheet that captures gains(losses) associated with international business activity and exposure to foreign markets. The changes in CTA are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). CTA’s are required under GAAP since they help distinguish between actual operating gains(losses) and those that arise from the currency translation process. Additional information on our reporting standards surrounding CTA’s can be found in\nFASB Topic 830, “Foreign Currency Matters.”\nRecording CTA - Exchange rate gains and losses for individual transactions are captured automatically by our ERP system, NetSuite. However, a CTA entry must be made in order to properly distinguish currency translation gains(losses) from other general gains(losses) in the consolidated financial statements. This entry includes reconciliation of any inter-company activity that generates foreign exchange gains(losses). The CTA is made on a monthly basis as part of our financial statement reporting cycle.\nChart of Accounts Policy\nScope\nThis policy establishes GitLab’s guidelines regarding the structure, responsibilities and requirements underlying the\nchart of accounts (COA).\nPurpose\nThis policy establishes formal responsibilities and accountabilities for how GitLab handles requests for new, modified or closed data elements on the COA. The Controller is responsible for all aspects of financial accounting and reporting, and governs the COA.  All requests for new or modified (including closure/deactivation) COA segments, hierarchies, and configuration attributes are subject to approval by the Finance team.\nChanges to the COA\nAll requests for new or modified accounts must be submitted to the Accounting Manager for review and approval through a request using the Finance issue tracker.\nThere are other stakeholders associated with the COA that may influence certain business decisions or financial system configurations. The Controller and Accounting Manager will include selected stakeholders in the related procedures and processes when and if appropriate. Potential stakeholders include, but may not be limited to:\nFinancial Planning and Analysis\nData & Analytics\nOther departments who have shared functionalities within the financial system\nThe general ledger attributes subject to this policy will be defined by the Controller based upon factors including but not limited to:\nCreating and maintaining consistency for the structure of accounts\nStandard accounting policies and practices\nRegulatory compliance requirements and reporting needs\nFinancial and operational reporting needs and requirements\nExternal accounting and financial reporting requirements\nOnce an amendment to the COA has been approved, the Accounting Manager will ensure the necessary changes are implemented by updating and then closing the issue.\nAdministration\nThe COA is maintained in NetSuite. Changes to the COA can only be made by the Controller and/or Accounting Manager.\nAccount Reconciliation Policy\nScope\nThis policy applies to GitLab Inc. (“GitLab” or the “Company”) and all of its subsidiaries.\nPurpose\nTo establish guidelines for assessing, preparing and reviewing balance sheet account reconciliations on a consistent basis in accordance with corporate policies and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).\nPolicy\nAccount reconciliations are prepared and reviewed monthly or quarterly for each active balance sheet account at the natural account level based upon the risk rating assessed (see risk rating assessment below).
