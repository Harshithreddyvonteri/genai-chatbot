tips\nChange your username at GitLab.com\nStarting point: let’s say your username is\nold-mary\nand you want it to be just\nmary\n.\nNote:\neach GitLab account is tracked by an\nuserID\n, which is a number stored in a database.\nIf we change the username, the userID does not change.\nAnd all the permissions, issues, MRs, and relevant stuff within GitLab are related to your\nuserID\n, not with your username.\nNote:\nif you are not a GitLab Team member, the same process applies except your e-mail (\nSTEP 2\n), which will be different (will not be @gitlab.com email), so you can replace it with your own email account.\nSTEP 1: Request your new username\nAs of this\nMerge Request\n, it is no longer possible to request a username via the\nNamesquatting process\n. If the username you wish to use is unavailable, you will have to pick a different one.\nSTEP 2: Create a new account with your new username\nIf support replies to you telling that the username is free to use, create a new GitLab.com account with it.\nUse a personal email to register your new account and choose one that has not been used with your old GitLab account.\nNavigate to your\nProfile Settings\n>\nEmails\n, and add a new email.\n⭐️\nTrick\n⭐️ If your email at GitLab is\nmary@gitlab.com\n, add the new email as\nmary+something@gitlab.com\n: this is a\nGmail trick\n! All your emails sent to this alias will end up in your GitLab email account 😃\nNavigate to\nhttps://gitlab.com/-/profile/notifications\nand choose the notifications email:\nmary+something@gitlab.com\n.\nOpen your old account in one browser and the new one in another browser (e.g., Chrome and Firefox, or Chrome and Safari) - log in to both accounts at the same time.\nSTEP 3: Let’s have some fun (kidding, this is critical!)\nNavigate to\nhttps://gitlab.com/-/profile/account\nin both your accounts.\nLook for your username.\nThis operation has to be done quickly, otherwise you are risking to lose your awesome new username to someone else quicker than you.\nWe need to\nswap\nthe usernames between both accounts, so you’ll keep all your history, your privileges, issues, and MRs assigned to you, etc.\nIf you work with 2 monitors, open each browser on one monitor.\nIf you don’t, open them side by side, so that you can keep an eye on both at the same time.\nRename your new username\nmary\nto something like\nmary-1\nand\nDO NOT\nclick\nupdate username\nyet.\nRename your old username\nold-mary\nto your new username\nmary\nand\nDO NOT\nupdate that either.\nJust leave them typed into the boxes.\nMake sure you did the previous step right!\n⚠️\nCRITICAL\n⚠️ Update the first one (\nmary\nto\nmary-1\n).\nImmediately, click\nupdate\non the other one (\nold-mary\nto\nmary\n).\nImmediately, rename the\nmary-1\nto your old one\nold-mary\nand click\nupdate username\nagain.\nTa-Da! 🙌\nSTEP 4: Move your projects (or not)\nNow, if you have any personal projects, you might want to import them to your new account (the one that has your old username now).\nTo do that, in your new account (the one with the old username), click\nCreate a New Project\n, give it the very same name as the original one, click\nGit - add repo by url\n, and paste the\nhttps://\nURL of your project there.\nTo make things easier, make sure all the projects you want to import are set to\npublic\nview.\nYou can make them private afterwards.\nIf you have GitLab Pages projects with the default\nGitLab.io\nurl, you will need to import them to you new account, then make a change to\ntrigger a build\nand redeploy your site.\nThey will be affected only if you’re using a\nCNAME with a subdomain instead of an A record\n.\nThis won’t affect Pages projects that use custom domains, as they all point to the same Pages server IP via\nA\nrecord.\nYour groups won’t be affected either, as they operate under their own namespace.\nAdd both users as members of your groups and nothing changes.\nThat’s it!\nSTEP 5: Update your username in other places\nDon’t forget to update your username in the following places:\nteam page\nIf you’re part of Marketing,\nMarketing Handbook\nWorkday - GitLab Username under ‘Additional Data’ > ‘View all’ in your profile actions\nSTEP 6: Set up your notifications\nTeam members choose to manage their GitLab activities in different ways. Setup your notifications in a way that works best for you.\nTo-do list:\nall team members will see a\nto-do list\nwithin their GitLab account. This will track different action items. Items can be marked as done as they are completed.\nEmail:\nteam members can choose which, if any, notifications show up in their Gmail accounts by\nusing filters\n.\nSlack notifications:\nteam members can choose to enable\nSlack notifications\n. Please note that GitLab slack expires after 90 days, so this is not a tool for longer-term activity management.\nGitLab team members’ resources\nThe\nGitLab team-member resources project\nhas a wiki for sharing among\nGitLab team-members\n.\nIt’s for topics like parenting where people may want to share knowledge, but the handbook is not the best fit.\nGitLab team members’ setups\n@tipyn\n’s\nhome office equipment and macOS setup\nLinking Gravatar photo\nLink your GitLab email address to an easily recognizable photo of yourself on GitLab, Slack, and\nGravatar\n.\nIt is company policy to use a photo, and not an avatar, a stock photo, or something with sunglasses for any of your GitLab accounts, as we have a lot of GitLab team-members and our brains are comfortable with recognizing people; let’s use them.\nNote\n: If you upload your photo to Gravatar associated with your gitlab.com email, then you can simply not set an image in your GitLab and Slack profiles and they will automatically use your Gravatar photo.  If you already uploaded individual photos to your GitLab and Slack profiles, simply removing them will cause your avatar to use the Gravatar photo by default.\nUsing Mermaid\nMermaid is a tool that allows us to create flowcharts, graphs, diagrams, Gantt charts, etc. within GitLab! Check out the\nexamples in the GitLab docs\non how to use Mermaid.\nA few additional resources that can be helpful when working with Mermaid are:\nThe\nlive mermaid editor\nto check your work!\nGitHub’s Mermaid overview\nA\nCSS color bank\nto add color to your charts.\nYou can see an example of how to add images to Mermaid charts\nhere\n.\nExamples of Mermaid charts that have been created by GitLab team members:\nTalent Development Program Chart\nby\nCassiana Gudgenov\n, People Compliance Partner\nCEO Year at a Glance\nData Infrastructure System Diagram\nAdvanced layout demos\nfor Mermaid diagrams\nNote: When creating Mermaid charts in the GitLab handbook, you need to type\nthree back tick symbols\nfollowed by the word\nmermaid\nbefore the chart, and\nthree back tick symbols\nat the end of the chart. This will enable Markdown to distinguish between .md and Mermaid. Please reference the example Mermaid charts linked above to see how this looks live.\nVisual help to differentiate between GitLab servers\nIf you are working on multiple GitLab instances and want to have a visual differentiation, you can change the default\nNavigation theme\nto a different color.\nCalculating the GitLab handbook page count\nPage counts are determined through a simple two-step process:\nCount the number of words in the handbook.\nThis can be done by running\nfind source/handbook -type f | xargs wc -w\nfrom the root directory of the repository.\nSubmit the word count to\nWordCounter\nfor conversion to a page count.\nTrainee maintainer issue upkeep\nPart of the\nmaintainer training process\nis to keep track of Merge Request that have been reviewed and writing down an assessment on the review in the maintainer training issue.\nManual upkeep of the maintainer training issue can be time consuming. There are tools that others have built to help with this task:\nhttps://gitlab.com/nolith/review-tanuki\nhttps://gitlab.com/splattael/traintainer\nhttps://gitlab.com/arturoherrero/trainee\nhttps://gitlab.com/alberts-gitlab/review-tanuki\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-dev-cli#maintainer-trainee-helper\nNote:\nWhen using these tools, avoid adding mentions to maintainers in existing comments. There is a\nknown issue\nwhere users are not notified by email when mentioned in an edited comment. It only generates a TODO which a maintainer may not use.\nHandbook Tips\nRefer to the\nHandbook Development section\nto learn more about the architecture, structure and how to edit the handbook locally on your desktop. For how to edit the handbook in your browser, refer to\nthe editing handbook page\n.\nwww-gitlab-com Tips\nPortions of the\nhttps://about.gitlab.com\nsite lives in the\nwww-gitlab.com\nrepo. The marketing website is maintained by the\ndigital experience team\nin their\nGitLab group\n.\nThe\ndata/*.yml\nfiles live in the\nwww-gitlab-com\nrepository, and are used by numerous sites including the marketing website and the handbook.\nThe documentation for the site itself is in markdown documents under the\ndoc\nfolder in the repo\n. If you are looking to do local development on the site,\ndoc/development.md\nis probably the best place to start.\nImage and GIF tips\nMany of the tips shown in this section require ImageMagick, an image manipulation tool. The installation is described in the\nImageMagick section\n.\nImageMagick\nImageMagick\nprovides the\nconvert\nCLI command which can be used to resize images, add drop shadows, edit GIFs, etc.\nOn macOS, install ImageMagick with Homebrew:\nbrew install imagemagick\nOn Linux, use your package manager:\nsudo dnf install ImageMagick\nsudo apt install imagemagick\nCreating GIFs\nWe have a\ndedicated section\nfor that in the handbook.\nResizing images\nImageMagick\nprovides the\nconvert\nCLI command which can be used to resize images. Our blog images do not need resolutions higher than 1920x1080. This saves bandwidth and makes the website load faster.\nThis example converts an existing image to\n1920x1080\nresolution and replaces it inline:\nconvert blogimage.jpg -resize 1920x1080 blogimage.jpg\nYou can also use percentage values for the\n-resize\nparameter. The\nconvert\nCLI command can do more things explained in the\ndocumentation\n.\nIf you need to convert multiple images, combine the\nconvert\ncommand with\nfind\n. Note that this replaces the images inline.\nfind . -type f -name\n'*.jpg'\n-exec sh -c\n'convert {} -resize 1920x1080 {}'\n\\;\nConvert HEIC to JPG\nTip: Modern macOS versions provide the Finder right-click menu\nQuick Actions > Convert Image\nwhich automatically converts an image to JPG. Use this method for quick UI conversions.\nImageMagick\nprovides the\nmogrify\nCLI command which can be used to convert the\nHEIC\nimage format to other formats like\nJPG\nwhich are accepted on all websites.\nmogrify -format jpg icloudphoto.HEIC\nIf you need to convert multiple images, combine the\nmogrify\ncommand with\nfind\n. Note that this creates new files and requires manual cleanup of\n.heic|HEIC\nfiles,\n-iname\nuses a case insensitive match.\nfind . -type f -iname\n'*.heic'\n-exec sh -c\n'mogrify -format jpg \\\"{}\\\"'\n\\;\nAn example shell alias can be found in\n@dnsmichi’s dotfiles project\n.\nAdd drop shadow to images\nInstall ImageMagick\nand use the\nconvert\nCLI command to add a drop shadow. The\n-shadow\nparameter may need adjustments on the dimension.\nconvert input.png\n\\(\n+clone -background black -shadow 80x20+0+15\n\\)\n+swap -background transparent -layers merge +repage output.png\nTroubleshooting\n2FA debugging\nIf 2FA stops working unexpectedly (no new phone or computer) it’s usually because of improperly configured date & time on either device.\nMake sure that “Automatic Date & Time” is\nenabled\non both devices.\nIf they’re already enabled try toggling them off and on again to force an update.\nIf this doesn’t work, request that IT Ops reset your 2FA setting.\nLinks for finding the settings:\niOS:\nGet help with the date and time on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support\nmacOS:\nIf the date or time is wrong on your Mac - Apple Support\nLinux (using systemd):\nsystemd-timesyncd - ArchWiki\nFor Android there’s no definitive link, since most vendors have different UIs for their settings.\nBut in the Settings-app, look for “Date & Time” and there should be a “Automatic Date & Time” toggle.\nCheck which process occupies a given port\nUsing Netstat\nNetstat is a command line tool which can be useful to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc. One of the most common uses for netstat during troubleshooting is to display a list of open ports listening for connections.\nsudo netstat -tulpn | grep -i listen\n[\nuser@gitlab ~\n]\n$ sudo netstat -tulpn\n|\ngrep -i listen\ntcp\n0\n0\n127.0.0.1:5000     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18948/registry\ntcp\n0\n0\n127.0.0.1:9100     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18841/node_exporter\ntcp\n0\n0\n127.0.0.1:9229     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18764/gitlab-workho\ntcp\n0\n0\n127.0.0.1:8080     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18980/unicorn maste\ntcp\n0\n0\n127.0.0.1:9168     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18808/puma 4.3.3.gi\ntcp\n0\n0\n0.0.0.0:80         0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18831/nginx: master\nIf you find a port already in use, you won’t be able to successfully start up a service or program that utilizes that same port. Options to resolve are:\nStop the service currently running on the needed port and confirm the port is no longer in use\nReview documentation to determine whether it is possible to specify an alternate port for either process (the existing one or your new service)\nKnown Port Conflicts\nWhen the GitLab Development Kit cannot start using the\n./run\ncommand and Unicorn terminates because port 3000 is already in use, you will have to check what process is using it.\nRunning\nsudo lsof -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P\nwill yield the offender so this process can be killed.\nIt might be wise to alias this command in your\n.bash_profile\nor equivalent for your shell.\nYou may also wish to add a function in your\n.bash_profile\n(or equivalent file for your shell) like this:\nfunction\nkillport\n()\n{\nlsof -i tcp:\n$1\n|\nawk\n'(NR!=1) && ($1!=\"Google\") && ($1!=\"firefox\") {print $2}'\n|\nxargs\nkill\n}\nwhich you can use like so:\n> killport\n3000\nand it will kill whatever process is currently using port 3000.\nTerminal\nDisplay current git branch in the console\nBy adding this small configuration you will be able to view the git branch that you are using currently.\nIf you are not inside a git repository, it only displays the username and the current directory.\nFor Bash:\nAdd the following lines in your\n.bash_profile\ngit_branch\n()\n{\ngit branch 2> /dev/null\n|\nsed -e\n'/^[^*]/d'\n-e\n's/* \\(.*\\)/(\\1)/'\n}\nexport\nPS1\n=\n\"\\u@\\[\\033[32m\\]\\w\\[\\033[33m\\]\\$(git_branch)\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ \"\nDoing the following, makes the changes to get reflected in you current terminal:\nsource\n~/.bashrc\nFor Zsh:\nOn macOS Catalina, ZSH is the\ndefault shell\n.\nBy installing\nOh My ZSH!\n, the git plugin is automatically loaded and shows the current git branch.\nAnother option would be:\nAdd the following lines in your\n~/.zshrc\nparse_git_branch\n()\n{\ngit branch 2> /dev/null\n|\nsed -e\n'/^[^*]/d'\n-e\n's/* \\(.*\\)/ (\\1)/'\n}\nPROMPT\n=\n\"%n@%d~%f%\\$(parse_git_branch) %# \"\nThe changes will show on the next terminal or immediately by running.\n. ~/.zshrc\nShell aliases\nUse command aliases in your shell to speed up your workflow.\nTake a look at\nthese aliases\nand others in\nSid’s dotfiles project\n.\nFor example, by adding the following to your\n.bash_profile\nor equivalent for your shell, you can just type\ns\nto checkout the\nmaster\nbranch of this website, pull the latest changes, and open the repository in Sublime Text:\nalias\ngco\n=\n'git checkout'\nalias\ngl\n=\n'git pull --prune'\nalias\ngca\n=\n'git commit -a'\nalias\ngp\n=\n'git push origin HEAD'\nalias\nwww\n=\n'cd ~/Dropbox/Repos/www-gitlab-com/source'\nalias\ns\n=\n'www;subl .;gco master;gl'\nAfter editing, you can just type\ngca\nto commit all of your changes, followed by\ngp\nto push them to the remote branch.\nIf you are using\nOh My ZSH!\n, you can add custom aliases shown below. You can freely define the file name, only the suffix\n.zsh\nis important.\nvim ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/aliases.zsh\nAn example can be found in\nMichael Friedrich’s dotfiles project\n.\nDelete local Git branches where remote branch was deleted\nIn order to delete local Git branches which are deleted on the remote server, you’ll need to combine the\n--prune\npull/fetch command with more commands.\ngit branch -vv\nlists all details of local branches, the followed\ngrep\nfilters for all marked gone in the default remote\norigin\nand prints the results with\nawk\n. This argument is passed into\ngit branch -d\n, and executed for all matching results.

It is hardware-based, and is typically deployed via a USB, NFC, or built into a device such as a MacBook’s Touch ID or iPhone’s Face ID. The standard is open and is maintained by the\nFIDO Alliance\n.\nWebAuthn\nis a component of FIDO2 that supports verification by web applications using public key cryptography. FIDO2/WebAuthn is the preferred method of 2FA and is highly recommended by GitLab’s Security Department. One of the points of 2FA is that while you are authenticating with a username and password for the first factor, a secondary factor should use a separate - or “out of band (OOB)” - communication channel for the authentication. FIDO2/WebAuthn devices certainly meet that criteria, better than all other methods. There are other 2FA methods\noutlined below\n.\nHow it works\nDuring the authentication process, you enter in your username and your password. On systems with 2FA enabled and using FIDO2/WebAuthn, the hardware token is queried. By pressing a button or tapping a sensor on the FIDO2 device, the FIDO2 device completes the authentication process in a cryptographically strong way. It is generally considered the most secure form of 2FA. It is also more convenient than manually entering codes generated by a\nTOTP\napplication.\nDuring the registration of the FIDO2/WebAuthn device, a public/private key pair is generated, with the public key being registered with the service you will be authenticating with, and the private key is stored on a secure chip in the device. When authenticating, after you’ve entered in your username and password, the device is queried via an encrypted message that can only be authenticated by the private key, so a button or sensor is pressed on the device to allow the query to be completed, and the user is then granted access to the system.\nFIDO2/WebAuthn devices\nYubiKey: The most popular FIDO2/WebAuthn device is Yubico’s YubiKey. There are a wide variety of sizes and styles of YubiKeys. Yubico (along with Google) helped develop the predecessor to FIDO2 standard (U2F) before it was moved to the FIDO Alliance. Most GitLab team members that have WebAuthn devices have a YubiKey. It should be noted that for a long time Yubico’s source code for its firmware was open source, but some of the newer versions of firmware are closed source. This has caused some concern in the security community, particularly those that prefer to use open source whenever possible.\nAre They Secure?\nYubiKey has been examined by the security industry at large, third party audits and by the Security Team. YubiKey’s are more than suitable for use within GitLab and work fine with FIDO2/WebAuthn-compatible systems.\nYubiKey has had a number of\nsecurity issues\nwhich are typically resolved quickly. They have a dedicated page for security advisories.\nIn rare cases, a security issue involving a hardware token arises that requires the hardware token to be replaced as a firmware update will not mitigate the issue. This happened with\nYubico in 2017\n.\nMost of the attack models that impact the FIDO2/WebAuthn tokens require physical access to the token itself. That is, the security advisories involve coding issues that can only be exploited via access to the token or the computer that the token is plugged into. This in itself makes the devices more secure.\nRecommendations\nWhile there are other hardware tokens that are also decent and will function with GitLab, some have limitations. The recommended solution for team members is Yubico’s YubiKeys.\nPlease fill out this\nform\nbefore ordering a YubiKey, as we may be able to provide a YubiKey via our group buy subscription.\nRecommended YubiKey models include the YubiKey 5Ci (for iPhone users) and YubiKey 5 NFC (for Android users).\nWhat GitLab team members need to keep in mind is that if you travel with your company laptop - either on a business trip, a trip to visit family and friends in another location but you intend to keep working, or just a trip to the local coffee shop - treat the token with the same level of care as a credit card. Do not leave it where it could be stolen.\nIf you are concerned about potentially losing your hardware token, be sure to add\nTouch ID\nand potentially a\nmobile device\nas an accepted authentication token. Sites following the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard should support multiple tokens. That way if one is lost or stolen, you can still login use another method. Currently YubiKey’s are limited to one per user, in the case of lost or damaged, please reach out in the #it_security_help Slack channel and we’ll assist you with a replacement.\nUsage of 2FA is mandatory for GitLab team members.\nOther 2FA Methods\nIn addition to\nFIDO2/WebAuthn\n, there are additional protocols used for 2FA. There is “cryptographic push”,\nTOTP\n, and SMS-based authentication (text message). Pluses and minuses to each are listed below.\nCryptographic Push\nThis is usually shortened to simply “push technology”. It is called “push” because during the authentication process, after you’ve entered your username and password, the service you are authenticating with automatically “pushes” a secondary authentication via a separate communications channel to a device you possess. This is usually your phone, and it is facilitated via a phone app that is specific to that process. During the registration process a cryptographically-secure key pair is generated, and the app uses that key pair to uniquely identify the Push as coming from the service you are authenticating to. Typically the app then either directly notifies you or you access the app, which will pop up a message asking if you were in fact trying to authenticate. Answer yes and the authentication process is complete. GitLab team members may be familiar with this Push method as it is used by\nOkta Verify\n.\nPush Caveats\nThis method is not quite as secure as a hardware token, as typically those devices stores data securely on the secure chip on the device itself. It is possible that the Push phone app is also storing secret data on the local secure chip on the phone, however the entire process is dependent on the service’s servers being up, and WebAuthn is more self-contained. But note that Push technology is still considered extremely secure, and once configured it is fairly convenient to use.\nTOTP\nTimed-based One-Time Password is fairly secure. This method involves a rotating value based off of a cryptographic seed that is used to uniquely identify communication between the service and the end user authenticating. The value is (usually) a six digit number that changes every 30 seconds, and during the authentication process after you’ve successfully entered in your username and password, you are asked to enter in the value. GitLab team members should use\n1Password\nto manage TOTP codes.\nTOTP Caveats\nThe main problem with TOTP is that during this 2FA process it typically involves the end user entering in all values through a single communications channel (usually a web browser). As this is the case, it is possible that an attacker could send you a fake web page for you to enter in your credentials, including your TOTP value. Granted, the attacker would have to be reading your replies and sending in all of your credential information extremely quickly and get the entire process completed with 30 seconds so the risk is greatly reduced, but it still exists. Both WebAuthn and Push are preferred over TOTP, but as long as you are the one initiating the communication and you are not clicking on a link in email, you should be okay.\nSMS\nOne of the more popular (and most common) methods of 2FA is SMS-based text messaging. It is similar to TOTP, but instead of using a locally-stored application to calculate the six digit number, the service you are authenticating to sends the six digits to you via an SMS text message. When you set up your account, you provide the service with your cell phone number so they know which phone number to send the six digits to.\nSMS Caveats\nDue to the number of caveats, SMS is only recommended if there is no other 2FA option available. Here are the main problems with SMS messaging.\nSMS is subject to the same phish-style attack as TOTP. The main difference is that some SMS-based authentication schemes time out after 60 seconds instead of 30, making the phish-style attack slightly easier for the attacker.\nThe information regarding your phone number is stored on a SIM card in your phone. If an attacker with physical access to your phone were to steal the SIM, they could impersonate you from their own phone. Of course they could do the same thing with your hardware token, however they would still need your username and password to use the hardware token. Unfortunately, calling up the service and asking for your password to be reset is often confirmed using SMS messaging, so with the possession of the SIM card, the attacker could pose as you. Again, if you treat your phone the same way you treat your credit card or cash, then this type of attack is minimized.\nAn attacker could contact your phone carrier, impersonate you and state you lost your phone, and set up a new SIM card. Unfortunately many times your account is protected with a security question such as “mother’s maiden name”, “favorite restaurant”, or some other simple question - all information that could be determined from a website that does family trees or via social media where you post pictures of your dinner.\nAn older attack known as “\nSIMJacker\n” allowed an attacker to send your phone an SMS message with a malicious payload that allows for direct manipulation of the SIM card itself. This attack still works on older SIM cards, although more modern SIMs are no longer vulnerable to this. Most of the known attacks using SIMJacker involved Latin and South America, the Middle East, Northern Africa, parts of Eastern Europe, and parts of Southeast Asia.\nIf You Must Use SMS\nThere may be services that only offer SMS as their 2FA solution, so in those cases it is better than nothing. If this is the case, there are a few things you can do to secure things ever so slightly.\nIf you have an old phone (5+ years old) you might want to consider upgrading the SIM to a recent one, as these are not susceptible to the SIMJacker issues.\nContact your phone carrier and ask if there are additional security measures to protect your account besides security questions, such as a PIN. In lieu of that, you could also try setting your mother’s maiden name or family pet security questions to something more, shall we say, unique (e.g.\nHdyla86kajDF64asdlui\n).\nSet a SIM PIN. For iOS devices, follow these\ninstructions from Apple\n. For Android devices, start with\nthese instructions\nbut contact your phone’s manufacturer website if the instructions do not fit your particular model.\nComplain to the service to offer more than just SMS for 2FA! The more complaints they get, the more likely they might be to offer more secure options.\nAdditional 2FA Concerns\nRemember the purpose of 2FA - it is a secondary authentication method, invoked after the primary authentication method has succeeded. You should only acknowledge a 2FA request if you personally have just successfully completed the primary authentication. An unsolicited 2FA request means someone has your password, and is in the process of trying to log in as you. This is why 2FA exists, to help protect your user account from attacks involving your password.\nIf you experience any such irregularities, please bring it to the attention of the Security Team.

If you link directly to the URL, people from outside the organization can request access, creating workload and the potential for mistakes.\nKeeping it organized\nIt is important that we not just throw files into random or general places in the shared Google Drives.\nDoing so makes it harder for others to find and work with the content.\nHere are some guidelines to organizing the Google Drive content:\nFirst by department (e.g. strategic marketing)\nthen by subject (e.g. analysts relations)\nthen by sub-subjects as deep as necessary (e.g. Gartner -> 2018 ARO MQ)\nUsing Google Drive\nFor starters, when your GitLab Google company account is created you automatically get a Google Drive with unlimited storage allocation in your own “home” directory (called My Drive).\nYou can get to it by:\n(optional) Login to your GitLab account in your browser (if you are using Chrome)\nOpen your web browser to\nhttps://drive.google.com\nIf you’re not already logged in as your GitLab account (Chrome users should be) then login to Google using your GitLab account\nThis will take you to your Google Drive (called My Drive) which is like your home directory.\nIf you create Google files using Google Apps and don’t specify where to store them, they will be put in this home directory.\nThis is great for storing your own working files.\nAs already stated,\nthis should never be the final resting place for shared files\nthat are meant to be used by the rest of the company (or beyond).\nExisting GitLab Google Drive repositories\nThere are a few Google Drive repositories of GitLab shared files (there might be more, please add if not listed here):\nUX Research Drive\n- This houses all findings from\nCustomer Discovery Meetings\nand raw, confidential materials from customers shared with Design, UX Research, Product and Customer Success. Distilled findings from\nUser Research\nare stored in the\nUXR_Insights repository\n.\nGitLab Marketing Drive\n- This houses all shared files from the entire Marketing organization.\nThe best practice is for sub-organizations to have their own directory inside this space (e.g.\nStrategic Marketing\n).\nSales Drive\n- This houses all the shared files from the Sales organization.\nThe best practice is for some sub-organizations to have their own directory inside this space (e.g.\nCustomer Success\n).\nGitLab Alliance Drive\n- This houses all shared files from the entire Alliance organization.\nThe best practice is for sub-organizations to have their own directory inside this space (e.g.\nPartner Discussions\n).\nHow do you use these? You don’t have to remember these URL’s.\nTo add these links to your Google Drive My Drive directory, do the following:\nMake sure you are logged into your GitLab account in Google Drive in your browser\nOpen the link of interest (from above) to go to that directory\nFind the directory path across the top (under the “Search Drive” field)\nFind the name of directory in that path that you want to add to your drive (e.g. Sales)\nClick on the down arrow next to it\nFrom the resulting pop-up menu, select “Add to My Drive”\nFrom now on you can get to that directory by first going to your drive (\nhttps://drive.google.com\n) and then opening that link\nAdding Google Drive to your Mac\nTo really make your Google Drive easier to access, you can have your Google Drive show up on your Mac Finder as a regular drive.\nWith this it is easier to store and view files such as videos, analyst reports (PDFs), etc.\nHere’s how to do this:\nMake sure you are logged into your GitLab account in Google Drive in your browser\nGo to your Google Drive (\nhttps://drive.google.com\n)\nClick on the “Settings” icon (Gear) to the right of the search field\nFrom the resulting menu, select “Get Drive for desktop”\nIt might pull up a new page/tab and use your personal login.\nIf it does this you won’t see “Download & install Drive for desktop” on the page.\nSwitch to your GitLab account.\nDownload and install\nGoogle Forms\nUse these\nGitLab branded form templates\nwhen creating internal or external surveys or forms.\nMake a copy of the form and only edit the copy; do not edit the template itself.\nReview\nwhat data privacy means at GitLab\n. Help participants make informed decisions by applying the following guidelines:\nFor external forms\n: State that any Personal Data collected will be processed in accordance with the\nGitLab Privacy Statement\n.\nFor internal forms\n: Ensure that the purpose for collecting data is stated under our\nTeam Member Privacy Policy\nand that this purpose is made clear to Team Members.\nDon’t make Personal Data form fields mandatory unless they’re absolutely necessary to achieve the processing; any inessential Personal Data collected should be through a voluntary form field.\nOnly process Personal Data for the reason in which it was initially collected e.g., if the Google Form collected traveler information, don’t then use that Personal Data to create a marketing list.\nGoogle Mail (Gmail)\nAuto-advance\nIf you use the archive function, you normally return to your overview.\nWith Auto-advance you can select whether to advance to the next or previous message.\n“Auto-advance” can be enabled from the Advanced section under Settings.\nThis reveals the Auto-advance settings in the General section under Settings.\nThe default setting of showing the previous (older) message is usually preferred.\nEmail signature\n-Set up an\nemail signature\nwhich includes your full name and job title so people can quickly know who you are and what you do.\n-It is also an option to add your\npersonal pronouns\nto your email signature.\nExample\nNote: You can copy and paste the template below to use it in your own signature.\nAlex Doe (they/them)\nFrontend Engineer | GitLab\nEmail signature if employed by our German entity\nDuring onboarding you may have been asked to set up your GitLab Gmail and your email signature using the\nfollowing example as a guideline\n.
