Group\nThe People Group at GitLab supports all GitLab team members through the complete team member lifecycle.\nWelcome\nWelcome to the People Group handbook! You should be able to find answers to most of your questions here.\nPeople Group Vision\nThe People Group works together to establish a high performance and results driven culture where a diverse and inclusive team can experience a meaningful career.\nWe support a culture that enables people to do their best work and advance their careers while fully contributing to advancing GitLab’s business results. We hire, promote, and recognize team members who best live our values.\nThe People Group strategy is aligned with\nGitLab’s Company Strategy\nthrough a focus on supporting GitLab’s ability to deliver on our FY26 Plan while setting the foundations to build a generational company.\nWe’ve published more information about how this vision translates to strategy and for People Group members and GitLab team members in this\ninternal-only presentation\n.\nConnect with us\nYou can also check out pages related to People Group in the section below. If you can not find what you are looking for please do the following:\nThe People Group\nholds several subprojects to organize the people group; please create an issue in the appropriate subproject or\ngeneral\nif you’re not sure. Please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to GitLab team-members. Similarly, if your question can be shared please use a public issue. Tag\n@gl-people-connect-team\nor\n@gl-hiring\nso the appropriate team members can follow up.\nPlease note that not all People Group projects can be shared in an issue due to confidentiality. When we cannot be completely transparent, we will share what we can in the issue description, and explain why.\nEmployment Issue Tracker\n: Only Onboarding, Offboarding and Transition Issue Templates are held in this subproject, and they are created by the People Operations Team only. Interview Training Issues, are held in the\nTraining project\nand created by the Talent Acquisition team. Please see the\ninterviewing page\nfor more info.\nPeople Operations\n; Please create a case for the People Operations team with any questions that do not seem appropriate for the issue tracker within\nHelpLab\n- choosing the applicable template/category applicable. For access requests regarding Google or Slack groups, please create an issue here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests\n. For questions that relate to Payroll, Expenses or Equity, please direct your question to the respective teams in HelpLab. Regarding questions for our recruiting team, including questions relating to access, or anything to do with Greenhouse, referrals, interviewing, or interview training please use the\n#talent-acquisition\nchannel.\nIf you need to discuss something that is confidential/private (including sensitive matters surrounding your team), you can open a\nHelpLab\nCase the Team Member Relations team. Any team member, regardless of location, can use this form to discuss a private sensitive matter.\nIf you need help with any technical items, for example, 2FA, please ask in\n#it_help\n. The channel topic explains how to create an issue. For urgent matters you can mention\n@it-ops-team\n.\nThe People Group: One Team Mosaic Video\nOne Team Mosaic Video\nIn general, the People Group is here to support GitLab’s\nmission\nby bringing top talent into GitLab, and then enabling team members to make meaningful contributions in alignment with our\nvalues\n.  Please don’t hesitate to\nreach out\nwith questions or ask for support!\nThe People Group works together as one team, made up of five departments: People Operations, Talent and Engagement, Total Rewards, People Business Partners, and Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB).\nDepartment\nTeams\nPeople Operations\nPeople Operations, Employment Solutions, People Compliance, People Tools & Technology\nTalent and Engagement\nTalent Acquisition; Candidate Experience, Talent Acquisition Operations and Insights, Sourcing, Talent Brand\nEngagement; Talent Development, Engagement, Talent Management, People Analytics\nTotal Rewards\nGlobal Compensation, Benefits, and Equity Strategy\nPeople Business Partners\nAligned to Engineering, Product, Sales, Marketing, and G&A, and Team Member Relations\nDIB\nNeed Help?\nIn Case of Emergency\nIf team members need emergency support from GitLab’s People team, please create a case in\nHelpLab\n. HelpLab is monitored during most working hours and is the centralized support platform for all people-related queries. Read more about our\nPeople Connect methods of engagement\n.\nWe trust team members to always use their best judgement when facing any emergency. Team members are encouraged to dial their country’s emergency services number for any critical and/or medical emergency. In the case that other team members are aware of a team member’s emergency (during a Zoom call for example) and wish to call that country’s emergency services on the original team member’s behalf, we do not recommend this as only certain People Ops team members have access to team member addresses and we would take on the role of communicating with emergency services, should this extremely rare situation arise.\nIn the event a team member is in an unsafe situation due to a natural disaster, please see the\nDisaster Recovery Plan\npage.\nHow to Report Violations\nAs stated in the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n, we have a section related to reporting violations. GitLab has engaged Navex to provide EthicsPoint, a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool, an anonymous ethics hotline for all team members. The purpose of the service is to insure that any team member wishing to submit a report anonymously about conduct addressed in the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\ncan do so without the fear of retaliation.\nIn addition to EthicsPoint, GitLab has engaged Lighthouse Services to provide an anonymous reporting hotline for all team members to submit reports regarding team member relations. Reports may cover but are not limited to the following topics: wrongful discharge or disciplinary action,\nsexual harassment\n, discrimination, conduct violations, alcohol and substance abuse, threats, improper conduct, violation of company policy.\nPlease note that the information provided by you may be the basis for an internal and/or external investigation into the issue you are reporting and your anonymity will be protected by Lighthouse to the extent possible by law. However, your identity may become known during the course of the investigation because of the information you have provided. Reports are submitted by Lighthouse to a company designee for investigation according to our company policies.\nLighthouse has a toll free number and other methods of reporting are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for use by team members.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.lighthouse-services.com/gitlab\nUSA Telephone:\nEnglish speaking USA and Canada: 833-480-0010\nSpanish speaking USA and Canada: 800-216-1288\nFrench speaking Canada: 855-725-0002\nSpanish speaking Mexico: 01-800-681-5340\nAll other countries telephone: +1-800-603-2869\nE-mail:\nreports@lighthouse-services.com\n(must include company name with report)\nFax: (215) 689-3885 (must include company name with report)\nIn addition to EthicsPoint and Lighthouse, please review the\nTeam Member Relations\npage. GitLab also offers a\nHarassment Complaint Form\nthat any team member may use to document any instance of any type of workplace harassment. Simply copy the form, fill it out with your information and send it to our Team Member Relations Specialist at\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n.\nHow to reach the right member of the People Group\nThis table lists the aliases to use, when you are looking to reach a specific group in the People Group. It will also ensure you get the right attention, from the right team member, faster.\nSubgroup\nGitLab handle\nEmail\nSlack Group handle/channel\nGreenhouse\nIssue tracker\nPeople Business Partners\n@gl-peoplepartners,\nPlease add the\npbp-attention\nlabel to any issue or MR that requires PBP review, collaboration, or feedback\npeoplepartners@ gitlab.com\n@peoplepartners\nn/a\nTotal Rewards\n@gl-total-rewards\ntotal-rewards@ gitlab.com\nHelpLab\nn/a\nPeople Compliance Partner\nTBA\nHelpLab\nTBA\nn/a\nPeople Operations Team\n@gl-people-ops-team\nHelpLab\n@people-ops-team\nn/a\nTeam Member Relations\n@atisdale-ext\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\nn/a\nn/a\nAbsence Management Team\n@lyndemeiers\nleaves@gitlab.com\nHelpLab\nn/a\nPeople Group Engineering\n@gl-people-engineering\nNo email group, create issues for People Engineering\nhere\n#peopleops-eng\nn/a\nhttps://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/-/boards/3941171\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\nNo alias yet, @mention the\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging Partner\ndiversityinclusion@ gitlab.com\nn/a\nn/a\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging issue tracker\nLearning and Development\n@gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development\nlearning@ gitlab.com\n#learninganddevelopment\nn/a\nL&D Issue Board\nTalent Acquisition\n@gl-talent-acquisition\nrecruiting@ gitlab.com\n@talent-acquisition-team\nn/a\nEmployer Branding\nNo alias yet, @mention the\nSenior Talent Brand Manager\nemploymentbranding@ gitlab.com\nn/a\nn/a\nCandidate Experience Specialist\n@gitlab-com/gl-ces\nces@ gitlab.com\n@ces\n@ces*\nTalent Acquisition Operations and Insights\n@gl-talent acquisitionops\ntalentacquisitionops@ gitlab.com\n@talent-acquisition-ops\n@talent-acquisitionops\nSourcing\n@gl-sourcingteam\nn/a\n@sourcingteam\nn/a\nPeople Analytics\nNo alias, create issues for People Analytics\nhere\nn/a\n@peopleanalyticstriage\nn/a\nPeople Analytics Issue Board\nPeople Group Program Calendar for Managers and Team Members\nOn\nthis page\nyou can find our People Manager Calendar and All Team Member Calendar. The goal of these pages is to ensure that team members and People Managers can plan ahead and have an overview of upcoming programs and timelines.\nCommunication on People Programs that require action\nEach quarter a Slack reminder will go out in #people-manager-and-above channel to review the next quarter calendar events. Each month shows Task, which outlines the people manager responsibility associated with the specific program, and (if applicable) highlights the Key Date. We will also leverage our Manager Newsletter and the Company Newsletter for broadcasting our programs widely.\nUpdating calendars\nEach month on the first Monday there’s a calendar reminder to update the calendars on that date. This calendar reminder includes People Business Partners and the DRI in L&D.\nAlso with sharing the calendars in the news letters People Business Partners and L&D will be tagged.\nThe goal of the calendar is to include information at least two quarters ahead of the current quarter. For questions about the updates to the calendars you can always reach out to People Connect.\nSupport provided by the Legal, Employment team to the People Group\nThe Legal-Employment team, collaborates with and provides support to the People team in many functional areas.\nEmail approval from the Senior Director of Legal, Employment is required prior to engagement with external counsel to allow for accurate tracking of costs.\nInvoices will be sent to Senior Director of Legal, Employment, for approval.\nWhen support from the People Operations team is required by the Legal, Employment team\nThe Legal, Employment team may require support from the People Operations team, for communicating a country specific legal requirement to team members, to consult with team members in an entity country if necessary or to arrange legally required contract amendments, to name just a few examples. As these matters may relate to individual team members or groups of team members, they are appropriately managed in a confidential manner.\nIf the Legal, Employment team makes a request for support or assistance from the People Operations team, the request should be formulated using a template (\nlinked here\n, though accessible internally only to Legal, Employment and the People Operations team).\nThe request should include\nall\nthe required detail and explanation to enable people connect to support, including:\nAn explanation of what is needed\nWhether there’s a timeline on the request (ensuring people connect are provided with as much lead time as possible)\nWhether all the information needed, has been provided, eg contact names, dual language translations if applicable, links to any relevant documents etc\nA note on whether an FAQ to share with team members is needed or whether people connect have enough information to answer any questions which might arise\nWhether there are any follow up actions for legal or for people connect\nA short explanation or summary (if necessary) or courtesy update for the managers of any affected team members\nWhether confirmation of completion is needed\nTo make a request, a copy of the template should be saved, filled out as above, dated and passed to Alissa Meeks/the People Operations Manager so the request can be assessed and assigned to a member of the people connect team for completion. Once assigned, the member of the People Operations team who will be assisting with the request should touch base with the member of the Legal, Employment team who has made the request, to confirm that the request is being worked on and so it’s easy to collaborate on finishing out the task.\nSupport provided by the People Operations team to the People Business Partner team\nMost tasks/requests from the People Business Partners for the People Operations team will be handled via a HelpLab. If a general query/question, the PBP may request guidance in the private\n#pbp-peopleops\nSlack channel. This is a private channel. The People Operations Team, will self-assign a task, within 24 hours and comment in Slack/HelpLab on the request to confirm.\nPeople Operations Responsibilities & Response Timeline\nPlease note that the source of truth for role responsibilites is the job family for the\nPeople Operations Team\n. The table below is meant to provide a quick overview of some of the core responsibilities for the team.\nPeople Operations Team\nResponsibility\nResponse Timeline\nOnboarding\n2 weeks prior to start date\nOffboarding\nImmediate action for involuntary & 24 hours for voluntary\nOrganizational Changes\nWithin 3 days of effective date of change\nLetters of Employment\nWithin 24 hours\nEmployment Verification\nWithin 24 hours\nAnniversary Emails\nFirst day of the following month\nHelpLab Queries\nWithin 24 hours\nProbation Period Notifications\nDaily (when applicable)\nContract Renewals\n30 days or more prior to team member’s renewal date\nExit Interviews\nDuring voluntary offboarding team member’s last week\nUS Unemployment Claim Management\nAs Needed and Audited Quarterly\nRelocations\nAs requested, usually completed 30 days or more prior to team member’s relocation date\nOther listed processes for the People Connect Team can be found\nhere\nEmployment Solutions Team\nResponsibility\nResponse Timeline\nCountry Conversions\nAs soon as approval is given by CFO.

The page includes information on accessing a team directory, requesting a letter of employment, mortgage forms, the companies reference request policy, ordering business cards, and changing your name in GitLab systems.\nAddresses\nFor the mailing addresses, see our\nvisiting\npage.\nFor the NL office, we use\naddpost\nto scan our mail and send it to a physical address upon request.\nReporting potential inaccurate LinkedIn Profiles\nGitLab does not actively search for LinkedIn profiles that have inaccurate information about being a GitLab Team member. However, there are instances where a profile is identified and there is question on whether the person is truly a GitLab team member. Here is the process for flagging a potentially inaccurate profile and the actions that the People Connect Team will do to confirm and potentially report a profile.\nTeam members should first check in Slack and/or on the organizational page to determine if the team member is a current GitLab team member.\nIf the team member cannot confirm the profile, team members should reach out to the People Operations Team via\nHelpLab\nwith the LinkedIn profile in question.\nThe People Operations team member will confirm in Workday that they are not/have not been a team member.\nThe People Operations team member will confirm with talent acquisition to confirm if they have ever been interviewed, made an offer or were declined.\nThe People Operations team member will reach out to the\nDeveloper Relations team\nto confirm if they are an active wider community member via the\n#developer-relations\nSlack channel, using the\n@devrel-team\ntag.\nIf they are a confirmed member of the wider community but not a team member, the Developer Relations team will reach out the profile and ask them to change their profile to match their GitLab involvement.\nIf they are not a current member of the wider community and talent acquisition has confirmed they do not have a profile in Greenhouse, talent acquisition will create a Do Not Hire profile.\nThe People Operations team member will report the account to LinkedIn via the\nReporting Inaccurate Information on Another Member’s Profile\nUsing Workday\nWe use Workday to maintain team member information.  All team members (all contract types) are in Workday.\nWorkday is managed and maintained by the People Tools and Technology team.\nSee our\nWorkday Guide\nto  learn more about how to use Workday.\nUsing Culture Amp\nAdministrative access to CultureAmp will be limited based on role and responsibility. There are 3 different levels of access:\nAccount Administrator access can manage account setting and team member data, create surveys and has access to all survey results.\nSurvey Creator administrator access can create, manage and design surveys, select participants and share results.\nSurvey data analyst administrator can export raw data from all surveys enabled for raw data extract.\nTo request access please open an access request with the type of account\naccess requested\nand the business need. You can assign the access request to Anesia Chan\n@anechan\nand Laura Janssen\n@Laura-Janssen\n(as backup) for review and approval. The default admin access will be the Survey Creator administration rights unless other access is specified. Please note that Survey Data Analyst admin rights will not be granted to team members outside of the People group with out permission from the Chief People Officer.\nIf you need support with a specific CultureAmp Survey, please complete this\nissue template\nto alert the People Analytics Team.\nTake Time Out to Learn\nAt GitLab, we believe that\ncareer growth is non-linear\n. In practice, non-linear career growth is an opportunity for team members to increase efficiency with new skills, develop as leaders with new responsibilities, and grow as an expert in their field.\nBut growth only happens when we make intentional time and space to learn.\nAs a People Group, we’re embracing this attitude of continuous learning together, with the challenge that, as a team, we can spend a total of\n300 hours\nlearning before the end of FY25 Q3! We encourage everyone to participate, spending approx. 2 hours per month learning something new, as a way to prioritize your development and use work time to uplevel and upskill.\nAt the end of the quarter, we’ll ask folks to self-report hours spent learning, and take a tally of total People Group learning hours.\nHere are a few ways you might spend time learning this quarter:\nCreate an IGP\nto track and monitor your growth goals\nUtilize the\nGrowth and Development Fund\nto engage in a class or conference\nOrganize a\njob shadow\nor\ninternship for learning\nto increase exposure and collaboration with different roles and teams.\nAttend an AMA or async Group Conversation, and contribute by asking a question.\nOrganize a discussion on your team about a shared topic (i.e. article, book, or podcast on a topic that is relevant to your team’s work)\nAttend a TMRG career growth event\nWe encourage everyone to have an ongoing conversation about career growth with their manager during weekly 1:1s. If this isn’t already part of your weekly check in, consider adding it to your agenda template now!\nInvesting in your growth is essential for both your individual success and the success of our entire team.
