The AOP is a three statement (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Statement of Cash Flow), non-GAAP bottoms-up plan that spans the current fiscal year. The revenue is forecast off of the bookings plan and expenses are planned at the headcount and vendor level.\nPurpose\n: GitLab’s AOP identifies GitLab’s company goals for the next year and strategies for achieving them. Provide guidelines to understand how much capital is needed to achieve these goals.\nGovernance\n: The AOP is approved by the board of directors every year.\nAnnual Planning Steps\nAlign executive team on strategic priorities\nPrioritize efforts aligned with three year strategy and annual themes\nSign-off on financial priorities for the year\nBuild out bottoms up integrated sales and marketing financial model with key assumptions documented so they can be tracked\nSet targets agreed upon by Product, Marketing and Sales\nReview product investments vs expected revenue generation\nSet expected amount for annual compensation increases\nSet targets for any contributors on a company based performance plan\nProvide a budget envelope to each e-group leader based on dollars that they can allocate into headcount and program spend\nGenerate the expense Plan based on a headcount list, TBH list, vendor level spend list\nHeadcount list communicated to talent acquisition, proposed vendor list communicated to procurement (future with Purchase Orders in place for existing vendors)\nGenerate and document key assumptions\nShow trending of key metrics as output of the Plan\nCapture Plans to drive key metrics\nCapture X-functional dependencies of execution\nDocument business plans for key drivers and initiatives of the year, e.g. new products\nRevise and update the annual sales compensation plan\nSet annual quota assignments for revenue producing roles\nFY26 AOP Milestones\nKey planning milestones are listed below. For a more detailed timeline and planning checklist please engage your FP&A business partner.\n2024-09-09 (week of) CFO/CRO Meeting: Discuss range of bookings, % expense, and agree on Q4 overattain/underattain scenarios impact\n2024-09-23 (week of) FP&A Meeting: Kickoff with Bottoms-up Targets with FP&A\n2024-11-15: Bottom-up Envelope submissions and Investment Area business cases are due\n2024-12-06: XFN eGroup Skips alignment on projects and dependencies\n2024-12-09 (week of) eGroup Offsite: FY26 AOP Alignment Meeting\n2024-12-12 Q3 Board Meeting: update planning progression and preview FY26 AOP\n2025-01-21 eGroup Meeting: update planning progression and Q4 Board Deck preview\n2025-02-12 eGroup ASYNC: FY26 AOP Final review\n2025-03-27 Q4 Board Meeting:  Final Formal Approval of FY26 AOP\nLong Range Outlook (“LRO”)\nWhat\n: The Outlook is a three to five year strategic and financial plan\nPurpose\n:\nIdentify and agree on long-term investments and capabilities that will position GitLab for success over the long-term.\nDetermine whether near-term priorities and funding need to change in order to achieve long-term goals and financial targets.\nOutlook\n:\nRefresh and reaffirm the company’s three year strategy.\nMake recommendations to identify and categorize strategic investment options which adjust our strategy.\nFocus on areas where decisions today meaningfully impact growth trajectory and/or investment needs.\nIdentify blockers to LT targets and drive to resolution, including incremental funding and/or reprioritization.\nFinancial plan\n:\nSet the financial envelope needed to achieve GitLab’s long-term targets, including bookings, revenue, P&L and cash metrics.\nEnsure healthy tension between funding investment needs and fiscal discipline / company efficiency.\nLaunch workstreams to resolve areas of tension before annual planning kick-off for the following fiscal year.\nPrinciples\n:\nFocus on identifying drivers which would bend or shift growth curves, for both top-line and expense\nIs a tops-down strategic and financial plan, not a bottoms-up operational plan\nCross-functional leadership buy-in required; not a finance-only numbers exercise\nPublic company benchmarking drive decisions around GitLab long-term targets\nGovernance\n: The Outlook is reviewed and discussed by the board of directors every year.\nLRO Updates\nThe LRO is refreshed on an annual basis, occurring shortly after the fiscal year plan is finalized. After the LRO is refreshed, there may be additional updates throughout the remainder of the year, on a quarterly and ad-hoc basis to determine whether near-term priorities and funding are needed in order to achieve long-term goals and financial targets.\nAs part of the quarterly and ad-hoc updates to LRO, the following are included:\nComparison to last LRO refresh across bookings, P&L, and cash flow\n6 quarter rolling forecast, including bookings, P&L, and cash flow\nComparison to peer benchmarking of similar revenue size for growth and efficiency metrics\nThe following are inputs in the LRO refresh and subsequent LRO updates:\nCapabilities and key investments across each business function (GTM, R&D, G&A), along with key cross-functional dependencies, risks/blockers\nGTM modeling: demand, productivity and supply capacity\nTotal rewards strategy\nExpense YoY and % of revenue targets, HC/non-HC spend by department\nBook to bill to cash collection assumptions\nSeasonality of bookings and expenses\nCash commissions\nPP&E/Capex purchases\nThe Corporate Finance team leads the LRO refresh and updates in collaboration with: e-group members to determine key investments, capabilities, and dependencies; GTM Finance team for sales productivity/capacity models, CTB, and bookings attainment; G&A Finance team for total rewards strategy, benefit assumptions; and the R&D Finance team to help inform on allocations, hosting/infrastructure expenses.\nBusiness Planning\nBusiness Planning Goal\nFor GitLab’s top growth drivers and new products, drive and document alignment between contributors to success. Writing a business plan drives clarity of thought and operations. Agree on governance models to manage initiative success and cross-functional accountability. At a minimum, each business plan should cover:\nExplain what an initiative is, why we should be focused on it.\nIdentify how each function will support its success, what are dependencies & risks.\nIdentify how we measure success, e.g. pipeline or bookings goals.\nBusiness Planning Details\nProduct plan\n- what are product features to ship, by when? What is committed and what is at risk? What are competitive considerations? If there are phases, what is in scope for each phase?\nPricing plan\n- what is the pricing strategy, what are open decisions, what is the margin structure?\nMarketing plan\n- how will product marketing and demand generation support the business plan.\nSales plan\n- what are the drivers of the sales plan? What is the quarterly Plan for  bookings? What are assumed attach rates, penetration rates, adoption rates, where is there uncertainty? What is the field enablement plan?\nServices plan\n- if applicable, how can enhanced services improve sales and adoption?\nOperational plan\n- what infrastructure do we need (fulfillment, IT, rev rec, legal, security, etc.)\nFinancial plan\n- gross margin and contribution to P&L, if applicable\nKey Contributors\nDriver: FP&A\nContributors\nProduct: lead PM(s), pricing lead\nMarketing: leads within both Product Marketing and Demand Gen\nSales: Regional VPs, RS&A, GTM FP&A\nSupport/Services\nAs needed: fulfillment, IT, accounting, legal, security\nApprovers / Informed:\nCFO, CRO, CMO, CPO, e-group\nReview and Governance\nContributors (above) agree on business plan and review with e-group members for feedback. Include proposed measurement plan (e.g. bookings or pipeline goals)\nOn a defined cadence (monthly or other), review product accomplishments vs. plan\nOn a defined cadence (monthly or other), review GTM measures of success vs. plan\nOn a defined cadence (quarterly or other), review P&L impact vs. plan\nEach quarter, refine success goals/metrics based on learnings to iterate on plan of record\nQuarterly & Monthly Cycle (incl. close, variance, forecast, guidance)\nGitLab’s FP&A team participates in a rigorous monthly close process.\nGoals\nSet clear deadlines to best support our accounting team and ensure timely delivery of information to executives\nAnalyze the performance of our budgets and forecasts against actuals, identify insights which enable our executives to better make decisions.\nUpdate our internal forecasts and update our investor guidance to prepare for the quarterly earnings call\nImprove forecasting methodologies and approaches to hold ourselves accountable and drive accountability to the business owners of the budget\nKey Definitions\nActuals\nWhat\n: Actuals are results that have been reported or exist in a system that is designated as a single source of truth for the item that is being measured. Each month accounting closes the month and financial results are recorded in our ERP system and are published in our financial statements. These actuals are compared to the Plan and our forecasts.\nForecast at\nFYyyyy-mm\nPurpose\n: In a dynamic high-growth business, GitLab’s needs may change through the year and we need to be able to predict what is going to happen.\nWhat\n: Forecast is a dynamic assessment based on current expectations of financial performance. The FP&A team will publish a monthly forecast for revenue driven by bookings and other key inputs and expenses driven by headcount and vendor spend. A monthly forecast does not extend the forecast period. For example in March 2020, the forecast will span from February 2020 to January 2021 with February actuals and a forecast for the period March 2020 to January 2021 — this will be called the (1+11) forecast.\nGovernance\n: The Forecast at\nFYyyyy-mm\nis approved by the Head of FP&A and reviewed with the CFO.\nNote: Prior to locking and archiving any version in Adaptive, Corporate FP&A will update the FX rates in Adaptive using\nGoogle Finance FX Rates\n.\nForecast at\nFYyy-Qx\nPurpose\n: In a dynamic high-growth business, GitLab’s needs may change through the year and we need a guidepost to hold business leaders accountable. We plan our expenses at a high level (e-group) and we expect this group to make prioritizations and trade-offs while remaining accountable against the plan parameters. By formally reforecasting quarterly, we can quickly evaluate and incorporate new initiatives into our forecasting model. That being said, we do follow an annual plan to set our goals and measurement for our top-level targets of revenue, profitability and expense management and ensure we continue to  meet any public guidance previously communicated\nWhat\n: Forecast at\nFYyy-Qx\nis a dynamic assessment based on current expectations of financial performance. The (3+9), (6+6), and (9+3) quarterly forecasts include revenue driven by bookings and other key inputs and expenses driven by headcount and vendors.\nGovernance\n: The quarterly forecast is approved by the Head of FP&A and reviewed with the CFO. It is then reviewed with e-group and the board of directors. e-group will be held accountable to the quarterly forecast for expenses.\nForecast Snapshots in Months 2-3 of each Fiscal Quarter\nPurpose\n: As a public company, GitLab needs to maintain a pulse on the P&L and key financial metrics. As a fiscal quarter develops, the snapshots inform the CFO and e-Group of our latest forecast and any adjustments from the previous snapshot view.\nCadence\n:\nIn Month 1 of the quarter\n: once in week 2 (the week before FP&A’s Month 1 forecast version lock)\nIn Month 2 of the quarter\n: weekly starting week 2 (the week before FP&A’s Month 2 forecast version lock)\nIn Month 3 of the quarter\n: weekly\nWhat\n: P&L snapshots track company metrics against Wall Street expectations related to revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share and enable GitLab to make in-quarter spending decisions based on the latest estimates from FP&A. The forecast snapshots are developed by FP&A and presented to the CFO in order to facilitate decision-making. The P&L snapshot follows the\nFinance Business Partners / Talent Acquisition Managers Headcount Forecast Interlock process\nand is delivered to the CFO via a slide deck tracking week over week changes in the snapshot. A summary is also communicated to the CFO and FP&A team via the #fpa_private Slack channel.\nMonthly FP&A Close Timeline\nThese dates are based on an 8-day accounting close. Corporate FP&A will confirm the close date with the accounting team and update the FP&A Close calendar in Google accordingly. For FY23, the target is to close by WD 5 with full consolidation (including tax entries, eliminations) by WD 10.\nClose timeline\nWD -3: AP Closed.\nWD -2: All accruals and JEs are due from FP&A\nWD -2: NetSuite Actuals for current month close included in Adaptive (performed by Corporate FP&A)\nWD 1: Headcount actuals loaded into Adaptive (performed by Corporate FP&A)\nWD 2: FP&A Flux distributed and is due one week after and/or one day after Accounting close\nWD 2: FP&A sends flash to the board (quarter only) - Bookings, revenue estimate and NGOI estimate\nWD 5: Revenue Closed.

The goal of this meeting is to do a comprehensive review so that finance leadership has a pulse on the business and signs off on the financials. Based on insights from variance analysis, the FP&A team makes actionable recommendations to the CFO and e-group to ensure continued performance to Plan/Forecast.\nThe variance analysis will compare department budgets with actual results and examine any material differences between budgeted and actual costs. Additionally, the actuals for expenses will be compared to the quarterly rolling forecast. The expenses are reviewed at the divisional department level, allowing GitLab to measure progress in meeting its Plan or rolling forecast. The team also evaluates the accuracy of forecasts and will make adjustments to the next rolling forecast.\nVariance and Flux Analysis\nThe study of differences between actuals and the Plan or Forecast. During the variance analysis processes the GitLab FP&A team analyzes and isolates any variance in question to the lowest level possible. The team reviews detailed items in order to identify the root cause of the variance. This could include transaction date, cost center, vendor, location, department or additional low level details.\nThe FP&A team takes the following into consideration while evaluating variances in relation to materiality thresholds:\nThe percentage size of the variance (i.e. what was the overall variance by percentage)\nThe correlation to other variance (i.e. did a immaterial difference in one place cause a material difference in another)\nThe inherent character of the variance (i.e. does the expense correlate to the traits of the business)\nThe FP&A team delivers an FP&A expense flux review document at each monthly close, documenting and quantifying business drivers for variance. The goal is two-fold:\nControl\n: ensure accuracy of actuals. Analysts should aim for 90% coverage in explanations, e.g. if variance is $100, aim to list drivers for net $80 of the variance for any particular intersection above threshold. List drivers in descending order of impact, followed by large offsetting drivers.\nInsights\n: leverage insights gained from closed month to inform rolling forecast. Changes in business strategy/model, new accounting policies, and refinements on forecast methodology should be documented and incorporated into the new forecast.\nPerformance Indicator\n: Variance percentage\nWe measure our team performance based on our forecast accuracy, also known as variance percentage. Variance percentage is defined as the difference between actuals and Plan or rolling forecast. We calculate it as follows:\nVariance Percentage (Plan) = (Actuals - Plan)/Plan or\nVariance Percentage (Forecast) = (Actuals - Rolling Forecast)/Rolling Forecast\nVariance analysis should address any inputs or additional requests from the last\nVariance meeting\n, as applicable.\nTypes of Threshold and Materiality\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) does not provide definitive guidance in distinguishing material information from immaterial information. Therefore, GitLab uses a percentage based approach for defining materiality thresholds and can be found below. The Plan vs Actuals vs Forecast Sisense dashboard provides the data for the threshold analysis via a color coded legend.\nOur goal is to have revenue and EBIT variance percentage within +/- 2% on a quarterly basis.\nKey accounts and expenses by division should be within +/- 2% versus Plan or rolling quarterly forecast every quarter.\nVariance Meeting with EVPs\nEVPs are held accountable to meet the budget in dollars that they are given. The budgets typically are broken into headcount and program spend. Each finance business partner will run a meeting with their Finance leader and the EVP to review the past month. The information should be presented as timely as possible. Given the accounting close is 8 days, the team is asked to use pre-close numbers for the review to increase the speed of information. During the meeting, the Finance Business Partners will review GitLab results in addition to a detailed overview. Each division can expect to review the following during the monthly meetings:\nCompany results\nSpending OpEx vs Plan\nDivisional level review including an executive summary with relevant insights and watchpoints\nLast month vs plan/rolling forecast\nProjection for the current quarter\nDetailed variance details that helps the EVP understand the financial picture of their expenses\nDiscuss upcoming changes to financial processes that EVPs need to be aware of\nDiscuss upcoming changes to help Finance Business Partner update the rolling forecast\nDiscuss any budget lines that underspent and if money can be reallocated before quarter-end. Noting that converting program dollars to headcount is usually difficult as it impacts future periods.\nAt quarter end, review the upcoming  quarter vs Plan for the Division and for each department on the quarter\nFollowing the month-end close, the Finance Business Partners will create a variance deck and distribute department income statements to the related budget owners and the e-group members. Each department is then responsible for comparing these reports, which contain actual costs, to the budget. Departments, with guidance from the Finance Business Partners, should analyze their data and if necessary, discuss items of interest and take appropriate action. Any questions regarding the cost data should be discussed with the Finance Business Partner.\nQuarterly FP&A Close Timeline\nThe close timeline for each quarter follows the timeline above for monthly close and includes additional key dates and processes:\nGuidance\nOverview\n: We provide quarterly guidance on key metrics of the business. At the earnings call for the previously concluded quarter, we provide guidance for the following quarter and the full fiscal year. For example, at the Q1-FY23 earnings, we will provide guidance for Q2-FY23 and updated FY23 guidance. We report guidance based on dollar ranges (except for weighted average shares outstanding which is given as a share estimate).\nWe provide quarterly guidance on the following metrics:\nRevenue\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (NGOI)\nNon-GAAP Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP EPS, or NGEPS)\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding (WASO)\nCadence\n: Following accounting close, the Corp team provides guidance proposals to the Head of FP&A for review. Following that review and any necessary iteration, the Corp team meets with the CFO and the Head of Investor Relations to review the guidance proposal, iterate, and finalize guidance figures.\nDeliverable\n: The deliverable to the CFO and the Head of Investor Relations is a slide deck with the proposed guidance range, implied guidance for the following quarters, comparable company benchmarking, and sensitivity analyses. The guidance proposed is also included in the Audit Committee and Board of Director deck materials.\nQuarterly Earnings Process\nAs a public company we share financial results publicly after the close of each fiscal quarter or fiscal year.

Details allow TA to open a requisition in Greenhouse\nBackfill requisition requires separate approval (below)\nHiring Manager create/review Job Family\nTalent Acquisition partner opens requisition in Greenhouse\nFormal approval to open role\nWhen a requisition is opened in Greenhouse it is routed for approvals. The job approval requires approvals from Total Rewards, FP&A and Department Lead (VP+)\nThis allows the FBPs to check all details of the role and ensure consistency to SSOT Hiring Plan\nIf role details in Greenhouse do not reconcile to Hiring Plan in Adaptive, FBP will reach out to both TA and HM to resolve discrepancies\nFP&A is also a required approval on all job offers (before the role is officially filled). This approval allows FP&A to confirm details of the job offer and ensure reconciliation to Hiring Plan\nRun kick-off (aka Intake) with Hiring Manager\nFP&A and TA discussed and agreed upon the above process. This SSOT process ensures consistency in Hiring Plan execution\nPlanned Positions\nPlanned Positions include all Net New positions to existing GitLab active employees.\nHiring Plan Approval of any Planned Positions are from:\nAnnual Operating Plan (AOP) cycle\nRLoA cycle for any incremental roles through the year\nRequisition Release\nHiring Manager create/review Job Family\nOpen requisition in Greenhouse\nFormal approval to open role\nRun kick-off (aka Intake) with Hiring Manager\nBackfill Positions\nBackfill Positions include all positions created due to departure or termination of an existing employee.\nHiring Plan Approval of any Backfill Positions\nWhile GitLab strongly believes that a HM should be able to backfill each role upon termination and/or departure, HM should check with his/her leadership to discuss and decide whether there are changes to the backfill role\nIf changes are approved by leadership, please work with your FBPs to update details of the backfill positions.\nFBPs evaluate change and ensure neutral dollar impact from role change/update\nFBPs brief Corporate and request new/remove PID if applicable\nUpon final decision, FBPs enter details into Adaptive and update Hiring Plan\nRequisition Release\nUpon a resignation, Hiring Managers (HMs) submit official notice to Workday (WD)\nWD backfill notification will send to both TA and FBPs\nWD backfill notification will allow Recruiter to create a backfill issue\nAll final decisions and details of the role(s) will be documented in the backfill issue\nRecruiter can create a requisition in Greenhouse and move to the next step of the process\nHiring Manager create/review Job Family\nOpen requisition in Greenhouse\nFormal approval to open role\nRun kick-off (aka Intake) with Hiring Manager\nHiring Plan Process\nBoth PID and GHPID are created and maintained by FP&A team as unique identifiers in Hiring Plan\nCreating a Position ID (PID)\nAll PIDs are created by the Corporate FP&A team and are tied to Headcount Forecast (including Hiring Plan)\nFP&A Position IDs increase visibility and accuracy for headcount forecasting (count and dollars) and simplify & provide transparency on modeled headcount (attrition and backfill).\nPID is an unique identifier for positions assigned by Corporate to\nall\npositions in Hiring Plan\nAdd/remove/exchange positions requires FBP approval via existing process, e.g. RLOA or rolling forecast and submit change request Google Form\nhere\nPositions reconciled regularly, e.g. monthly before each rolling forecast lock\nPosition ID follows “\nFIN-Fiscal Year-0000 (4-digit PID code)\n” as naming convention\nFor example, if a role is opened in FY24, the PID is “FIN-FY24-0000”\nCreating GHPID\nAll GHPIDs are system-generated by a FP&A internal Google Sheet\nGoogle Sheet GHPID generator is maintained and audited by Corporate FP&A weekly\nFBPs will refer to GHPID generator and assign GHPIDs to all approved positions\nFuture State:\nCorporate will migrate GHPID generator to Workday (pending on Workday/Adaptive integration and Workday Position Management)\nGHPID is updated during weekly forecast interlock and regular forecast cycles.\nStarting FY25 Annual Operating Planning, GHPID will follow “GH-Fiscal Year-Department Internal ID-0000 (4-digit GHPID code)”\nas naming convention.\nFor example, if sales and/or marketing is hiring a role, the GHPID will be\"GH-FY25-100-0001\".\nWhen a role is pushed into next fiscal year, the GHPID won’t change\nWhen a role is re-allocated into a different department, the GHPID won’t change\nEach GHPID is unique to each opening of a requisition\nDepartment internal ID\nis from Netsuite as SSOT and consistent to Adaptive department code\nOnce a number has been used in Greenhouse for a job, it can not be reused. If the role is a future role and has been deleted, but was never input into Greenhouse, the FBP can use that number for its replacement or a different role since it was not used yet.\nMaintaining Hiring Plan\nFP&A team is the owner and maintainer of SSOT for GitLab’s Hiring Plan\nObjective of this control is to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of Hiring Plan\nCompleteness\n: all approved positions are assigned with PIDs and GHPIDs\nAccuracy\n: no PID and GHPID is assigned to duplicated or deprecated positions\nConsistency\n: ensure Hiring Plan in Adaptive is fully reconciled to details in Live Interlock Google Sheet and details in Greenhouse requisition\nPIDs and GHPIDs are stored in Workday Adaptive (Adaptive) and are required fields in Hiring Plan\nFBPs will update Hiring Plan weekly in Adaptive & update TA through weekly Interlock.\nFBPs may update their Headcount Forecast on a more frequent basis (more than weekly) depending on their individual department’s business needs\nUpdating Hiring Plan could require adding new roles, deleting roles, trading off roles, or adding backfills\nHiring Plan audit and reconciliation is performed by Corporate, including\nWeekly GHPID audit and reconciliation through TA and FP&A Interlock\nMonthly PID audit and reconciliation through monthly forecast lock\nCorporate will reach out to FBPs if noticing any discrepancies and resolve them before monthly forecast lock\nFinance Business Partners / Talent Acquisition Managers Forecast Interlock\nPurpose\nThe FP&A team and Talent Acquisition Managers collaborate to ensure understanding and implementation of the most up-to-date view of forecasted headcount-related expenses. This interlock enables GitLab to respond quickly and make live decisions through a weekly P&L forecast and the\nrolling list of asks (RLOA) process\n. This process also ensures alignment and accuracy of headcount forecasts when FP&A locks its annual plan and monthly rolling forecasts. This process also tracks company metrics against Wall Street expectations related to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Please see the\nHeadcount Metrics and Processes page\nfor definitions and key metrics.\nHeadcount Live Dashboards\nThe Hiring Plan data is divided into four headcount forecast templates, one for each cost center with Cost of Goods Sold allocated among Sales and R&D. The data and analysis from the four templates roll into the Summary file. The four templates can be found in the\nHeadcount Live Summary Dashboard\n.\nCadence / Process\nUnless otherwise noted in the HC Forecast calendar or communicated via Slack, the interlock process occurs weekly as follows:\nBy noon (PST) Monday\n, the Corp FP&A team downloads the data from Adaptive and refreshes the headcount forecast templates. Talent Acquisition also refreshes the headcount forecast templates with the latest data from Greenhouse.\nBy end of day (PST) Wednesday\n, the Talent Acquisition Managers and Recruiters review their respective roles line by line and make adjustments and comments related to expected start dates and other role details provided by the Finance Business Partners. If no indication is made for a specific role in the headcount forecast template, Talent Acquisition signals that the current indication is reasonable and indicative of a 50/50 “most-realistic” forecast. The Talent Acquisition Managers also pay close attention to any recruiting capacity restraints within any given quarter. In order to maximize transparency and understanding of any changes, the Talent Acquisition Managers and Recruiters provide comments (e.g., wrong GHP ID, rejection of an offer, delay due to business decision, etc.) for specific roles.\nBy end of day (PST) Thursday\n, the Finance Business Partners update Adaptive with their best estimates of the start dates of all planned personnel for the forecast period based on the input from Talent Acquisition in the headcount forecast templates. This reflects a 50/50 “most realistic” view of headcount expenses/timing.\nBy end of day (PST) Friday\n, the Corp FP&A team sends a P&L snapshot to the CFO incorporating any headcount forecast adjustments. Note: P&L snapshots are not provided during accounting close.\nCommunication\nCommunication related to the interlock takes place in the #fpa-ta_headcount_forecast Slack channel. All parties involved in the interlock are also granted access to the “HC Forecast” Google Calendar.\nDeliverables\nThe Finance Business Partners and Talent Acquisition Managers collaborate to provide the most current and 50/50 “most-realistic” view of headcount-related expenses. This is done through the interlock process in the headcount forecast template and is ultimately uploaded into the Planned Personnel sheet in Adaptive.\nThe inputs loaded into Adaptive are then used to provide the CFO a weekly P&L snapshot in order to facilitate in-quarter spending decisions and ensure the company tracks vs.  guidance and consensus expectations.\nExpense Controls\nThe primary mechanism to ensure efficient spend of company assets is the\nProcure to Pay\nprocess, and specifically completion of the\nvendor and contract approval workflow\nprior to authorization. The procurement team or your finance business partner can assist with questions related to this process.\nThe second mechanism is the budget vs actual review to determine reasons for variances vs plan. See the section on\nVariance Meeting with CFO\nand\nVariance Analysis\n.\nAdaptive Planning\nA manual on how to update and maintain Adaptive integration can be found\nhere\n. This document is maintained by the Corporate FP&A team.\nAdaptive Quarterly Roadmap\nThe current Adaptive roadmap can be found\nhere\nWe expect to transition roadmap and requests into GitLab issues by Q2-FY23.\nCorporate FP&A will host Adaptive intake sessions with the larger FP&A team to intake, align and prioritize current and future projects.\nRolling List of Asks (RLOA)\nIntent of RLOA Process\nReinvest back into the business when company expects to beat expectations\nEnable e-group and leaders to make informed and fast business decisions\nCreate a repeatable and transparent quarterly process into incremental investments\nExpectations for Business Partners\nYour FP&A partner will assist in maintaining a rolling list of asks (RLOA).
