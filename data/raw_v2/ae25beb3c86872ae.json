We are a team designed to drive\nresults for customers\nthrough both inbound and outbound strategies. Our structure is designed to maximize efficiency, responsiveness, and creativity in our outreach efforts.\n1. Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) - Inbound Focused\nKey Attributes:\nFast Response Time\nGlobal Coverage\nAlignment with Marketing for SLAs and Feedback on Campaigns\nDefined and Prescriptive Inbound Processes\nRound Robin Assignment Rules\nTalent Incubator for BDR Teams\nOur Inbound-focused SDRs are known for their swift response times, ensuring global coverage and alignment with marketing initiatives. They operate with defined and prescriptive inbound processes, utilizing round-robin assignment rules. Additionally, the SDR team serves as a talent incubator for our Business Development Representatives (BDRs).\n2. Business Development Representatives (BDRs) - Outbound Focused\nKey Attributes:\nAlignment with SAEs/AE & Sales Leadership\nCollaboration with Field Marketing + ABM\nStrategic Account Planning and Research\nTargeted and Creative Messaging\nTalent Incubator for Sales Teams\nOur Outbound-focused BDRs excel in strategic account planning, research, and delivering targeted and creative messaging. They work closely with Sales Account Executives (SAEs), Account Executives (AEs), and Sales Leadership. The BDR team\nThe Sales Dev Index\nPlease follow the table below to quickly find the most relevant place for what you’re looking for. You can also use the searching method\nexplained here\nto increase your searching capabilities.\nOur handbook page has contributions from a diverse team. To help you efficiently find answers, we highly suggest that you\ncmd+F\nthis page as a best searching practice.\nTry searching for as many permutations of what you’re looking for. For example, if you want to find information on lead scoring search for keywords like\nscore, scoring, lead, leads, scoring\n. Remember that\ninformation retrieval\nis a core GitLab value, and a skill that will make a big difference in your careers.\nIf you can’t find what you’re looking for please reach out to a member of the Sales Dev Ops team and we’ll help you find it, or update the handbook to include it!\nPage\nWhat you’ll find\nHow-Tos Page\nQuick information on finding your leads and accounts, actioning your inbound/outbound pipeline, creating Sales Accepted Opportunities (SAOs), and any other main process that you’ll work with on your day-to-day.\nRoE, FAQ and KPIs Page\nAnswers to the most common questions around career progression, rules of engagement, general expectations from the role, opportunity credit, ramping periods, lead routing and compensation.\nTanuki Tech Page\nAnything related to your ongoing enablement as part of the Sales Dev team.\nThe Sales Dev Knowledge Vault\nInformation and knowledge that can help to improve your skills. Includes managerial-level processes, manager or team member onboarding, and tool walkthroughs.\nHow we typically help the teams we work with\nWhat is your role and ask?\nHow will the Sales Dev Org help\nI am Field Marketer, and want to have people invited to my event\nWe typically work with the FM process outlined on the issue template called\nFM-BDR-Collaboration-Template\nthat can be found\nhere\n, but are always eager to collaborate in making your events more successful, if your ask is not covered in the template linked above, please write to us on the #sales_dev_global slack channel and we’ll jump in to assist.\nI am an Account Executive, and want to nominate accounts for outbounding efforts\nOur end-to-end outbound process\nis here\n. The easiest way to automate your workflow is to find the field BDR Prospecting Status on the SFDC Account record, and select the Queued option from there. The BDR team will then pick it up and research it for their outbound pipeline.\nI am an Account Executive, and want to check the state of accounts, or quality of prospects, in my territory\nOur BDR team uses a set of\n1:1 dashboards\nthat consolidate all relevant resources in one place. Our BDR team typically uses these on 1:1s with the Sales team to facilitate better account and territory planning.\nI am a Field Marketer, or Account Executive, and want to suggest that the SDR or BDR team uses my messaging for reaching out to prospects or clients\nWe have a\nquick process\nfor creating new flows on Groove, our messaging tool. Even though the BDR or SDR are the ones typically creating these requests, we always welcome collaboration with other teams so feel free to log your own request directly if you’d like.\nI am a Sales Manager, and want to gauge the quality and progress of the SAOs provided to my team.\nWe have a robust set of pipeline\nprogression dashboards\nthat break down results in a lot of granularity. We also have a structured path for handing off opportunities from the SDR/BDR teams to the AE team that you can use to measure adherence to qualification criteria and next steps.\nOur Slack Channels\nChannel\nSlack Handle\nMain Channel -

These views are split per use-case for your convenience. The KPIs for managing these leads are thoroughly outlined in our\nSLAs page\n.\nSDR Lead Views\nView\nDescription\nS1 - High Priority View\nThese are leads that are marked as High Priority because of some high Propensity To Purchase indication.\nS1 View\nThese are your net new leads that have scored high enough to reach MQL status.\nS2 View\nThis is a view of your existing leads that also have an associated phone call so you can easily reference your callable pipeline.\nS3 View\nQualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls. Each lead needs to either be active in a follow-up Flow, have an active task, or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date.\nBDR Lead Views\nView\nDescription\nFY26 B1 - My Leads, Action Needed\nIncludes any leads that we have committed to follow up on ASAP. These are our highest converting leads and are a mix between High Priority and MQL’s PTP is now part of our scoring so there may be leads in there that have MQLd due to PTP so you’ll have to click into the lead to see more. High Priority leads belong to a High Priority campaign - you can find which one at the bottom of the page in the campaigns section.\nFY26 B2 - AWA leads w/ LIM\nIncludes leads in your name and that match to your Actively Working Accounts. It’s best to sort these by Last Interesting Moment Date and consider the Lead Classification Score when deciding which one to add to Groove Flow. We do not surface leads that were added to Flows in the last 14 days.\nFY26 B3 - Change Owner AWA’s (Clone)\nThis view however allows you to see leads that may not have been moved into your name because at the time, they did not meet criteria. These could be bc: the leads were in lead statuses of: Accepted, MQL, or Qualifying when you moved the account into Actively Working since leads with those statuses should stay with the owner currently working them.\nFY26 B4 - My HT Leads W/ Phone\nThis view should be used when either you do not have enough daily call tasks in Groove to hit your daily KPI or when your team wants to do a call blitz etc. It allows you to easily pull into Groove and create additional call tasks for your leads currently in high touch flows.\nFY26 B5 - My Qualifying Leads\nThese are leads in qualifying status which means some sort of two-way engagement happened between you two.\nFY26 B6 - 6QA Imported Leads\nleads in your ownership related to accounts that have just hit 6QA status in this view. 6QA means the account has been shown to have high intent signals and has similar signs to other accounts that have purchased from us. We have brought in appropriate titles from ZoomInfo so that when you move the 6QA account into Actively Working, you have some leads all ready for sequencing.\nFY26 B7 - AWS Prospecting Last 7 Days\nThese are leads in qualifying status which means some sort of two-way engagement happened between you two.\nFY26 B8 - AWA Leads w/ no LIM\nThese are leads in Recycle Queue status with Last Interesting Moment dates older than 12 months which means they were previously engaged but have been inactive for an extended period.\nContact Views\nView\nDescription\nB1 View\nIncludes MQL’s, Hot contacts that require quick follow up. NOTE: Not all of these contacts will be in your Actively Working Accounts list as all contacts where you are BDR Assigned on account are in your ownership, so please ensure that you set the account BDR Prospecting Status to Actively Working if you engage in discussions with the contact so that you can continue working the account and expand your outreach, otherwise any new lead MQLs for the account will route to the SDRs .\nB2 View\nContacts related to Actively working accounts that you can choose to add to Flow\nB3 View\nActive leads in HT Flows that have a phone number - to help with call downs\nB4 View\nQualifying leads. Contacts that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either on email or through phone calls. Each contact in this status needs to either be active in a follow up Groove Flow, have an active task or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date.\nAccount Views\nView\nDescription\nB1 - My BDR Assigned accounts (clone)\nCustomize to show accounts where you are the BDR assigned.

This includes checking the database for duplicate records, as well as referencing against our\nRoE\n.\nOpen the lead you want to investigate and press the\nFind Duplicates\non the top of the lead’s record.\nCheck through all the records that show up, from leads to Acccounts. Make sure to search for\nDomain\nand\nLast Name\nif the data you have seems incomplete.\nCheck the\nMatched Account Info\nsection on the lead record.\nFor SMB leads, if there’s a matched account where the type is\nCustomer\n, please press the\nConvert\nbutton at the top of the lead page and match this lead to the existing account.\nIf there’s not a customer record but you find an existing open opportunity, update the\nLead Status\nto\nRecycle\nand\nRecycle Reasons\nto\nEvaluating.\nFor Universities/Education leads (non-US Pub Sec), work as regular lead if technical contact.\nIf there’s a matched account, check if the field\nBDR Prospecting Status\nis\nActively Working\nand, if so, reroute the lead to the team mentioned on the\nBDR Assigned\nfield.\nIf the existing account is not marked as\nActively Working\n, check for duplicate leads or contacts and merge if necessary while keeping the oldest\nInitial Source\n.\nIf the\nCompany Address\nfields on the lead record do not match your research online of the company, please update the\nAdmin Company Override fields\nthat are found in the\nLead/Contact Review Admin\nsection. As a further fail-safe step, you’ll be asked to verify that this due diligence is done prior to converting this person to a new account.\nIf there’s no matched account, but there’s another lead at same company that has the\nMQL\nstatus, assign both leads to the owner with the earliest\nMQL Date\n.\nIf there’s no matched account, but there’s another lead that has the\nAccepted\nor\nQualifying\nstatus, assign the new MQL to the owner of the accepted/qualifying leads.\nBDRs receiving leads not associated with\nActively Working\naccounts must assign back to SDR team or chatter mktgops support.\nQualified leads associated with “Actively Working” accounts are routed to BDR assigned to the Actively Working Account.\nTelco and Finserv Routing\nFor leads that connect to companies that operate in the Financial Services (AMER only) and Telecommunications (EMEA only) industries. We have a seperate routing process that supercedes all of our current\nRules of Engagement\n.\nOnly named TELCO/FinServe accounts are rolling up to the TELCO/FinServe territories. If a new account is a subsidiary of an existing carved company, it will need to be assigned to the AE owning the ultimate account. If it is a totally separate entity then it can be allocated to the regional AE. If a lead comes in that is related to a TELCO/FinServe account, it must be assigned to the BDR assigned on the account.\nCompany Address Based Routing Information\nIn\nthis video\n, a member of the Marketing Ops team goes over the Company address fields and how they are used for Accounting Routing and Opp assignment.\nIf you need to do edits to the database by merging leads together for any of the above steps, please reference the videos below for an explanation.\nSDR Territory Map\nMerging Leads\nHow to Merge Leads Together\nHow to Merge a Lead and a Contact Together\nChatter Guide for Troubleshooting\nIf you’d like the assistance of another person or team, you can use SFDC chatter on the lead record. Please reference the guide below:\nProblem\nWho to Chatter\nA SMB/MM Contact Request and the account is a customer\nChatter the Account Owner and inform them of the context of the message.\nA BDR receives an MQL Lead that is not from an Actively Working Account\nChatter @mktops\nIf you feel a lead has been misrouted\nChatter @mktops\nThere is a Duplicate Account\nChatter Sales Support and ask them to merge the accounts.\nAn Opp has moved into Stage 1 but has Incorrect Data\nChatter your manager who will then reach out to someone in Sales Dev Operations.\nUnclear Territory Assignment\nChatter an AE from each of the potential territories.\nRequesting SAO Credit on an Opp\nChatter Sales Dev Ops or the Director of Commercial Sales Development.\nAccount is in Restricted Status\nChatter the SAE and ask permission to reach out.\nCleaning Poor Leads\nLastly, Every so often you may be assigned a lead that has no value to GitLab and is not worth keeping within our database. Qualities that define these types of leads include:\nStep\nDescription\nIdentify leads with no value to GitLab\nLook for leads with characteristics such as incoherent or obviously forged information, or email addresses from temporary domains that self-terminate.\nVerify lead removal necessity\nEnsure that the leads meet the criteria for removal and are unlikely to provide any value to GitLab.\nAdd leads to the SPAM DELETION Salesforce campaign\nAdd the identified leads to the SPAM DELETION campaign in Salesforce. Make sure to be 100% certain about the removal, as this process is irreversible.\nNote campaign membership, not status\nRemember that only campaign membership matters for this process, so the campaign member status used when adding to the campaign does not affect the removal process.\nUnderstand the permanence of lead removal\nRealize that leads removed through this process cannot be recovered by MktgOps, making the removal permanent. Exercise caution when initiating lead removals.\nBe aware of the removal schedule and exceptions\nNote that the removal process occurs daily at 12:05 am PDT via Marketo. For unscheduled removals, request assistance in the mktgops Slack channel but minimize requests.\nRequest email domain blocking if necessary\nIf you observe multiple leads with the same domain, create an issue with Marketing Ops to add the domain to a block list, preventing future occurrences.\nHow to action your leads\n1. Determining High-touch or Low-touch Groove Flow usage:\nDetermine if the lead qualifies for a high touch or low touch Flow.\nHigh touch Flows are for higher-quality leads and require more personalization and touch points, including phone calls and LinkedIn Connect requests. This should be the majority of your pipeline.\nLow touch Flows are typically automated and run for a shorter period of time. You can use Low-touch for leads where a phone number cannot be found online or in our databases, or where their contact information is incomplete and cannot be enriched by our tools, or through manual research. Low touch should only be reserved as the last resort.\nResearch the appropriate Groove collections for relevant collateral to be used. Most typically our High-Touch Collection or Low-Touch collections.\nCold-Calling and Email Checkbox\nBefore calling any Lead or Contact, BDRs must ensure that the\nDo Not Call\nbox is unchecked.  If you speak to any anyone, including prospects and existing contacts, who ask you not to call them again, you must check this box. However, please do not delete the number as we need to know which number requested not to be called again. For any individuals who are opted-in to email, you may ask them if they wish to be called. If they express a desire to be called, you are then permitted to uncheck the\nDo Not Call\nbox if it was previously checked.  Also, if an individual expresses independently via email a wish to be called, you may uncheck the\nDo Not Call\nbox.  This email must be present in SFDC as proof of your authority to uncheck this box.  You cannot send email requests to individuals not opted-in to email asking whether they would like to be called.\nOur cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.\nTo be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:\nDifferent Geographical Business Cultures\nPersonality Type as per the DISC model\nIndividual’s Role and Responsibilities\nBusiness’ Needs and Objectives\nAn unsubscribe link must be included on every email sent by a BDR, including responses to a prospect or contact. Please reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help for the recommended language that should appear at the bottom of each outbound email.\nDo Not Call and Do Not Email Automations\nLeads with certain criteria will be automatically labeled as\nDo Not Call\nand or\nDo Not Email\nshortly after loading into our database. It’s understandable this can be frustrating for certain territories. Please keep in mind, the criteria behind this automation has been set in order to follow local law. Please see the\nInternal GitLab handbook\nfor more information on the triggers.\nHow to Enroll to Groove by Clari\nGroove\nis a tool used to automate emails in the form of flows. Users can track open rates, click-through rates, and response rates for various templates, and update flows based on these metrics. Groove also helps to track sales activities such as calls. All emails/calls/tasks made through Groove are automatically logged in Salesforce with a corresponding disposition. See below for instructions on how to enroll leads in Groove:\nGo to your SDR views in Salesforce and select the lead you want to add to a flow.\nPress\nAdd To Groove Flow\n.\nWork from the Groove extension on Chrome to select the flow you want to enroll the lead in by using the labels feature.\nOnce the first step of a Groove flow is complete, the lead status will automatically change from\nMQL\n,\nInquiry\n, or\nRaw\nto\nAccepted\n, marking that you are actively working on this lead.\nWhen a lead responds to your outreach, their status will automatically change from\nAccepted\nto\nQualifying\n. Manage these leads from your S3 and B5 lead views.\nIf you are not actively qualifying this lead further, manually change the status to\nRecycle\n, so the lead is returned to the Marketing recycle pool and isn’t stuck in your\nMy Qualifying\nview.\nIf you speak with the lead by phone and are qualifying them, manually change the status from\nAccepted\nto\nQualifying\n.\nWhen reviewing your\nQualifying\nview, add leads with no recent activity, no active tasks, and not currently in a flow into one of our follow-up Groove Flows under the\nMOTION: Follow-Up\ncategory.\nTasks and pipeline management can be done via Groove’s\nActions View\n.\nIn the Actions View, review the list of leads assigned to you by navigating to the play-icon button for each to start their corresponding action for the day.\nIf a lead completes a Groove flow without responding, the lead status will automatically change to\nUnresponsive\nor\nRecycle\nafter seven days of no response.\nManually change the lead status if you do not use a Groove flow to reach out or if you need to disqualify a lead (e.g., for bad data).\nIf you mark a lead as\nInactive\nor a contact as\nInactive\n, signifying that this person no longer works at the company, any running Flow will automatically be marked as finished.\nIf your leads are being reassigned to the\nInquiry Queue\n, it’s likely due to a scheduled cleanup job in Traction that updates\nStatus = Inquiry\nto\nInquiry Queue\n. To resolve this, add your leads to a Groove flow.\nNote:\nThe cleanup job runs daily at 10:30 PM EST/EDT.\nGroove Labels\nWe’ve organized our\nGroove Labels\ninto key categories like\nindustry, region, play/motion\n, or\nlanguage\nto help you efficiently retrieve the most appropriate content quickly.\nHow to Use Groove Labels\nOn the top-hand of the\nflows page\n, access the filter menu and search per\nlabel\n.\nIndustry\n: Industry-specific labels that group flows per similar sectors.\nRegion\n: Flows organized by geographical regions, enabling you to target leads with more region-appropriate cadences based on local business culture.\nPlay/Motion\n: Each label within this category represents a specific sales play or marketing motion. These labels help you align leads with the appropriate strategy based a company’s and customer’s identified value-drivers.\nLanguage\n: Language-based labels to ensure that you can easily find non-English collateral for our global audience.\nGroove Templates\nWe’ve organized our\nGroove Templates\nin the same way as our\nGroove Labels\n—by\nindustry, region, play/motion\n, and\nlanguage\n—to streamline your outreach efforts. These templates provide consistency and efficiency, and need to be created regardless if you’re sending one-off messages or using templates to structure a flow.\nWe currently have one master SalesDev folder for saving templates, please ensure that any templates that you create are saved under that folder, and tagged with the appropriate collection as per the logic outlined above.\nIn both cases, it’s essential to tag your templates with the appropriate collection name to maintain consistency and help others easily locate them for future use.\nNew Groove Flow creation\nPlease follow the instructions on\nthe Groove handbook page here\nImplement Measurement Clarity and Decision Velocity\nBy dogfooding GitLab we have a structured and simplified cadence of quantifying Flow creation in terms of value and results without limiting agency.\nMaintain Equal Contributions in a Shared Reality\nBy maintaining a Single Source of Truth (SSoT) we give the best possible forum for cross-functional collaboration with specific guidelines\nFollow Up Groove Flows\nFor SDRs and BDRs managing leads in their qualifying views, we’ve created\nthis video\nto guide you through using follow-up Groove Flows.\nPlease visit the Groove Flows page and search for the tag\nMOTION: Follow-up\nto review your available options.\nWhite Glove Event Follow Up Flows\nFor more personal events, such as Executive Roundtables, there may be more detailed Last Event Notes that include a request to involve people who interacted with the prospect at the event. For these situations, we have specialized white glove Flows. These can be found by searching for the tag\nMOTION: White Glove\nThe goal of these Flows is to reach out to the prospect quickly and to include our SAEs/AEs in the conversation.\nThe first step is to add the prospect to the Flow. Then, customize the first email step to include the individuals mentioned in the Last Event Notes. You can also delay the first email to allow time for feedback from the SAE/AE if needed.\nNext, send a screenshot of the first email step to the SAE/AEs who will be CC’d. Explain that this strategy allows them to engage with more personalized messaging if the prospect remains unresponsive.\nNote:\nThere is a generic task on Day 12 to follow up with the SAE/AE if there has been no engagement. The goal is to keep them informed and work together to engage the prospect.\nHigh Priority Campaigns and Leads\nA High Priority Lead is a lead that is related to a high priority campaign. Any campaign checked as High Priority will have any members that relate to Actively Working accounts marked as High Priority irregardless of their lead status. These will show up in the BDR’s B1 priority view. Check the high priority timestamp and high priority reason fields in salesforce to understand why a lead was marked high priority.\nIf you need to move a lead out of high prioriy without contacting them you can\nuse this flow.\nThis flow is one generic task for you to complete that will move the lead to accepted status and remove the high priority check.\nTranslating Groove Flows\nFor translating flows to different languages, other than English, the Sales Dev Team will be partnering with our GitLab Localization team. Please follow the grid below to see who the Sales Dev DRI for each language is and the level of support that the localization team can provide. The localization team can provide translations for languages outside of their normal range if given a two weeks heads up. The requestor should know that in these cases, the translation quality may not be as accurate as for the localization team’s regularly supported languages. When you are ready to request translations from the localization team please create an issue in the\nLocalization Issue Tracker GitLab Project\n.\nLanguage\nSales Dev DRI\nLocalization Team Support?\nLocalization DRI\nPreferences\nAMER Spanish\nKenia Rodriguez\nYes but only International ESP\nVendor Support\nN/A\nAMER Portuguese\nLeo Viera\nYes Brazilian PT\nVendor Support\nN/A\nEMEA Spanish\nCamilo Hernandez Murillo\nYes but only International ESP\nVendor Support\nN/A\nEMEA Portuguese\nTati Fernandez\nNo\nN/A\nN/A\nDutch\nMarije Konink\nNo\nN/A\nN/A\nFrench\nErwan Régnaud\nYes\nMaud Leuenberger\nNo emojis, Hello Last Name instead of First Name\nGerman\nRiko Pfennig\nYes\nHendrik Breuer\nVery Formal, No Emojis\nIndonesian (Bahasa)\nAletha Alfarania\nNo\nN/A\nN/A\nItalian\nFrancesca Gianfiglio\nYes\nVendor Support\nN/A\nJapanese\nEri Nitani\nYes\nMegumi Uchikawa\nN/A\nKorean\nKayla Ko\nNo\nN/A\nN/A\nMandarin (Taiwan)\nAletha Alfarania\nNo\nN/A\nN/A\nHow to Change your Email Signature\nYou must change your email signature\nin Terminus\nin order for your signature to save. If you only change your signature in Groove or Gmail your signature will revert back within 24 hours.\nSteps to change your signature\nLog into Terminus\nusing your GitLab Google Account\nAfter logging in click on the Terminus logo in the top left corner\nNext click the menu item for “Email Experiences”\nFrom there you can edit your signature and see a preview of it on the right side of your screen.\nHow to follow our FO Outbound Process\nBDR outbound lead generation is done by prospecting to companies and individuals who could be a great fit for our product. Prospecting is the process of finding and developing new business through searching for potential customers with the end goal of moving these people through the sales funnel until they eventually convert into customers.\nBDRs will work closely with their dedicated SAE or AE to choose which accounts move into “Actively Working”. Together they will build a strategy for those companies. It is crucial that outreach is very intentional and strategic. When reaching out, we want BDRs to offer value and become a trusted advisor, ensuring a positive impression is left whether there is current demand or not.\nThe FO Outbound process is split in four phases, which should be followed on a weekly basis to ensure a steady outbound pipeline in alignment with our internal KPIs. To manage this process we use a set of datapoints on SFDC on the account-level that are marked under the section “BDR Comments”. Please reference the guide below on an explanation on how they work.\nBDR Field\nUsage\nBDR Prospecting Status\nDenotes whether an account is currently actively being worked, marked queued for future review, is restricted from being worked, or has been worked in the past.\nActively Working Start Date\nGets populated automatically when an account is moved to Actively Working (AW) Status and the rest of the field is populated, marking it a valid AW account.\nBDR Account Research\nA space for the BDR to document their research and rationale for prospecting this account. A template is provided in step 5 of the guide below.\nBDR Next Steps\nA space for the BDR to use as working notes for the current status of prospecting the account.\nBDR Account Strategy\nA categorization system that we use to high-level denote what motion or play was used in trying to engage with an account.\nBDR Recycle Date\nAutomatically populated two months out from the AW date. Can be manually changed if the BDR chooses to continue working an account.\nWorked in FY Reason\nAutomatically populats when an accounts get moved to Worked in FY prospecting status. If an account needs to be added to this status before it’s appopriate date, this field needs to be manually populated with one of the choices provided.\n6QA Acceptance Status and 6QA Dispute Reason.\nWhen an account has been automatically moved to Actively Working and Showing Intent, as per the 6QA project outlined\nhere\n, you will need to review the account and change this field to Accepted or Disputed within 48 hours. In case of choosing to Dispute the account you will need to choose a Dispute reason. Use\nAccount in open opportunity\nif there is an SDR with an active open opportunity. These accounts will be flagged on the 1:1 Dashboard for you to review with your manager and other collaborators.\nPlanning Phase (4-5 hours/week)\n1A. Create a set of achievable objectives\nThese goals should be based on what you know you can achieve when focusing on First Order accounts. It is particularly important to know your equation so you can map your activities to specific outcomes and goals in a predictable way.\nThe main objective you should be focusing at is to measure and plan what activity is required to achieve or increase the amount of First Order meetings.\n1B. Map your objectives to your data\nResearch your territory to identify the true First Order (FO) accounts, ensuring no other subsidiaries have licenses, verifying there hasn’t been a lost renewal in the past 180 days, and confirming there are no open opportunities. The goal here is to vet your TAM (Total Addresable Market) so that you can start matching cohorts of accounts with the objectives that you’ve outlined in the previous step. Indicatively, you can export these accounts to a Google Sheet, or other SSoT of your preference, for tracking since these accounts will be marked as Actively Working at a future step further down the process.\nUtilizing these accounts, create an outreach strategy and plan for the upcoming month and quarter. This strategy should include considerations such as the number of accounts to include in Flows per week and per month, the quantity of prospects from these accounts to add into Flows weekly, whether you intend to target specific personas, if you plan to employ targeted messaging, whether Flows will be used for high-priority targets, and the messaging approach you will implement. As previously mentioned, knowing your equation is important for your planning here. Please refer to the sheet linked above to determine your exact metrics.\nAccount Research Phase (4-5 hours/week)\nDuring your research phase for accounts to include in your Flows, thoroughly investigate and document pertinent information, which may include the below.\nYou can use the Claude prompt here to help you automate part of this process.\nIdentifying new strategic hires - ZoomInfo Scoops, Company Website or LinkedIn\nDiscovering recent job openings in DevOps - Company Website or LinkedIn\nMonitoring for security breaches or threats - Tech News Websites\nScanning for relevant news articles - Tech News Websites\nGathering intelligence on competitors - ZoomInfo or Cognism Insights\nExamining future plans, such as digital transformation initiatives - ZoomInfo Scoops, Company Website or LinkedIn\nNoting recent company acquisitions - ZoomInfo\nInvestigating LinkedIn connections - LinkedIn\nIdentifying instances of GitLab usage by employees or as a past customer - SFDC or 6Sense\nExploring 2nd and 3rd-degree connections - LinkedIn or 6sense Persona Heatmap\nSeeking mentions of DevOps - ZoomInfo Scoops or 6Sense Timeline\nReviewing relevant 10K reports or financial disclosures - Company Website\nThis comprehensive research will provide valuable insights for crafting effective outreach strategies further down the funnel. Regarding account research, in addition to our B2B database toolstack, we also use 6Sense to pre-qualify the accounts that should be considered for our pipelines since 6Sense scores accounts based on their market and profile fit.\nThere are two ways utilize 6Sense:\nThrough the SFDC iframe integrated dashboard (mandatory for FY24Q3)\nThrough the 6Sense Platform (optional for this Quarter)\n2A. Using 6Sense through the SFDC dashboard\nNavigate to SFDC\nOn the main tab with options (leads, accounts, etc), click on the “+” sign\nSelect 6Sense dashboards, you can also click “customize my tabs” to add the 6sense dashboard\nto your homepage permanently\nOn the 6Sense dashboard, click the cog icon on the top right\nOn “Search by User” select “BDR Assigned” and add your name\nOn “Other filters” select “Salesforce Account fields” and type “BDR Prospecting Status”\nOn the “BDR Prospecting Status” field, select “Actively Working”\nThe dashboard will now display the top actively working accounts in your name. Do note that these are only accounts that we currently have on our database, while you can find greenfield accounts by visiting the SaaS platform (instructions in section 2B). Section 3 below explains how you can review and utilize this data.\n2B. Using 6Sense through the SaaS platform\nNavigate to 6Sense through Okta\nOn the left-hand bar, click on the Segments tab\nYou will find all of the relevant resources for BDRs and SDRs on the first 5 folders. These folders can be used as per the table below.\n(In each folder you will find a saved template that can be cloned and edited for your individual territories.)\nFolder\nUsage\n1. AWA’d Accounts\nThese segments will display the top accounts in your current actively working list according to 6Sense intent data. By manually investigating each of those accounts you will be able to uncover further prospect engagement data, and adjust your strategy in converting this account. This report has the same functionality as the SFDC dashboard outlined in step 2A.\n2. Non-AWA Greenfield Accounts\nThese segments will display the top accounts in your territory that we do not have on our SFDC database. These accounts should be manually investigated and considered for adding to your outbound pipeline. Note that we have approx. 15% of our TAM on our SFDC database, while these reports are an automated way to identify great accounts from the other 85% of the TAM in your territory. Please note that the Sales Dev Ops team is here to work with you to generate these reports, as the particularities of our Sales Territories require some editing with the filters. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us so we help you work through these.\n3. Non-AWA SFDC Accounts\nThese segments display the accounts that currently hold on our database that display high 6sense intent scores, but are not part of your actively working list.\nAfter choosing the type of report you’d like to work, please follow the steps below:\nSelect the template in each of the BDR folders that starts with the prefix “-[TEMPLATE]”.\nOn the title, add your name or territory as suggested by the naming convention. Please make sure to delete the Prefix “-[TEMPLATE]”.\nClick on “Edit Segment”.\nFor folders 1 and 3, you’ll see a prompt on one of the filters to add your name to the “BDR Assigned” Field.\nFor folder 2, you’ll see a prompt to add your region to the “Address: Region” field. Do note that based on your territory there are other datapoints like “Address: City” or “Address: Country” that can be used.\nAfter having done the edits on steps 4 and 5, press “Save Changes”. Make sure that you’ve updated the naming convention accordingly and click “Save As New Segment”.\n3. Manual Research on Accounts\nNo matter how efficiently we’re trying to use our toolchain, these tools are still prone to error, and manual research is required to best shortlist the prospecting lists that cross-referencing will provide.Manual research will also provide additional context that can be used to hyper-personalize your outreach to your prospects.\nFor each account that you want to investigate, start with SFDC to make sure that there are no duplicate accounts. The report templates in 6Sense should exclude existing customers or accounts actively prospected, but we cannot automatically exclude accounts that have a different naming or domain on salesforce (ie. GitLab and GTLB)\nThe importance of diligent manual research will lead to the below efficiencies:\n→ Better use of time in the long-run by making sure accounts are indeed within your segment and territory, or are not duplicates.\n→ Avoiding unnecessary RoE conflicts by making sure there are no hidden parent accounts that would cause SAO ownership to be re-assigned to other segments in the future.\n1. To double-check the account on Salesforce:\nSearch for the account name on SFDC.\nSearch for the account email domain on SFDC.\nSearch for the account website domain on SFDC.\nSearch for the Account’s HQ address, along with any regional business unit address.\n2. To hyper-personalize your messaging:\nPlease follow the steps below to understand how to research the data provided on 6Sense, and to cross-reference this data with our internal knowledge base so that you create your account strategy accordingly.\nUnderstand and utilize 6Sense data: Each segment has an accounts tab that displays all the accounts that correspond to this segment. This view can be shortlisted further by using the three analytics tabs as all datapoints in these tabs is clickable.\nPredictive Analytics\nfilters accounts by their propensity to buy. This data can be used to split prospecting efforts between high-priority outbound campaigns and low-priority awareness campaigns\nBehavioural Analytics\nfilters accounts by the intent/value-driver that they mostly focused on. This data can be used to split accounts into specific value-driver focused campaigns.\nProfile Analytics\nfilter accounts by the demographic of each company in terms of location or size. This data can be used to run location-specific campaigns.\nSearch for past opportunities on SFDC\nCheck the qualification Questions section\nCheck the unqualified reasons by the AE team\nCheck past email communication on the activity records\nSearch for the account record on SFDC\nCheck Account Rank notes by the AE team\nCheck the PathFactory, ZoomInfo, Marketo integration tabs\nCheck their product usage information (if applicable)\nCheck their LAM Dev Count\nSearch for relevant leads on SFDC:\nCheck for past communication\nCheck for Last Interesting Moment and how it connects to their title and lead source to determine their compelling events\nCheck for Web Activity on Marketo and PathFactory to gauge past interest\nCross-reference with External sources\nSearch LinkedIn Insights for company growth, financials and recent news\nSearch company webpage for recent news, career openings or specific technologies used\nSearch online sources like newsletter or crunchbase\nCross-reference the above with HighSpot\nCheck for relevant playbooks based on company size\nCheck for relevant messaging based on persona\nCheck for relevant pain-points based on value driver\nExecution Phase (5-10 hours/week)\nExporting Accounts and Leads to SFDC, and adding to your Outbound Pipeline.\nAfter having manually shortlisted the accounts that are applicable to your campaign, the next step is to determine the relevant prospects per account and export them to SFDC. It is important to add accounts to your outbound pipeline so that AEs and other SDRs/BDRs know this is an account that is already being touched, and to avoid confusion or multiple people approaching the same prospects. Before moving an account into “Actively Working Status”, make sure there have been no MQLs or opportunities created from that account within the past 30 days, and there are no leads from that account in Qualifying status with activity in the last 30 days or with a future task date set. If you are not sure, double-check with the related AE, SDR or BDR.\nTo determine which prospects to enroll per account, please follow the steps below:\nIdentify the idea value drivers to be used for the account’s pain-points through your manual research, as outlined above.\nDetermine which personas would most benefit from the specific value drivers by using our CoM documentation on HighSpot.\nRun queries for the specific titles on ZoomInfo, and export to CRM.\nYou should explore the specific personas you intend to target, such as: VPs, Directors, Developers, Security, Architecture, DevOps, DevSecOps, Procurement Officers, and IT Buyers.\nDetermine the number of prospects you plan to add to Flows, with a minimum of 25 per day. Utilize LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo or Cognism to identify these personas within your target companies.\nIn Step 7, compile the selected prospects and create LinkedIn Sales Navigator lists for each persona. Save these lists for future use.\nTo export to CRM, please follow the guidelines below:\nClick the Export to CRM button on ZoomInfo\nThat’s it\nNo, really.\nTo fill in the BDR fields, please follow the guidelines below:\nUse the\nformat found on this template\nCopy-Paste the Structure to the BDR Account Research field and populate accordingly.\nPopulate the BDR Next Step Date to be at the end of the account’s Flows length (typically one month out)\n6. Maintaining a clean pipeline, and using BDR fields for cross-functional collaboration\nTo review your current pipeline, along with any leads with next steps, please refer to your segments dashboards by going to SFDC > Dashboards and searching for Watch and Help.\nTeam specific variants of these dashboard components will also be found on your team’s dashboard. These dashboards will give you a bird’s eye view of what actions are required from to maintain a clean pipeline, in terms of: i. Accounts with BDR fields past due ii.\nProspects with Flow steps past due\niii. Prospects that have been moved to Qualifying status but have not had any outreach since.\nHow to Get SAO Credit and Create Opportunities\nQualification criteria is a minimum set of characteristics that a lead must have in order to be passed to sales and become a Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAO), these are split into\nInbound and Outbound Criteria.\nAs an SDR or BDR, you will work to connect with inbound/outbound leads that you get a response from to obtain the applicable information required. This information is tracked on the qualification criteria on the\nLEAD, CONTACT, and OPPORTUNITY\nobjects in Salesforce. In order to obtain an SAO, you will need to have the\nrequired information\nfilled out on the opportunity including documented 2-way communication on the Contacts in the Opportunity. Professional Services opportunities are not credited to sales development, these need to be passed straight to the account AEs for them to qualify.\nThe full walkthrough of how to create a SFDC opportunity is\nlisted here\n.\nPlease note that, in addition to the main requirements listed on this link, the Sales Dev org memebers (both SDRs and BDRs) are expected to fullfill the\nInitial Engagement Channel\nas a mandatory qualification field, before being allowed to create an opportunity.\nThe Initial Engagement Channel field is found in the “Lead/Contact Review Admin” section on leads and will be availible when creating an opp for contacts.\nWhen do I create an Opportunity?\nYou have scheduled time with AE/SAE to speak with the prospect:\nIf you are scheduling time with an AE/SAE to speak to the prospect based on a qualifying conversation you have had with the prospect, an opportunity needs to be created and placed in stage 0. On the opportunity, all “required qualification” fields need to be filled in.\nYou have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.\nIf you have a meaningful two-way communication with a prospect, but have not had the required qualification criteria to move to the Sales team, you can create an opportunity under your name so that you better track your warm conversations. These opportunities may also be used for better collaboration with your team, as they can be reviewed and brain-stormed upon during team meetings.\nIf the lead is from a new account confirm their number of employees and HQ location for routing purposes\nWhen you create an opportunity with a new account please confirm the number of employees and headquarters location of the account with the prospect. You can do this through email or in your call notes if you speak to them over the phone. The reason for this is to make sure the newly created contact and account are routed to the correct teams after you convert the lead. Please cross reference the employee count and hq location with one of our data tools (ZI, Cognism, Sales Nav) to make sure what the prospect said was accurate. If the employee count is around 200-300 people be extra dilligent as the new SMB to MM employee cut off is 250 employees. We do not want the Sales teams to have to debate whose opportunity it is.\nWho owns the opportunity at this point?\nYou have scheduled time with AE/SAE to speak with the prospect.\nWhen you have entered the qualification criteria onto the opportunity, and have received calendar confirmation from all parties for the intro call with sales, you will change ownership to the AE/SAE. After you have saved opp owner, you will add yourself to the BDR/SDR field. The opportunity will remain in stage 0.\nYou have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.\nAt this point, the opportunity will be in your ownership but you can not have yourself listed in the Business Development Representative or Sales Development Representative field. There is a validation rule that will not allow the opp owner and the SDR/BDR representative field to be the same member.\nWhen will it be credited as an SAO?\nAfter the AE/SAL meets with the prospect to verify and supplement qualification criteria, they will move the opportunity into Stage 1 Discovery. The AE/SAL is expected to move the opportunity into the correct stage within 48 hours of the meeting reflected in the “Next Step” date field. The opportunity close date defaults to the last day of the quarter, however it’s good practice to set the date at least 90 days out from creation date.\nIf an opportunity has incorrect data after it has moved into Stage 1 - Discovery, please Chatter your manager about the required changes, they will then Chatter someone from Sales Dev Operations (Ramona, Panos, Ed) once final changes are agreed upon. No one else from Sales Dev can edit opportunities once they are in Stage 1, so please try and ensure you have all the information on the opportunity before you ask the AE/SAL to accept it.\nIf the opportunity is for a new group of users in a Large account where sales is working on a large “central” opportunity, then your opportunity should be merged to that opportunity for you to get credit for the users you have brought to the deal. See under\nStage 8\nin the Sales Go To Market Handbook.\nOpportunity Creation Workflow\nScheduling IQMs\nCreating Opportunities:\nIdentify and Relate Communications\n: Identify relevant two-way communications with the prospect, such as email exchanges, call records, or LI messages. Ensure that these are properly logged in SFDC associated with the\nperson, company, and opportunity records\nas needed. To do this:\nSelect the specific activity records highlighting your involvement and press\nrelated to\n.\nSelect the corresponding Opportunity and press Save.\nSelect specific activity records highlighting your involvement and press\nrelated to\nSelect the corresponding Opportunity and press\nSelect specific activity records highlighting your involvement\nand press\nrelated to\nSelect the corresponding Opportunity and press save.\nVerify Sales Organization RoE\n: On ZoomInfo, or other established sources if needed, verify the parent/child segmentation and the HQ of the company or ultimate user.\nIf discrepancies exist, communicate with the appropriate personnel for resolution.\nOverriding Incorrect Account Assignments**\nNavigate to the\nLead/Contact Review Admin\nsection in Salesforce to input correct information.\nAfter making sure that the information is properly reflected on the\nCompany Address\nfields (ie:\nCompany Address: Street\n), please tick the\nCompany Address Checked\ncheckbox on the lead level. If this step is not completed, then you will receive a message to remind you on Salesforce when you try to convert the lead.\nIf unsuccessful, communicate with the Sales Dev Director for assistance in updating account records.\nSchedule IQM\n: For booking meetings, use\nGroove Meetings\nto expedite the experience for prospects.\nMake sure to give a 24 hour notice to the AEs.\nHaving sent a meeting invitation, ask the prospect to accept while on the phone/meeting with them.\nAE Review\n: Expect AEs to verify that they reviewed the opportunity beforehand.\nIf needed, review the specifics of the call, responsibilities, and send meeting reminders.\nAttending the IQM\n: Please make sure that both AE and SDR show up on time or up to 5 minutes beforehand with Cameras on.\nPlease ensure that the location is quiet and indoors for AE and SDR.\nDebrief\n: Have a goal for the AE and SDR to debrief within 24 hours regarding the opportunity being flipped or being disqualified.\nEnsure that feedback is shared in writing via Slack/email and added to Salesforce by the AE.\nIQM Notes\n: SDR adds IQM notes to the Initiative section in the opportunity Title.\nInclude Attendees, Raw Notes, Questions, Summary, and Next Steps.\nRebooking no-shows\n: The SDR’s responsibility lies only in rebooking no-shows using a structured Groove Flow.\nConduct outreach for 2 weeks. If IQM cannot be rescheduled, AE will unqualify the opportunity.\nTrial Extensions and Ultimate to Premium Downgrades\nTo submit a trial extension ticket for a prospect you will navigate\nto this internal request form\nand fill it out the form using the\n“GitLab L&R internal request for global customers”\noption and then select extend a gitlab.com trial. Keep in mind it only works for SaaS and not self-managed.\nYou are also able to downgrade a Trial from Ultimate to Premium through the internal request form. You just have to choose “Change existing GitLab.com Trial plan”\nOpportunity Naming Convention\nNew Business: [Quantity]\n[Name of Company]- [Quantity] [Edition]\nExample: Acme, Inc- 50 Premium\nAdd-On Business (seats only):\n[Name of Company]- Add [Quantity] [Product]\nExample: Acme, Inc- Add 25 Duo\nAdd-On Business (Upgrade from Premium to Ultimate):\n[Name of Company]- Upgrade to Ultimate\nExample: Acme, Inc- Upgrade to Ultimate\nMonthly Audit Process\nIn an effort to increase transparency as well as consistency in terms of credit attribution for opportunities sourced by the Sales Development organization, we will conduct on a monthly basis a full audit of all opportunities giving credit to either a Sales Development or a Business Development Representative. Please do note that SDRs/BDRs that are on their ramping quarter are exempt from being auditors.\nParticipating and completing the audit on time is mandatory.\nGuiding principles:\nAll activities must be logged and documented in Salesforce.\nTimestamps for such activities will be audited and cannot be modified after the fact\nSourcing cases must be clearly documented.\nAll opportunities associated with a Sales Development team member must have meaningful engagement for Web Directs and full qualifications criteria for Direct Deals.\nMandatory SLA:\nAudit and XDR response must be completed by the first day of the following month. Rulings will be completed by the management team by the end of the second day.  Invitations and pairing will be sent to the entire Sales Dev team the first week of the month. It is the responsibility of the team member to find a backfill to do their audit if they are unable to complete the audit within set timelines.\nXDR’S RESPONSIBILITY\nAll activities must be logged in Salesforce.\nPro-actively flag opportunities with questions or created outside the standard process in the monthly\nAudit Doc.\n. Please note that there’s a separate audit worksheet specific to the PubSec team that is shared separately for compliance reasons.\nExamples: web directs. AE-created. Partner generated (for now), Opp w/no value, duplicate opp\nAUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY\nAuditor needs to review all notes and time stamps related to the opportunity\nAuditor needs to log an activity #Audited on the activity record of the opportunity as mentioned below, this way we can track completion of monthly audit.\nEnsure that relevant activity & products are attached.\nEnsure that Products match up to Qualification info in Call Connect and/or Meeting\nFor BDRs, ensure account was in AWA status\nensuring that the\nRoE\nwas followed\nFlag in the monthly\nAudit Doc\n, any questions related to the audited opportunities.\nAUDIT PROCESS\nEach month you will be assigned one of your peers to Audit. We will share a report with all the S1 opportunities created that month. SDRs will audit SDRs and BDRs will audit BDRs. We will do our best to pair people from the same segment however it is possible that you end up auditing someone from another segment.\nOnce you’ve audited an opp, you will create a task by logging a call, choose “other” as type, and write “#Audited” in the subject line. If an opp needs more research, write “#Audited - Pending Review” and add this opp into the Audit Review spreadsheet.\nAudit Process Video Walkthrough\nAUDIT REVIEW (what to look for)\nAction\nRationale\nCoaching Opportunity\nOpp creator\nOur standard is to get to credited for creating opportunities that meet the qualification criteria.\nWhen you set up a conversation with an AE, you should create the opportunity. If we see that an opp was created by an AE but has the SQS = Sales Dev Generated, there will need to be evidence of meaningful engagement by the Sales Dev rep prior to the opp being created.\nFor Web Direct opportunities, check timestamp and for two way meaningful engagement prior to the purchase\nWeb Direct opportunities are people that bought directly from the store themselves without necessarily having being influenced by us.\nExplain that our role in this company is to directly influence purchasing decisions through positive and purposeful interactions with prospects. Requesting credit when we have not added specific value to a prospect’s journey diminishes the credibility of our team.\nCheck to see whether opportunity qualification fields are populated.\nMarketing and Sales are expected to collaborate to move prospects down the funnel based on specific qualifiers. When it comes to Stage-0 opportunities these are the opportunity qualification fields.\nIt’s common that individuals do not fill these fields in the name of agility. This however does not create accountability in progressing these prospects down the funnel in a predictable manner.\nCheck the date of opportunity creation.\nCreation of the opportunity should occur when you’re engaged with the prospect and have begun the qualification process. There will sometimes be a child or related opp that needs to  be created based on needs discovered during the IQM with AE. Should that be the case, the created child/related opp should have the IQM activity as a related task on it.\nExplain that creating opps as soon as engagement occurs will lead to better management of a BDRs/SDRs pipeline.\nCheck to see if there is a contact associated to the opp and that there’s meaningful engagement prior to the opp being created.\nOur standard process requires that we work specific leads and that we convert the main contact person to a contact/opportunity upon qualification.\nExplain that this best practice will help with measuring and moving an opportunity further down the pipeline because of accurately being able to communicate the decision-making team from the prospect’s side.\nIf activity shows up on the record, and the activity is a connected call with notes, verify that the activity matches in Groove.\nActivities on SFDC can be edited freely and therefore questioned by our audit team.\nExplain that Groove is a SSoT that can be used as irrefutable proof of outreach. Even if other systems fail, Groove is always used as the last back-up.\nIf activity matches, check that activity happened in accordance with our Actively Working Rules Of Engagement (RoE).\nTeam members from both Sales and Marketing are expected to contribute pipeline only within their assigned territory.\nExplain that making sure that being aligned to the RoE will not create any contigencies when measuring pipeline.\nTypical Red Flags\nOpportunity Source: Sales Qualified Source should be SDR generated if not validate that there is a sourcing case documented.\nCreated by: The XDR should create the opportunity, if not, there should be a written explanation\nDid the XDR set and complete a meeting on the same day without previous activity?\nAre there duplicate opportunities?\nIs NetARR missing?\nDirectors, Ops and JB will select random opps each month to audit and ensure audit process is being followed\nBest practices to ensure credit for SAO\nAdd all leads to Flows, if you’re reaching out to them.\nMake sure your activity is logged that shows how you drove the meaningful engagement that led to the opportunity.\nPopulate all qualification fields\nIf activity was a phone call or a zoom call, log notes at the time of call\nIf a meeting was set, make sure you create a stage 0 opportunity prior to the meeting, populate fields during/afterwards. If person will likely web direct, keep opp in your name and update next steps, ensure that prospect is guided to web-direct using the Flow\nhere\n, as per the conversation\nhere\n.\nIf engagement is in LinkedIn or Whatsapp, take a picture and attach to chatter/opp\nIf activity happened at an event, make sure that immediately following the event, you create a stage 0 opportunity and  send follow up email that recaps the conversation that took place\nReports\nSAO Report for SDRs\nSAO Report BDRs\nOur Complementary Resources\nBest Practices for Outbound BDRs\nCold-Calling and Email Checklist\nOur cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.\nTo be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:\nDifferent Geographical Business Cultures\nPersonality Type as per the DISC model\nIndividual’s Role and Responsibilities\nBusiness’ Needs and Objectives\nCall Scripts\nYou can find three examples of our cold call scripts in the description of the\nBDR 101 Level Up Course\nThe main documentation may be\nfound here\nand the library of resources\nhere\n.\nUp-Front Contract\nTypically used for scheduled calls and Up-Front Contracts. UFCs can also be used as a defense mechanism when cold calling does not go as planned. For cold-calling, UFCs are used when the prospect can commit to 15’ at the time of the call. If they commit to a 15’ for a later time, UFCs are used to open the call and set the agenda then.\nExplore the main documentation\nhere\n.\nDecision Maker Discovery\nThe questions below are suggestions to be used while doing a discovery call, in order to identify the decision making process, and to meet the outbound accepted SAO as per the guidelines\nhere.\nWho gets involved while evaluating a tool at {{company}}?\nWould you expect anyone to challenge your initiative, and if so can I help by connecting with anyone else on your end?\nIf you as a {{title}} wanted to purchase GitLab, what process internally would you have to follow, and how can we help you navigate it?\nWhat challenges do you expect to face when trying to pitch this change internally? Who has a say in this and what do they care about the most?\nEmail Writing Cheat Sheet\nThe table below shows the Command of the Message Email Writing Checklist.\nIt aims to outline the structure of the emails we write to prospects. Emails should be written in each person’s language and tone and make sure to include the CoM frameworks as per the outline below. You can find additional resources\nhere.\nSubject Line\nPersonalized\n- Use Prospect’s name, Company name, or colleague’s name. - Relate to their situation: Use recent company initiatives, technologies they use, Projects they have planned etc.\nCuriosity and Urgency\n- Provide an image of their future situation: Guide the reader to imagine how their situation could change. - Use compelling events to give a clear image of where they are currently.\nCoM\n- Proof Points: Quote Case Studies or other customers. - How We Do it Better: Make use of our defensible differentiators.\nOpening Line\nAvoid cliches\n- Stand out: Avoid losing email real-estate with cliche phrases like “just following up” or “hope all is well”. - Brand yourself: Demonstrate that you have an understanding of the reader’s current situation and a clear idea of his required solutions.\nCoM\n- Before Scenarios: Paint a clear image of their current situation and how that is causing them professional or personal pain. - After Scenarios/PBOs: Tie the current situation with a clear image of a future situation that’s beneficial for the business and the individual.\nMain Body\nAddressing Questions and Information provided\n- No Free Consulting: Answer questions just enough to give a narrative to your email and tie into the CTA. - No Transactional Answers: Don’t make the reader feel like he’s interacting with an online form, a robot, or a sleazy salesman that doesn’t care.\nCoM\n- Discovery Questions: determine which discovery questions tie into their current situation, questions asked or information provided. - Trap-Setting Questions: if competitor technology or objections come up, use trap-setting questions to guide the reader into understanding our differentiators.\nCTA\nClear Next Step, Agenda and benefit\n- Valuable: phrase your CTA in a way that’s clearly valuable to the reader and his specific situation. - Defined: outline what will happen in the next step and how long will it take\nCoM\n- Measurable: present metrics or PBOs that will be covered in the next step\nAdditionally, you can use the matrix below as a quick-cheet to determine what datapoints can be used for personalization.\nLocation\nInformation\nLinkedIn\n- Have they recently been promoted? - What are the specific responsibilities stated on their page you are trying to help them with?\nCompany strategy from website\n- What are the company’s strategic initiatives? (become more agile?, improve internal business systems?, focus on speed to market on delivery? Streamlining expenditure?)\nGoogle search name of contact\n- Do they have any blogs? - Have they featured in any articles? - Have they any personal achievements celebrated? - Do they have any side projects?\nKeyword search company\n- “COMPANY” AND (“Agile” OR “digital transformation” OR “DevOps” OR “business process improvement” OR “Cloud” OR “digital strategy”)\nLeadership Focus\n- Find articles of leadership through boolean searches and ask propose how we can help them achieve these goals\nCompany News\n- Celebrate company achievements\nCheck support tickets\n- Are they experiencing issues that upgrading deployment options could help resolve?\nMutual Contacts\n- Do you have mutual contacts on LinkedIn you can talk about?\nUse cases on website\n- Do they have the same customers as us? How do they help them?\nSpeak to a user of the tool to create personalized message to decision maker\n- Speak to someone who uses out tools every day to uncover pain-points (performance degradation at peak times) and take that information to a decision maker\nBDR Territory Movement Rules of Engagement\nWhen a territory moves from one BDR to another but the previous BDR remains with the same team (ex: moves from one MM territory to another) the BDR vacating the territory will have the chance to temporarily retain ownership of accounts with which they have generated ongoing engagement (subject to manager approval). At the time of the holdover, an issue will be created that will be reviewed in 30 days to verify account ownership. This includes:\nThe outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which they can demonstrate two-way engagement that could potentially lead to an IQM and new opportunity. If, after 30 days, no IQM has been set and no stage 0 opportunity exists, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory. If the outgoing BDR is successful in generating a new opportunity, the account will remain with them until the opportunity is either qualified or unqualified.\nThe outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which there is an existing stage 0 opportunity where they are listed as the BDR. After 30 days if the opportunity is not qualified, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory.\nIn instances where an account has been reassigned to the new BDR and the outgoing BDR had two-way engagement more than 30 days ago with the account but was unable to convert them to an SAO, and the account later returns unprompted and with no prior activity from the new BDR assigned to the territory and wants to pursue a conversation with sales, the team (manager) will receive SAO credit from any resulting opportunity.\nAny other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the BDRs’ leader and senior leader.\nAssigning SAO Credit when a Territory Change is Uncovered during Discovery\nThere will be times when an SDR or BDR is working a prospect and, after connecting with the prospect, discovers that the corresponding account actually belongs to a different segment than originally thought. This could be due to newly uncovered information regarding employee count, HQ location, or parent account relationship. SAO credit in these situations will vary based on the circumstances and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Specifically:\nIf the SDR or BDR has done their due diligence to verify account information and still ends up finding an opportunity outside of their territory: as long as the related account isn’t an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, and the SDR or BDR’s manager has verified that the accurate information could not have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, then that SDR or BDR and their team will get SAO credit.\nIf the related account is an AWA or there is related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, SAO credit will belong to the BDR assigned to the AWA or the SDR working the lead related to the account.\nIf the related account isn’t an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, but the SDR or BDR’s manager determines that the accurate information should have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, SAO credit will be assigned to the team manager assigned to the correct territory.\nAny other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the SDR or BDR’s leader and senior leader.\nIn situations where an SDR or BDR has received conflicting information and it is unclear what the correct territory is for an account, they should Chatter the AEs assigned to the potential territories and have them figure out who owns it.\nWorking with Resellers\nThe end-user account determines the BDR/SDR alignment: If you are the SDR assigned to the 3rd party lead, please gather the information in point 1 and pass the lead to the correctly assigned BDR (the BDR assigned to the end-user account) who will complete points 2-6\nStep\nDescription\nGather billing and end-user details from the reseller\n- Billing company name/address:\n- Billing company contact/email address:\n- End-user company name/address:\n- End-user contact/email address:\nCreate a new lead record with end-user details\n- Ensure that all notes are copied over to the new LEAD as this is the LEAD that will be converted.\nConverting the new lead\n- Name opp to reflect reseller involvement as shown here: “End-user account name via reseller account name”\n- Convert original reseller lead to a contact associated with the reseller account\n- If an account does not already exist for the reseller, create one when converting the lead to a contact\n- Assign the record to the same account owner\n- Do NOT create a new opportunity with this lead.\nAttach activity to the opportunity\n- On the reseller contact, go to the activity and link each activity related to your opportunity to the opp.\n- Activity History > click edit to the left of the activity > choose ‘opportunity’ from the ‘related to’ dropdown > find the new opportunity > save\nUpdate the opportunity\n- Change the business type to new business and stage to pending acceptance.\n- Under contacts, add the reseller contact, role as reseller, and primary contact.\n- Under partners, add the reseller account as VAR/Reseller\nSDR/BDR to AE SAO Handoff Process\nThe purpose of the BDR-AE outbound handoff process is three fold.\nEnsure Outbound prospects get the best experience possible.\nEnsure the BDR team enjoys operational efficiencies and have clearly structured ways to collaborate with the AE team on outbound accounts.\nEnsure the AE team is set up for success is receiving outbound leads in a structured manner and have the appropriate information to utilize in converting them.\nTo make sure that the hand-offs maximize internal efficiencies, it is required that:\nThe BDR team makes sure to book calls, with a minimum notice time of 48 business hours.\nThe BDR team makes sure to properly fulfil Outbound SAO criteria, or work with AE to create a mutual command plan.\nThe AE team makes sure to:\nAccept SAOs within 8 working hours after an IQM call.\nTo leave a chatter note on the opportunity record, tagging BDR and AE manager with feedback on the level of qualification and handoff in case of discrepancies.\nTo be responsible for managing the prospect relationship after all handoff types have taken place. This includes re-scheduling conflicts.\n1. BDR Qualified Meeting\nAre leads that have been qualified by the BDR over a Discovery call.\nCoM principles\nhave been applied to the call and some of the Before/After Scenarios, Positive Business Outcomes, Requirements and Metrics have been identified and agreed upon between the prospect and the BDR.\nThere is a clear need or intent identified from the side of the company, and the prospect has clearly articulated a path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.\nBDR steps after discovery call\nSummarize CoM principles uncovered during the call\nSchedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect\nMeeting Type should be a 45’ Call and the body of invitation should be adjusted to meet the prospect’s needs.\nSend AE Intro Email\nFor demanding hand-offs, customer-facing agenda may also be copied and attached to intro email.\nLog Required SFDC fields and populate Notes field.\nUnless there’s a scheduling conflict for the BDR, attend Evaluation Orchestration Call and kick-off the call:\nSummarize the BDR qualifying conversation by mentioning and verifying the before and after scenario of the prospect, as transcribed on the SAO notes.\nAfter prospect acknowledges that their internal situation have not changes in between BDR and AE call, recap the expectations and metrics as transcribed on the SAO notes and handoff to AE to move forward.\n2. Joint IQM\nAre meetings booked with leads that are from pre-agreed upon Actively Working Acounts.\nCalls scheduled for these prospects will be taken as a joint IQM with both BDR and AE attending, and leading the qualification.\nCoM principles will be applied during the call, with the goal of uncovering a clear need and path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.\nBDR steps before discovery call\nSchedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect, and schedule straight to the AEs calendar.\nMeeting Type should be a 15’ Discovery Call.\nCreate SFDC opportunity, and log any pre-determined or relevant information from your past reseearch.\nCommunicate with AE, and create a mutual command plan for the call.\nWhen kicking off the call, summarize the BDR research and reason for reaching out, such compelling events, Persons with LIM, etc\nAfter prospect acknowledges their compelling event and internal situation, discovery call continues with pre agreed upon structure with AE.\nOrganizing a Group Demo\nOrganizing a shared demo makes it more simple for us to offer spontaneously a demonstration of GitLab, which should result in a easier handover of opps, and ease to create opps. As BDRs, we arranged the execution of this demo by creating a zoom webinar, and configuring the whole event so that the administrative side is automated.\nDefine the criteria that qualifies an opportunity as eligible to go to a shared demo.\nSAL/AE is involved only\nThe SAL can invite his/her/their customers or contacts in order to add value to their ongoing discussion, if the AE/SAL finds it relevant. This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer.\nSAL/AE and BDR are involved\nThe BDR schedules a discovery meeting with the SAL (whether it is a prospect or customer) that generates a qualified opportunity. Once the opportunity is created, the SAL/BDR suggests the shared demo instead of the individual demo based on the priority of the opportunity (importance of the account, number of licenses, amount of the opportunity, persona). This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer. There needs to be an opportunity in this case to suggest the demo, for the sake of collaboration between the SAL and the BDR.\nBDR is involved only\nWhen a lead with decision power or significant influence in the org (no individual contributor) expresses a high interest for GitLab (aka: high read/open rates on an email, response received by phone with interest confirmed) AND when the BDR has a tangible reason to think that there is a need in the division/team/company (research, information obtained through other leads in the same org), the BDR can leverage the shared demo for HOT leads to create interest or a sense of urgency, the goal being to have the lead jump on an introductory meeting after the shared demo.\nDefine the criteria for different groups of attendees who can join this demo\nAttendees coming from a BDR conversation\nIn order to attend a demo, this attendee needs to be part of an opportunity in at least stage 1- Discovery.\nAttendees coming from the AE’s conversations\nThe AE can leverage this shared demo to invite his own contacts.\nStep-by-step guide to plan a demo\n1. Get a Zoom Webinars license\nYou don’t have a Webinar licence by default, so you need to open an access request issue on GitLab to ask for one.\n2. Go on Zoom SSO > Webinars (on the left under Meetings) > Schedule a webinar\nYou will be able to save the entire configuration of the webinar as a template, in order not to set it up again.\n3. Change the topic, description, date/time, and duration\nChange the topic (this will be the title of your demo, and the name of the event on Google Calendar), the description (describes the content of the demo, the idea is to adapt the focus of the demo depending on your attendees), set the date/time of the demo, and the duration (note that setting a certain duration will not stop the zoom webinar once the time has gone).\n4. Tick the box ‘Required’ next to registration\n5. Change the Dial country to match attendees’ language\n6. Configure additional settings such as Q&A, recording, and email settings\n7. Save the configuration as a template for future use\nOutbound Account Ranking Matrix\nThis complementary table can help structure your thinking around what outbound accounts to choose.\nAccount Scoring & Prioritization\nPriority 1 Actively Working Accounts (15%)\n- Strong ICP Qualities\n- Compelling Triggers\n- Strategy is Tailored and Targeted\n- Future based next step dates\n- Specific next step notes\nPriority 2 Actively Working Accounts (35%)\n- ICP qualities\n- No Triggers\n- Strategy is Targeted (persona/industry based)\n- Future based next step dates updated weekly/bi-weekly\n- Next step notes should just include week #\nPriority 3 Actively Working Accounts (50%)\n- ICP qualities\n- No Recent Triggers\n- Strategy is nurture based\n- Future based next step dates updated monthly\n- Next step notes should just include recent release # or event invite\nOther Good Account Scoring Qualifiers:\n- Current CE Usage\n- 250+ employees in IT/TEDD positions\n- Good Fit Industry / Vertical (High Growth, Technology, Financial, Healthcare, Regulated Business)\n- Early Adopters / Innovative IT Shops (Identifiers & Keywords): Kubernetes / Containers, Microservices, Multi-cloud, DevOps, DevSecOps, CICD (and open-source + proprietary tools), SAST / DAST, Digital Transformation\n- Current DevOps Adoption (multiple DevOps roles on staff or hiring for multiple DevOps positions)\nOutbound Prospecting Framework\n|\nPriority Level\n|\nAccount Strategy Includes\n|\nNext Step Date\n|\nNext Step Notes\n|\n| Priority 1 | Priority #, Any Details | Future based next steps | Hyper-personalized, simultaneous outreach, creative, direct mail, ads, groundswell, events |\n| Priority 2 | Priority #, Weekly Plan or Length of Groove Flow | Future based next steps depending on account strategy | Include the weeks outreach and overall strategy |\n| Priority 3 | Priority # | Update Next Step Date to next months outreach | BDR Next Step, What kind of nurture (Product Updates, Events, Ect) |\nGrowth Strategies, Ranking and RoE\nStrategies:\nGrowth within an existing customer account: BDR should strategically partner with SAE/ISR to identify additional business units to bring into the conversation as growth opportunities. Renewal dates should be exploited.\nExpansion into parent/children/subsidiaries of existing customer accounts: These are accounts that fall within the corporate hierarchy within Salesforce. If a child/subsidiary account is identified via ZoomInfo but not in our system, then BDR should follow the following process: Create a LEAD for that account and then convert to CONTACT to create the ACCOUNT when you qualify your first lead.\nFree to paid upgrades: Existing Core/CE users can be targeted to upgrade to a paid version of GitLab\nRanking and prioritization of accounts:\nRank 1: Expand with Purpose (EwP) accounts should be closely/strategically worked with SAEs.

Pre-made prompts are also saved and shared on the same project in the Activity tab of this Project. Please feel free to use and/or duplicate this Project and the Saved Prompts for your purposes. We have the #sales_dev_claude_insights Slack channel or the\nPrompt Library Issue\nthat you can use to report your wins to the team.\nLimitations\nClaude can’t access GitLab systems, databases, or customer information directly. While Claude can analyze data you share, it can’t pull anything from GitLab’s internal tools or CRM.\nAdding up to Orange Data has been approved.\nClaude can’t maintain context between conversations - each chat starts fresh, so previous discussions about prospects or strategies won’t be remembered.\nUnderstand that\nClaude is not always right and will sound very confident even when it is wrong\nGeneral Tips\nTreat it like you are having a conversation with a highly intelligent robot (ex. C3P0)\nAlways try to ask follow up questions to get better answers\nYou can always have Claude write ideal prompts for you!\nBecause Claude’s data cut off is from April you can upload up to date target account’s 10Ks, annual reports, and investor letters for up to date research\nYou can use Claude to help you reformat your spreadsheets! It is recommended to upload your data in CSV format.\nExamples of Questions to Ask\n“Can you see if this companies’ annual report mentions DevOps, Software, Cyber Security, Git?\n“Can you make this email reply more concise?”\n“Let’s say I was a sales rep from GitLab. How should I approach this company/title?” (Can use Panos’s prompt in the prompt library as well )\n“Can you explain why you gave x answer?”\n“Can you rewrite that in a more casual tone?”\n“I do not like that message you generated.Can you give me 3more options and explain the pros and cons of each?”\nZoomInfo\nZoominfo\nprovides our Sales Development Representatives and Account Executives with access to hundreds of thousands of prospects and their contact information, company information, tech stack, revenue, and other relevant data. Individual records or bulk exports can be imported into Salesforce using extensive search criteria such as job function, title, industry, location, tech stack, employee count, and company revenue.

While the content beblow is more specific to our Sales Development team, please visit the\nMarketing Operation’s handbook page here\nfor a full breakdown of 6Sense’s functionality.\n6Sense Training Resources\nGeneral 6Sense Resources\n6Sense for BDRs Video\n6Sense Account Identification Guide\n6Sense Persona Identification Guide\n6Sense 6QA Automations\nWe currently have in place an automation that will automatically move accounts that reach 6QA status from 6Sense to SFDC. A detailed breakdown of\nthese workflows is described here\n.\nSpecifically:\nAccounts flagged as 6QA from 6Sense, whether they already exist on our system or not, will automatically be marked with the fields:\nBDR Prospecting Status: Actively Working\nBDR Account Strategy: Showing Intent\nThese Accounts will be flagged on 1:1 dashboards for team members to review with an expected SLA of\n48 hours\nWhile these accounts are automatically switched to Actively Working to indicate the high propensity to buy, team members need to still review and accept or dispute a 6QA account.\nFor FY26Q1 we are adding a\nDispute Reason for Low LAM Dev Count\nwhich team members can use when they opt to not pursue a 6QA account because of a small account value potential.\nAny accounts that team members choose to dispute using the instructions below will be flagged to the Action Needed dashboards for Managers to keep track of.\nAccepting or Disputing accounts can be done through a secondary field titled\n6QA Acceptance Status\nwhere the options\nDisputed\n(would need to provide reasoning) or\nAccepted\ncan be found.\nAny accounts that marked as\nAccepted\nby the BDR team will trigger the\nZoomInfo workflow here\nto automatically bring relevant decision-makers for these accounts to the\nB6 view on SFDC\n.\nThis is a complementary automation for the outbound team to automatically source some prospects for you. you are still expected to properly add the account to your pipeline following the steps outlined above.\nImportant Note:\nWhen 6QA accounts are non-FO available and non-Compensation Target Account (non-Pursuit Account), BDR Prospecting Status will update to SDR Hold for 14 days. If an open opportunity is not created within the 14 days, the account will be updated to Actively Working and Showing Intent and the ownership will be updated to BDR.\nQualified\nQualified\nis the Sales Dev Org’s tool we use to chat with visitors on the GitLab website. Currently the SDR teams primarily respond to inbound chats and visitors using Qualified. The BDRs also have the ability to initiate chats with known leads from their actively working accounts.\nGong\nRefer to the\nGong\nhandbook page for full details on how Gong is leveraged at GitLab.\nSales Development Org team members are provided with Gong collaborator licenses for visibility to recorded sales conversations.\nSDR and BDR team members are able to leverage the\nGong Meeting\noption when creating meeting invites for prospects and customers. By using this option and adding an Account Executive with Gong recorder access to the meeting invite, Gong will leverage the AE’s recorder access to record the meeting, assuming all meeting participants consent to record. More details about the Gong consent page can be found in the\nGong internal handbook page\n. Once the recording is processed, the Account Executive that was added to the invite will be listed in Gong as the host and owner of the call with the SDR or BDR as an attendee.\nCrayon Competitive Messaging Resources\nCrayon\nhosts competitive messaging resources that are maintained by GitLab’s product marketing team.\nThis is where you can find messaging related to GitLab vs some of our competiors such as GitHub, Atlassian, and Azure DevOps\nUserGems\nUserGems\nis a tool that tracks specific cohorts of people that we provide in terms of them changing jobs. This automated tracking provides valuable insights, surfacing warm leads that can drive faster, larger wins. This tool helps mitigate deal risks when key individuals leave accounts, and accelerates deal progress when influential contacts join new organizations.\n1. When a person that we are tracking leaves their current place of employment\nThese people are identified by the lead initial source being\nUserGems Contact Tracking\nUserGems will track that person to their new role and will automatically create a lead with their new details in our system.\nThese leads will be flagged on the\nAction Needed BDR dashboards\nfor you and your manager’s review, as well as on the\nB2 views\nWe expect that our\nstandard RoE\nwill be followed normally in actioning these leads, similar to MQLs.\nThese leads will be routed to the BDR team if:\nThey are associated to an Actively Worked Account\nAre connected to a Pursuit Account, or an account that has been marked as\n6QA by 6Sense\nThe rest of the leads that do not fit these parameters will be routed round-robin to the SDR team.\nThese leads should also be considered as intent data for prospecting an outbound account.\nTake the time to research accounts for the propensity to purchase and intent signals. Could the tracked contact’s hire into that account be a compelling event for you to use?\nThis data can be found either on our 1:1 Dashboards on report 6 that’s dedicated to UserGems, or through this\nlead-level SFDC template that you can clone and use.\nAnalyze the hiring and promotion patterns as business signals.\nA surge in technical hires (e.g., developers, engineers) may indicate growth initiatives, product development, or a focus on scaling infrastructure.\nSales or customer success hires could suggest plans to expand revenue through growth or enhance customer retention strategies.\nSenior Leadership hires may indicate an internal restructuring of a department or a new business initiative.\nUse these hiring signals to identify potential challenges or priorities, such as team collaboration, scaling efficiently, or driving revenue growth. Based on these, target decision-makers who are likely overseeing these initiatives, like directors or VPs.\nWe’ll also notify you via Slack and email about these Job Changes.\n2. When a company that we are tracking gets a new hire or promotion\nThese people are identified by the lead initial source being\nUserGems - New Hires and Promotions\nThese people will be automatically be enrolled to a fully automated AI-driven sequence as per the guidelines below.\nSimilar to above, the same people will be flagged on dashboards and reporting for you to consider as intent signals to add their respective accounts to your pipeline.\nWe expect that our\nstandard RoE\nwill be followed normally.`\nWe are actively working to remove irrelevant prospect titles from being created as part of the\nUserGems - New Hires and Promotions\nlead sources. If you notice any titles that you feel should not have been created because they’re irrelevant to DevOps decision-making in that company, please feel free to use the #usergems-feedback Slack channel to let us know, and we’ll work with our CSM to review them.\nIn the meantime, you can also mark these leads as Status\nDisqualified\nand Disqualified reason\nNo Authority\n3. When people leave or join accounts where we have open opportunities\nWhile we are actively working to improve our back-end so that this cohort can be visible on our dashboards, like the use-cases above, we are relying on sending notifications only for these people. In the meantime, you can use the report here to gauge what prospects we have on\nthis list\n. We are currently notifying:\nThe Sales team for people that joined or left a stage 3 or beyond opportunity.\nThe Sales and Sales Development teams for people that joined or left a stage 0, 1 or 2 opportunity.\nThese people are not enrolled to a specific flow, since there multiple scenarios on how to best address them, please search Groove for templated messages\nlike this one\nthat you can use.\nGem-E FY26 Auto Enrollment\nFor FY26Q1 we will pilot auto-enrolling UG leads to a dedicated Groove Flow which will make sure of UserGem’s AI functionalities.\nLeads that have no activity, and match the filters on the\nSMB report here\nor\nMM/ENTG report here\nwill be automatically added to either an\nSMB\nor\nMM/ENTG\nflow.\nThese flows will automatically include AI generated customisation. Please review the\nslides\nor the\nvideo presentation here\nfor a full walkthrough.\nThese leads will be flagged on the dashboards similar to the explanation above and progress can be tracked from there.\nGem-E Meeting Assistant\nAs part of our Gem-E pilot, we are also trialling UserGems Meeting Assistant. The Assistant integrates with your calendar invitations and automatically pulls the contact information of people that are attending your call, but are not in our database yet.\nThese people will be created as net new contacts and leads in SFDC, using the initial source\nUserGems - Meeting Assistant\n. They can be assigned to the existing account or opportunity that you are working on, so you can continue multi-threading the account that you are working on.\nSales Dev Manager Resources\nSales Dev Operations Team Regional Availability\nThe Global Sales Dev Operations team has the office hours below, so that regional team members can know how to address internally.

Please find a\nlink to an issue that we use for planning and feedback here.\nSales Dev Operations Working Sessions\nThe Sales Dev Ops team also holds recurring weekly working sessions, with up to four participants per session. These sessions are aligned to the month’s theme outlined above, and are designed to collaborate on key operational topics and initiatives.\nSales Dev Research Desk\nOur Sales Dev Ops team can help you with researching our suite of databases (Sales Nav, ZoomInfo, Cognism, 6Sense) to help you manage your actively worked account list. We typically focus on accounts that are not currently available to our database, but can help with other ideas that you may have. Please log an issue to our board\nhere\nusing the template\nBDR_Research_Request\nSales Dev Housekeeping Issue\nThe team has an issue where we consolidate our monthly to-dos (titled\nMonthly Housekeeping\n).

The full video playlist of this training is\non our Unfiltered playlist here\n. Moreover, abbreviated notes of the training can be\nfound here\nand a list of questions that we expect our Managers to be able to answer\nhere\n, along with passing criteria and some more video guides.\nGeneral leadership principles\nThis page will serve as a training resource and operational guide for current and future managers. All Sales Development Managers should follow the\ngeneral leadership principles\nset out in the handbook.\n1-1s\nProviding regular feedback\nDealing with underperformance\nManager Onboarding\nOnboarding is essential for all Sales Development Managers at GitLab. As part of onboarding, a\nBecoming a GitLab Manager\nissue will be created for each manager when they join, or are promoted. This issue is intended to connect new managers with the crucial information they need, and ensure they have access to all the resources and training available.\nOutbound BDR Process Manager Onboarding\nThe BDR process that we have defined here in GitLab is meant to provide a repeatable set of steps that an outbound BDR can follow to achieve results. It is very important for an onboarding manager to align themselves as quickly as possible to this process as it is a proven method that will help them manage their team in a efficient and data-driven way.\nThe BDR Process is explained step-by-step in the\nsection here\nFor a newcoming manager, we provide the Manager attention needed boards that will be your main tool in understanding where your team is aligned to our BDR process, and where they need assistance.\nTo help structure your usage of the above, you can follow the steps below during your first month at GitLab while\nthe document here will be your main go-to resource\nAction\nBenefit\nClone the Action Needed Dashboard and edit each report to be exclusive to your team’s names\nGives you a SSoT that you and your team can easily reference\nReview the dashboard with your team, and discuss how the data on it connect to the\nBDR KPIs\nAllows you to understand your team’s level of maturity and each team member’s current level of alignment to existing processes\nTake note of any discrepancies or points of feedback from the team, either transcribe them to 1:1s for individual conversations or to the SDR Issue board for org-wide improvements\nEnables you to filter between discrepancies that are caused because of a team member’s lack of diligence that should be improved upon by the individual OR for discrepancies that were caused by an org-wide operational shortcoming that should be improved upon on a global scale.\nSet realistic expectations with the team about adherence to org KPIs and set a review mechanism to go over them on a reccuring basis\nHelps maintain a repeatable structure of accountability for your entire team\n1:1 Account and Lead Level Dashboard Coaching guidance\nThe table below can help with structuring how you perceive and action the 1:1 Dashboards we have on SFDC and Tableau, the below connect to the\nKPI page here.\nand the videos\nhere\nand\nhere\nare two quick compelementary resources to walk you through how we use the dashboards.\nAdditionally this\n5’ video\nexplains the purpose of these dashboards, while this\n3’ video\nwalks you through a practical use case of how to use a report in these dashboards.\nDashboard\nComponent\nExpectation/Action\nCoaching Opportunity\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n0. Queued Accounts\nFor accounts in AW (Actively Working):\nThese accounts are to be cleared on a weekly basis by being moved to AWA status or by leaving a clear chatter note as feedback on why the account was not added to a prospecting pipeline. This should include datapoints from intent tools or another other SSoT as supporting evidence.\nCarefully vetting and working accounts that are queued by the Sales team will lead to better collaboration, and mutual accountability. Not only are we expected to timely review these accounts but to keep our counterparts accountable to their account ranking by providing data-driven feedback.\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n1. Review Existing Pipeline\nFor accounts in AW:\nThese accounts are currently in the team member’s name. The total volume should not be over 125 for Mid-Market BDRs and 75 for Enterprise BDRs. As a priority these should be reviewed weekly and action should be taken accordingly to remove or update these accounts.\nWhen clicking into the report the team member can screen all the datapoints that can help them gauge the status of their accounts at a glance. Activity and Research fields can be combined with intent datapoints to quickly see which accounts should be reviewed further manually.\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n2. Research Accounts to be Recycled\nFor accounts in AW:\nThese reports are nearing their automated recycle date, which by default is two months after their actively started work date. This report acts as a fallback report to the report above. A BDR should have already reviewed these accounts as part of their actively working account screen done in the previous step. This report will act as a second reminder.\nIn theory an outbound account will have received at least 30 days worth of outreach since most flows we use have at least a 30 day cadence. It’s fine to leave an account in a team member’s pipeline until it’s removed automatically in hopes of getting some inbound MQLs assigned to the BDR. Regardless, there’s a business decision to be made about whether expecting inbound MQLs is a sound strategy, based on the team members quota attainment and overall pipeline at the moment, and whether replacing the about to be expired for another account is a better route.\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n3. Re-evaluate newly added flagged accounts\nFor accounts in AW:\nThese accounts were recently added to a team member’s pipeline but at least one of our intent tools flags it as a weak account in terms of intent data.\nIn the spirit of hyper-targeted results, this account should be empty since all tools we have should agree that this account is good enough to be added to the team member’s pipeline. If there are any accounts flagged it is wise to review them and ensure that they should indeed remain with the team member’s pipeline.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n4. Check past opportunities for potential use\nFor accounts not in AW:\nThese are past opportunities that could be reviewed for re-engagement.\nClosed: Lost opportunity re-engagement is one of the best converting sources of pipeline for our team. After having reviewed the pressing reports in the first three steps above, the quickest review to make to gauge some low-hanging fruit is this report.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n5, 6 and 7. Assess high priority individuals\nFor accounts not in AW:\nThese three reports show individuals that connect to actively working accounts in the team member’s pipeline. These should be reviewed and any relevant next steps or actions should be made on the account-level bdr notes.\nThese three reports show individuals with high intent data, engagement in marketing campaigns or recent with interesting moments. While it’s not necessary that there has to be action on the specific individuals, their behavior can give significant queues into the current situation within an account.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Review High Intent Accounts.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThese reports split not-AWA accounts in a few different buckets. While there will be significant overlap, having multiple reports help prioritize how a team member can review their account list for new accounts to add to their pipeline. These reports should be reviewed weekly and the majority of AWA accounts should be sourced from one of these.\nThese reports all reference our intent based tools, existing RoE around pursuit accounts and should guide the decision-making of team members. Referencing these as a first step should create a lot of internal efficiencies in researching accounts.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n13. Consider AE-ranked accounts.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThis report visualises accounts as per the ranking that the sales team manually gave them. They should be reviewed after the team member has reviewed intent-based tools.\nThe Sales team does not have access to the same data as us so their manual research can be used a good fallback report to cross-reference against the reports in the previous steps.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n14 and 15. Review individuals from not actively worked accounts\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThese reports show individuals from non-actively worked accounts that either have been part of a marketing campaign, or show strong intent signals.\nThese individuals should be approcah as an indication that the account as a whole should be investigated for outbounding.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n16. Review individuals in flight.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThis report shows a breakdown of prospects currently on a Groove Flow. Should be reviewed for any further actions to be taken.\nConsider whether adding more individuals to a flow for a particular account might make sense, or whether the individuals from the top prospect accounts should be getting additional outreach outside of the flow steps.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n17. Consider past Actively Worked Accounts.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nAs a final check, this report should accounts that were previously outbounded for the territory, do any of them make sense in terms of re-engagement?\nOutbound efforts typically take a long time to convert an account, and reviewing new intent data is a great practice to maintaining a good re-engagememt pipeline.\nTableau Dashboard\nInbound Interest Dashboard\nThis dashboard is an intuitive way for BDRs to manually screen their database. It should be used as a complementary resource to the account-level dashboards above.\nWhile the account-level dashboards are pre-made, and there to guide the thinking of team members in terms of account research, this Tableau dashboard allows a team member more flexibility into sorting through the database. They can use the filters to replicate the permutations of the account level reports in any way that they please.\nTableau Self-Dashboard\nSelf-Managed Instances Dashboard\nThis dashboard allows BDRs to track and manage instances that are self-deployed by prospects or clients.\nIt helps BDRs understand how self-managed instances are performing and identify any potential opportunities to convert them into fully managed accounts or upsell additional services.\nTableau Self-Dashboard\nSelf-Managed Instances Dashboard\nThis dashboard allows BDRs to track and manage instances that are self-deployed by prospects or clients.\nIt helps BDRs understand how self-managed instances are performing and identify any potential opportunities to convert them into fully managed accounts or upsell additional services.\nProspect 360\nProspect 360 Dashboard\nThis dashboard\nconsolidates data from key systems like Salesforce, 6Sense, Qualified, and Marketo, providing BDRs and SDRs with a starting point for account-level prospecting. It can short-listed to identify accounts that\nBy offering a holistic view of account activities, including engagement history and lead/contact interactions, it helps teams identify and prioritize high-potential accounts for conversion.

We have created an issue template for Field Marketers to populate, which in turns gets managed from the\nKanban Board here.\nThe premise of the\nissue template\nand board is to streamline communication between our teams. The issue template very clearly articulates all next steps required of this process while it also tries to leave space for us much AdHoc collaboration as required for each specific event.\nAs a BDR Director you will be tagged first in this issue as the primary DRI, while as a BDR Manager you will be involved in this issue on a case-by-case basis by your regional Director. All next steps of this process are clearly mentioned in the template for the issue so please follow each step in turn. The Sales Dev Operations team is also tagged and will be there to monitor progress and offer help if requested.\nStatus Related 6Sense Reports\nOn folder #5 in the\n6Sense segments list\n, you’ll find the templates for the main three categories of accounts that we have. These templates are meant to be cloned and edited for your teams as per the guidelines below and will assist with coaching on 1:1s and team calls, as well as driving more predictable pipeline building.\nCurrently Actively Working Accounts Template\nThis report will cross-reference your team’s currently AWAs against 6Sense intent data, and will highlight the best ICP accounts currently on your team’s pipeline.\nCE/SFDC Accounts not in Actively Working Status\nThis report will highlight the best ICP accounts on our existing database, that are not actively being pursued by your team.\nGreenfield Accounts not in Actively Workin\nThis report will highlight the best ICP accounts that are NOt currently on our existing database. Please note that due to the complexity of our sales territories, there may be edits required on filter #8 (Address). There are multiple variants for City, Country or Region that can be used to accurately display each team’s territory. Please feel free to reach out to the Ops team to help you determine these and generate the best reports possible.\nSales Dev Territory and Role Reports\nSales Dev by Salesforce Profile and Role -\nSales Dev Ops profile is the only profile with the ability to help add a member to opps beyond stage 0 (we can’t add SDR/BDR to closed won opps however)\nCertain roles have certain permissions ie. Team Lead roles are able to transfer leads. Director level roles are able to help when account assignments are incorrect by updating account address and employee size information.\nRoles determine visibility based on the region (AMER, APAC, EMEA). Example: a BDR with EMEA in their role, will be able to see all accounts where the account territory owner has EMEA in their territory role name.\nSales Dev Territories by Team role/member associated with each territory -\nThis allows you to see what members/roles are associated with each territory. When you need a change in BDR assignment to a territory, please sharethe territory name with Sales Dev Ops, not the name of the account. Search for the account owner name and tell Sales Dev Ops which territory/territories require that BDR to be assigned.\nNew Account AE Reports\nUse\nthis report\nto figure out the territory name for the account you are working. Use command F to find the zip/state/country and figure out correct territory name.\nThen use\nthis report\nby plugging in the territory name to figure out who the correct AE is\nPlease make sure you have all the correct location information on the lead you converting to initially create this new account.\nOnboarding\nGitLab People Connect Team members will\ncreate the onboarding issue\nand start completing the onboarding tasks, no later than one week before the new team member joins. People Connect Team members require a minimum of 4 business days (with the new hire timezone as the basis) before the new hire’s start date to complete all onboarding tasks. This issue will be automatically assigned to you. As a manager, you will\nalso have tasks\nthat need to be completed prior to the new team member’s start date.\nThe general onboarding issue will also automatically add a\n‘Sales Development’ section\nunder ‘Job Specific Tasks’ based on the role of the new SDR. Both you and your new hire will have tasks to complete in this section.\nWith the creation of this issue, an\naccess request (AR) will also be automatically created\nfor a new team member on their second day at GitLab. This AR lists the role based entitlements (pre-defined groups and system-level access that are granted automatically to team members depending on their role) your new hire will need.\n*See what is being auto provisioned on this AR\nhere\n.\nNew Hire’s First Day\nOn your new hire’s first day, the assigned People Connect Team member will\nschedule a welcome email\nto arrive at 7:30am (local time of the new team member) on their start date detailing how your new hire can access GitLab and begin their onboarding process.\nManager Onboarding Checklist\nPrior to Day 1\nComplete ‘Manager’ tasks on the onboarding issue *Note: there are tasks to complete prior to your new hire starting\nSchedule a welcome call at the start of your new hire’s first day to discuss:\nMain focus should be completing as much of your onboarding as possible.\nWhen you have available time feel free to move ahead as some onboarding task lists for the day won’t take you all day.\nHow to manage meeting invites in your inbox (there are a ton!)\nYou will receive numerous emails in their first two weeks asking you to register or activate your license to a specific tool we use, please go ahead and do all of this.\nWhat you can expect in regards to\nonboarding at GitLab as an SDR\nAfter new hire has started\nComplete remaining ‘Manager’ tasks on the onboarding issue\nSet up\n1:1s\nCareer Mobility Issues\nA career mobility issue should be opened 2 weeks before the transition date by the people connect team. If the aligned manager does not see that issue created 2 days before the scheduled transition date, the manager should reach out to the People Connect Team via the\n#people-connect Slack Channel\n.\nPeople connect opens mobility issue if any of the following are true:\nIf there is a change in department.  Ex.

Due to this, your onboarding will encompass training on tools and processes related to not only your role but a blend of marketing and sales.\nThis learning experience involves virtual self-paced learning paths in the form of a general company-wide onboarding issue, a Sales Development specific issue, as well as a Google Classroom course to prep you for\nSales Quick Start (SQS)\n. SQS is a 3-day in-person immersive and hands-on workshop for all new hires in a sales development or sales role. In parallel, you will meet regularly with your manager, onboarding buddy and members of our sales development enablement team to chat through and dig a bit deeper into the topics within your onboarding.\nThe goal in all of this is to ensure that you feel confident and comfortable to hit the ground running at the start of your second month on the job when you will have a\nramped quota\n. Our hope is that along this journey you are not only gaining the tactical skills needed to complete your job, but that you form connections with colleagues, gain a strong understanding of our culture, and begin to develop industry knowledge.\nSales Development Onboarding Process\nThe People Team initiates a general GitLab onboarding issue for every new GitLab team member. On your first day, you will receive a welcome email with a link to your specific onboarding issue and steps to get started. You will also meet with your manager to discuss:\nAccess to your sales development specific issue\nPrioritizing your onboarding issues\nHow to manage calendar invites in your inbox on Day 1\nWithin 3 days of starting at GitLab, you will receive an email giving you access to\nCommand of the Message (CoM)\ne-learning materials. CoM is our value-driven conversation framework that will be covered during SQS.\nDuring your second week, the Sales Enablement Team will send you a calendar invite for the upcoming SQS as well as an email prompting you to log in to Google Classroom to begin working through the\nSales Quick Start learning path\n. Connect with your manager to arrange travel for SQS or if you are unable to attend the next session.\nWithin a week of attending SQS, you will receive access to the 13-week Command of the Message Fast Start program.\nIn your first few weeks you will receive access to your Sales Development Technical Development training.

SDRs/BDRs should not be credited on renewal opportunities as they focus on net-new business. If you believe there’s an exceptional case where SDR/BDR credit is warranted for a renewal, contact Sales Operations to discuss creating a separate opportunity or using the exceptions process.\nIs the Account in “Actively Working” Status\nNo:\nIt is worked by the SDR team\nYes:\nCheck for Activity\nDoes the account have activity placed by the BDR in the last 30 days?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the BDR Assigned.\nNo:\nCheck to see if there are leads related to the account that have activity using\nthis report\nWhen you modify this report based on company name and email domain, do you see any activity in the last 30 days?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the BDR Assigned\nNo:\nIt is worked by the SDR Team.\nNext Steps:\nSDR chatters the BDR Assigned and lets them know you didn’t find activity and will go ahead and Flow the lead. FYI’s the BDR Manager. BDR Manager will work with the BDR to put the account into the correct BDR Prospecting status. If a BDR is able to relay information that was not picked up in the SDR’s research, the SDR should end the Flow if the prospect hasn’t engaged and change lead ownership to BDR so the BDR can reach out. If the SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between SDR and BDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.\nIs the Account in “Queued” Status?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the SDR team\nIs the Account in “Worked in FY” Status?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the SDR team\nIs the Account in “Restricted” Status?\nYes:\nIt should be routed to the BDR assigned. The BDR assigned will chatter the SAE about whether they’d like them to reach out or whether they would like to own that responsibility. The AE should respond within 48 hours.\nIf they reply back that the BDR can work, the BDR will continue with the prospect as a lead record and take action.\nIf they reply back that they want to be responsible, the BDR will convert the lead so that it becomes a contact.\nAfter determining an MQL is to be worked by the SDR team:\nIs the new MQL related to an existing MQL that is part of the same account?\nNo:\nThe MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin\nYes:\nCheck the status of the existing MQL\nIs the existing MQL in Accepted or Qualifying status?\nNo:\nThe MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin\nYes:\nCheck the activity on the existing MQL\nIs there activity in the last 30 days or a follow up task scheduled for the future?\nYes:\nThe MQL should be worked by the owner of the existing MQL\nNo:\nThe MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin. If you are not sure, double-check with the related SDR.\nIs the lead automatically generated from UseGems as evident from the\nInitial Source\nfield?\nYes:\nIf it’s an SMB lead it’s worked by the inbound team, if it’s a MM/ENTG lead it’s passed to the BDR associated with the territory regardless of the rest of the RoE. BDR is expected to follow the outbound actively worked account process as per usual.\nIf the related SDR relays information that was not picked up in the new SDR’s research, the new SDR should end any active Groove Flow if the prospect hasn’t engaged and change lead ownership to the team member who has been engaged so they can reach out. If the new SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between the new SDR and the related SDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.\nRouting Workflow Chart\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nGeneral Sales Dev Trouble-shooting\nQ:\nI can’t see certain Groove collections!:\nA:\nYou potentially were added to the incorrect Sales Dev Team in Groove. Please reach out to Sales Dev Operations.\nQ:\nMy version of Salesforce seems very basic…:\nA:\nMake sure you are using the Sales version of Salesforce. To check, please go to the top right corner of your Salesforce window and click the blue button with the drop down window. From there select “Sales”.\nQ:\nI have not received access to all of my tools and it has been a week.\nA:\nNotify your manager and have them comment on your Onboarding Role Entitlements Issue.\nQ:\nI have uploaded more leads from ZoomInfo than what are showing up in my Salesforce ZoomInfo Lead View.\nA:\nThis most likely due to these leads aleady being in our Salesforce. The problem is that they are listed as a contact in Salesforce and will only appear in your ZoomInfo Contacts view rather than your Zoominfo Lead view.\nQ:\nI do not know what this person did to score as an MQL.\nA:\nFirst check the last interesting moment description on Salesforce and then check the Scoring tab of the Marketo Sales Insight widget that is also on the Salesforce lead page. If no points were allocated to behavior and only to demographic type information please Slack the Marketing Ops group so they are aware that this lead did not take any new action.\nQ:\nI received a personal data subject request by a prospect.\nA:\nOur MOPs team has set up a process to address any data subject requests for deletion or access to data. If you receive a request for deletion or access to data, please re-direct inquiries to the\nPersonal Data Subject Request\n.\nQ:\nWhy are BDRs no longer the Account Owner in SFDC?\nA:\nBDRs are no longer listed as the account Owner in SFDC to improve Sales Dev and Sales visibility across all prospects/accounts (excluding PubSec). If you want to filter to see just your accounts, please use the ‘BDR Assigned’ field.\nQ:\nA prospect said they were going to buy through our website (known as a Web Direct). How can I tell if they did?\nA:\nSDRs get credit for opportunities where the SDR had meaningful two way communication with a prospect 60 days before they bought GitLab through our website. The best way to search for a web direct opportunity is to use\nthis report\n. First, set the date range to the time you think the prospect would have bought. Next, find the opportunity that is tied to your prospect’s account. Then follow the process to request SAO credit.\nNote: Sometimes someone else from your prospect’s company actually made the GitLab purchase, leading to the opportunity being related to them instead.\nQ:\nHow do I request credit for a web direct opportunity?\nA:\nOn the opportunity record in Salesforce, compose a new Chatter message that includes the following:\nTag a member of the Operations Team (Ramona Elliott or Ed Bao) or the Director of Global Commercial Sales Development (Brian Tabbert).\nDo not tag Sales Support Yourself\nInclude a link to the record in Salesforce that shows your related two-way activity in the past 60 days. If your related activity is a phone call, you must have entered the details of the phone call into the Qualification Notes field on the lead record at the time of the call in order for it to be considered. Qualification Notes entered after the Web Direct opportunity has been created will not be considered for credit.\nExplain how you influenced their decision to purchase GitLab (helped with evaluation, uncovered a need, provided value, etc)\nThe Operations team and/or Director will review the information and decide whether SAO credit is warranted. If confirmed, they will Chatter Sales Support to add you to the opportunity. If rejected, they will communicate to you the reasoning for their decision.\nRoE Common Questions\nQ:\nShould BDRs flag duplicate accounts?\nA:\nYes. However, they do not have the ability to merge it themselves so should chatter @Sales Support to do it.\nQ:\nHow do we resolve a dispute over SAO credit?\nA:\nSDR and BDR first try to talk through a solution If no agreement: Managers will determine a solution If no agreement between the managers: Escalate to Senior Leadership Double credit nor double compensation will be given\nQ:\nWho will be handling inquiries from an SDR/BDR standpoint?\nA:\nInquiries will go to an open queue. SDR’s will not work them. We want to give marketing time to progress these to MQLs.\nA:\nBDR’s can work leads in all statuses if they are related to their “Actively working” accounts. Outreach to these leads would be part of their account strategy.\nQ:\nWhat if a prospect comes back directly to the BDR much delayed, when the account is not marked as “Actively Working” anymore, but resulting from personalized messaging?\nA:\nYes, if they email, reply via LI, or call the BDR directly, the BDR will need to check that the lead is in queue ownership. If so, they must move the account back to “Actively Working”, so that the lead can be put into their ownership.\nQ:\nWhy are my leads being reassigned to Inquiry Queue?\nA:\nMarketing Operations has a daily scheduled clean at 10:30 PM EST/EDT that update Status = Inquiry to Inquiry Queue. To prevent the reassignment, you’ll want to update the leads from Inquiry to Accepted or add to an Groove Flow.\nQ:\nWhat should BDRs do when a prospect or contact responds with a complince related question or objects to being contacted?\nA:\nImmediately reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help and forward any email from the contact to\ndpo@gitlab.com\n.\nQ:\nHow do I know if a lead is associated to a Partner Account and is being worked by a Partner?\nA:\nPartner leads will not be asigned to BDRs or SDRs as they will be assigned to the Partner Queue. To tell whether a lead is associated to a Partner Account, check their\nVartopia Partner Account\n- if it’s empty, you are may proceed with outreach.\nQ:\nWhen a partner lead is assigned to Partner, when and how can we recall the lead?\nA:\nPartner lead will be recalled after a certain period of time if they are not accepted by Partners for joint marketing campaigns. They will be initially be recalled with a Recycle status, once they become MQL, they will be assigned to BDRs or SDRs. For more information on this process, see the\nVartopia handbook page\n.\nAnnouncement Common Questions\nThere are three deciding factors on what channel you should use for your announcement:\nUrgency: How crucial is it that the Sales Dev Org or team/teams see this announcement right now?\nWho: The entire Sales Dev Org, SDR/BDRs, or a specific SalesDev Team\nImpact: How much does it impact the audience’s ability to sell and create SAOs?\nAnnouncement Channels\nEmail Newsletter\nWeekly Team Meetings\nSales Dev FYI Slack Channel\nMonthly All Hands Meeting\nSpecific Team Slack Channels\nDecision Grid\nNot Time Sensitive or Important\nImportant and/or Time Sensitive\nImpacts Multiple Teams\nEmail Newsletter, Weekly Team Meeting\nSales Dev FYI Slack, All Hands Meeting, Weekly Team Meeting, Email Newsletter\nOnly Impacts a Select Team\nWeekly Team Meeting\nSales Dev FYI Slack, Team Channel Slack, Weekly Team Meeting\nQualifiers by Channel\nQualifier(s)\nSales Dev Global Slack\nShoutouts, Questions, Concerns, Share something that’s working, Fun for Multiple Teams, New Team Members\nSales Dev FYI Slack\nAnnouncements and Reminders that involve multiple teams or are of high importance\nEmail Newsletter\nImpacts Multiple Teams\nAll Hands Meeting\nImportant updates that affect multiple teams\nWeekly Team Meeting\nAny updates that affect that specific team\nTeam Slack Channels\nImportant or Time Sensitive, but only related to that specific team\nKPIs and SLAs\nRamping Periods and Lead Routing\nLevels\nDetails\nOnboarding\n- Timeframe: Month 0 - Parameters: SDR not on quota, leads are off in Traction, Qualified is off\nRamping 1\n- Timeframe: Month 1 - Parameters: SDR is on 25% quota, leads are set at 50% in Traction, Qualified is off\nRamping 2\n- Timeframe: Month 2 - Parameters: SDR is on 50% quota, leads are set at 100% in Traction, Qualified is off\nRamping 3\n- Timeframe: Month 3 - Parameters: SDR is on 75% quota, leads are set at 100% in Traction, SDR is added to Qualified\nExpert\n- Timeframe: Months 4+ - Parameters: SDR is on full quota, leads are set at 100% in Traction, Qualified is on\n- SDR is now able to create their own Groove Flows pending approval.\nManagers can update MQL round robin pools in traction.

Our performance management process is deeply rooted in this philosophy. As we are building high-performing teams, it is important to understand that while we expect results, we also have expectations surrounding how we get to those results. Therefore, a performance management process will be initiated if a team member is not meeting their performance targets and/or is not adhering to their KPIs/SLAs. The idea behind our framework is to address issues promptly to ensure the long-lasting success of all team members.\nThe sections below will provide more details as to the performance management process on quota attainment as well as\nOur Three Pillars\nand KPIs/SLAs for inbound leads and outbound account management. While regular coaching is expected in weekly 1:1s, informal performance management will be initiated if a ramped team member has two consecutive months below 75-80%* attainment (SAOs, Stage 1 XDR Net ARR or Stage 3 Net ARR).\n*Range due to varied quotas\nSAOs and Stage 1 XDR Net ARR\nOnce the team member is informed, expectations will be:\nMonth 1: 75-80% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 2: 75-90% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nShould the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued.\nAfter the formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.\nStage 3 Net ARR\nAs a business we understand that Stage 3 Net ARR is a metric that can take time to influence. We are viewing Stage 3 Net ARR attainment as an indicator of healthy pipeline generation. Two consecutive months below monthly quota attainment suggests potential issues. Stage 3 Net ARR is a direct consequence of Stage 1 Net ARR. Therefore, performance management will focus on what can be immediately influenced by a team member: Stage 1 Net ARR (not Stage 1 XDR Net ARR stamped amounts, but real opportunity value: Stage 1 Net ARR).\nThe process, however, will\nstay the same: once the team member is informed, expectations will be:\nMonth 1: 80% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 2: 90% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nEffective in FY26, Net ARR generated from a Focus Account New Logo (First Order or New Connected) will be counted twice toward this attainment.\nShould the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued.\nAfter a  formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.\nOur Three Pillars\nTask\nDetails\n1. Uphold Daily Activity Metrics\n- Adhere to the two hour MQL SLA\n- Complete a minimum of 50 omni-channel activities per day (calls should total 200 per week, made during\nGolden Call\nhours and LinkedIn/email messages to be personalised)\n- Maintain an minimum of 2 discovery meetings weekly\n- Work lead records within Salesforce by leveraging relevant Flows tags in Groove.\n- Use Business Intelligence platforms like ZoomInfo or LinkedIn to verify the validity of inbound lead datapoints.

Please note that, other than\nSFDC lead views\n, inbound MQLs will also be flagged to you in a dedicated Slack alert channel. The official tracking of SLA times is done on SFDC, but you will also find an ‘Acknowledge’ button on the Slack notification that you can press so that it helps with daily check-ins with your Manager.\nMetric\nDescription\nResponse Time for leads\n- Net New MQLs: 2 work hours\n- Inbound Responses: 8 work hours\nLow vs High Touch Groove Flow Usage\n- Over 70% of inbound leads enrolled to High Touch Flows.\nInbound tasks past due per day\n- No more than 10% of tasks pending per day.\n- 90% of tasks to be properly completed, not skipped.\nTwo way conversations\n- 50 per week.\nOutbound Account Management\nIn addition to the above, BDR team members are expected to:\nMetric\nDescription\nVolume of Actively Working Accounts per Quarter\n- Enterprise:\n- 75 AWA’d accounts per BDR per Quarter, measured per Actively Working Start Date.\n- 65 6QAd accounts per Quarter, per BDR.\n- Mid-Market:\n- 125 AWA’d accounts per BDR per Quarter, measured per Actively Working Start Date.\n- 25 6QA’d accounts per Quarter, per BDR.\nResearch Quality\n>80% usage of Intent tools on AWA’d accounts, with high propensity to purchase indicators showed.\nVolume of Prospects per Account\n5-10 prospects added to Groove Flow per account, whose titles and personas match our ICPs.\n6QA Account Review\nAll automatically 6QA’d accounts to be reviewed, and either accepted or rejected, within 48 hours.\nPTO and Flexible Working\nSales Development Organization Time Off\nIn accordance with the\nTime Off Policy\n, you need give your manager a heads up early of your intended time off so that they can help arrange cover for your tasks, if necessary.\nWe want to help our team members being able to fully unplug from work during their PTO, while not having to worry about their workload or target attainment. Based on this, we have created this PTO Territory Planning Issue that you can use to strategize your work and be aligned to the GitLab value of being a\nManager of One.\nTo log a PTO Territory Planning request, please go to the Issue list on the SDR GitLab project\nhere\nand choose\nPTO_Coverage_Template\nfrom the Description drop-down list. All of these requests are then managed through the board here. and all next steps and guidelines are on the issue description.\nFlexible working\nAt GitLab we have flexible working hours. This means that you can organize your working day as you like and are not expected to arrive and leave at a set time every day, but we do expect MQL’s to be followed up within 1 hour (during business hours) so communication with your manager will be necessary if you plan to be out for an extended period of time. Managers will provide direction on the routing of leads during that time.\nWith a prospect-facing role in Sales Development, do keep in mind when you are calling and emailing prospects:\nThe best times to call are early and late in the business day, so these may be best blocked for this activity.\nGroove allows you to schedule emails at set times. For outbound prospecting, the most effective emails are those that come in the early morning and early evening, so you can take advantage of this feature. On the other hand, inbound MQL’s must be handled regularly throughout your day as they come in.\nLunchtimes are good for outreach as most prospects have meeting blocks for three hours in the morning and then two hours mid-afternoon.\nThe above blocks you can use for account research and planning, customer meetings, or meetings with your sales reps, manager, peers, and teams.\nAlthough you are not expected to start work and end work at the same time every day, please do keep in mind the normal business hours of your prospects, and make sure to schedule your own working hours to ensure you maximize opportunities.\nIn short, working at GitLab means that if you start the day early you can take a long lunch break to hit the gym or go grocery shopping in the middle of the day when it’s quiet, yet you can still do a full day’s work around that and don’t need to be accountable all the time, as long as you are available to call prospects and be available for prospect meetings during normal working hours for your region/territory.\nTanuki Tech\nTanuki Tech (short for Tanuki Instutite of Technology) is the world class sales/technology bootcamp that we are provide for the sales development organization. Use this page to walk through the courses and examinations that you'll be expected to complete as part of your tenure in our organisation.\nLast modified July 9, 2025:\nUpdate 6QA guidance (\n6b903c81\n)\nView page source\n-\nEdit this page\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.",
