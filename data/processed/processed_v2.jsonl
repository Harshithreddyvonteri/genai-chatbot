{"doc_id": "fdb2927c2e2f9845", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values", "title": "GitLab Values | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nLearn more about how we live our values at GitLab\nGitLab‚Äôs six core values are\nü§ù Collaboration\n,\nüìà Results for Customers\n,\n‚è±Ô∏è Efficiency\n,\nüåê Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging\n,\nüë£ Iteration\n, and\nüëÅÔ∏è Transparency\n,\nand together they spell the\nwe give each other by assuming\ngood intent. We react to them\nwith values emoji\nand they are made actionable below.\nAbout our values\nWe take inspiration from other companies, and we always go for the\nboring solutions\n. Our co-founder, Sid Sijbrandij, has\nshared the origin\nof each of the CREDIT values, but\njust like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better.\nIn many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned (and scars earned) in the course of doing business.\nWe used to have more values, but it was difficult to remember them all. In response, we condensed them, created an acronym (CREDIT), and listed operating principles to guide behavior.\nEveryone is welcome to suggest improvements. Please assign MRs to update these values to our\nChief People Officer\nand if you work at GitLab, also @mention them in the\n#values\nSlack channel\n.\nDriving Results with CREDIT\nfrom\nGitLab\non\nVimeo\n.\nü§ù Collaboration\nTo achieve results, team members must work together effectively. At GitLab, helping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve.\nSimilarly, you can rely on others for help and advice‚Äîin fact, you‚Äôre expected to do so.\nAnyone can chime in on any subject, including people who don‚Äôt work at GitLab.\nThe person who‚Äôs responsible for the work decides how to do it,\nbut they should always take each suggestion seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented.\nKindness\nWe value caring for others.\nDemonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback.\nKindness doesn‚Äôt mean holding back on feedback or avoiding disagreements, these are crucial to professional growth and getting results for customers.\nKindness means you make a separation between the work and the person, you can criticize someone‚Äôs work but still be respectful to the person.\nGive as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way.\nShare\nThere are aspects of GitLab culture, such as intentional transparency, that are unintuitive to outsiders and new team members.\nBe willing to invest in people and engage in open dialogue.\nFor example, consider making private issues public wherever possible so that we can all learn from the experience. Don‚Äôt be afraid of judgement or scrutiny when sharing publicly, we all understand\nit‚Äôs impossible to know everything\n.\nEveryone can\nremind\nanyone in the company about our values.\nIf there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.\nShare problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and\nspeak up\n.\nNegative feedback is 1-1\nGive negative feedback in the smallest setting possible.\nOne-on-one video calls are preferred.\nNegative\nfeedback\nis distinct from negativity and disagreement. If there is no direct feedback involved, strive to discuss disagreement\nin a public channel\n, respectfully and\ntransparently\n.\nIn a\nGitLab Unfiltered interview on values\n, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.\nWe deal with negative all the time at GitLab. If it‚Äôs not a problem, then why are we discussing it? We deal with negativity a lot, and that‚Äôs also part of our ambition.\nIf you want to get better, you talk about what you can improve. We‚Äôre allowed to publicly discuss negative things; we‚Äôre not allowed to give negative feedback in a large setting if it could be feasibly administered in a smaller setting.\nNegative feedback can be given in a group setting if it‚Äôs to someone higher in the management chain. This shows that no one is above feedback.\nProvide feedback in a timely manner\nWe want to solve problems while they are\nsmall\n.\nIf you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer), please voice your concerns rather than keeping them to yourself. If you need to escalate beyond your manager, you could consider speaking to your\nskip-level\n, a more senior person, or a\npeople business partner\n.\nSay thanks\nRecognize the people that helped you publicly, for example in our\n#thanks chat channel\n.\nWhen publicly thanking, it‚Äôs important to recognize the following:\nShowing thanks in as large a setting as possible (company-wide) at a company as large as ours is the exception instead of the norm, it takes some getting used to.\nBeing thanked at the company level for what you view as a relatively small or minuscule contribution can feel awkward.\nThanking a person in\n#thanks\nshould be done sincerely and summarize why you are thankful so the person on the receiving end can easily understand why they are being thanked. Even while\nassuming positive intent\n, not all folks are comfortable with public praise. Help this person understand how they went above and beyond and why you felt it was important for the team member to be recognized.\nThere are a number of good ways and places to say thanks. We shouldn‚Äôt limit saying thanks to just the\n#thanks\nchannel\n.\nGive feedback effectively\nGiving feedback is challenging, but it‚Äôs important to deliver it effectively.\nWhen providing feedback, always make it about the work itself;\nfocus on the business impact and not the person.\nMake sure to provide at least one clear and recent example.\nIf a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account.\nAn example of giving positive feedback is our\nthanks chat channel\n.\nFor managers, it‚Äôs important to realize that team members react to a negative incident with their managers\nsix times more strongly\nthan they do to a positive one.\nKeeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself.\nIn the situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose for that feedback: to improve the team member‚Äôs performance going forward.\nGive recognition generously, in the open, and often to\ngenerate more engagement\nfrom your team.\nGet to know each other\nWe use a lot of\ntext-based communication\n, and if you know the person behind the text, it will be easier to prevent conflicts.\nSo we encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through\ninformal communication\n, for example, virtual\ncoffee chats\n, and during\nGitLab Summit\n.\nReach across company departments\nWhile it‚Äôs wise to seek advice from experts within your function, we encourage GitLab team members to do the same across departments. This enables the company to iterate more quickly, embrace the understanding that everyone can contribute and include more diverse perspectives when possible.\nDon‚Äôt pull rank\nIf you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you‚Äôre doing something wrong.\nPeople already know\nour decision-making process\n.\nExplain why you‚Äôre making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function.\nThis includes using the rank of another person -\nincluding the CEO\n- to sell an idea or decision.\nAssume positive intent\nWe naturally have a double standard when it comes to the actions of others.\nWe blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but individuals for theirs.\nThis double standard is called the\nFundamental Attribution Error\n.\nIn order to mitigate this bias, you should always\nassume positive intent\nin your interactions with others, respecting their expertise and giving them grace in the face of what you might perceive as mistakes.\nWhen\ndisagreeing\n, folks sometimes argue against the weakest points of an argument, or an imaginary argument (e.g.\n‚Äústraw man‚Äù\n). Assume the points are presented in good faith, and instead try to argue against the strongest version of your opponent‚Äôs position. We call this arguing against a ‚Äústeel‚Äù position, instead of a ‚Äústraw‚Äù one. This concept is borrowed from\nargue the ‚Äústeel man‚Äù\ntechnique.\nA ‚Äústeel‚Äù position should be against the absolute most effective version of your opponent‚Äôs position ‚Äî potentially even more compelling than the one they presented. A good ‚Äústeel‚Äù position is one where the other person feels you‚Äôve represented their position well, even if they still disagree with your assumptions or conclusion.\nAddress behavior, but don‚Äôt label people\nThere is a lot of good in\nthis article\nabout not wanting jerks on our team, but we believe that\njerk\nis a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person.  We avoid classifications.\nSay sorry\nIf you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible.\nSaying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength.\nThe people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes.\nAdditionally, when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else.\nMistakes can include when you have not been kind to someone. In order to reinforce our values, it is important, and takes more courage, to apologize publicly when you have been unkind publicly (e.g., when you have said something unkind or unprofessional to an individual or group in a Slack channel).\nNo ego\nDon‚Äôt defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake.\nYou are not your work; you don‚Äôt have to defend your point.\nYou do have to search for the right answer with help from others.\nIn a GitLab Unfiltered\ninterview\n, GitLab Head of Remote Darren M. adds context on this operating principle.\nIn many organizations, there‚Äôs a subtle, low-level, persistent pressure to continually prove your worth.\nAnd I believe that this fuels imposter syndrome and wreaks havoc on\nmental health\n.\nWhat‚Äôs so troubling to me is how often perception is reality.\nIn other words, those who have mastered the art of being perceived as elite reap benefits, though this has nothing to do with actual results.\nAt GitLab, ‚Äúno ego‚Äù means that we foster and support an environment where results matter, and you‚Äôre given agency to approach your work in the way that makes sense to you.\nInstead of judging people for not approaching work in an agreed-upon way, ‚Äúno ego‚Äù encourages people to glean inspiration from watching others approach work in new and different ways.\nSee others succeed\nA candidate who has talked to a lot of people inside GitLab said that, compared to other companies, one thing stood out the most: everyone here mentioned wanting to see each other succeed.\nDon‚Äôt let each other fail\nKeep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck.\nIf you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist. This might involve offering to\npair program\nor setting up a sync brainstorming session. The goal is to connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance.\nWe are a team, so we succeed and shine together by supporting each other!\nPeople are not their work\nAlways make suggestions about examples of work, not the person.\nSay ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt respond to my feedback about the design‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou never listen‚Äù.\nAnd, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve, and that others giving you feedback want to see you succeed.\nDo it yourself\nOur collaboration value is about helping each other when we have questions, need critique, or need help.\nNo need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or\ndo with two what you can do yourself\n. The Bolt Handbook refers to this as the\nFounder Mentality\n, where all team members should approach the problem as if they own the company.\nBlameless problem solving\nInvestigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure‚Äôs mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure, rather than cast blame on a person or team.\nWe hold blameless\nroot cause analyses\nand\nretrospectives\nfor stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.\nShort toes\nPeople joining the company frequently say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to step on anyone‚Äôs toes.‚Äù\nAt GitLab, we should be more accepting of people taking initiative in trying to improve things.\nAs companies grow, their speed of decision-making goes down since there are more people involved.\nWe should counteract that by having short toes and feeling comfortable letting others contribute to our domain.\nFor example, pointed, respectful feedback to a\nproposal\nby GitLab‚Äôs CEO led to his own merge request being closed. However, it is not required to respond to comments.\nIt‚Äôs impossible to know everything\nWe know we must rely on others for the expertise they have that we don‚Äôt.\nIt‚Äôs OK to admit you don‚Äôt know something and to ask for help, even if doing so makes you feel vulnerable.\nIt is never too late to ask a question, and by doing so, you can get the information you need to produce results and to strengthen your own skills as well as GitLab as a whole.\nAfter your question is answered,\nplease document the answer so that it can be shared\n.\nDon‚Äôt display surprise when people say they don‚Äôt know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù\n(As inspired by\nRecurse\n.)\nCollaboration is not consensus\nWhen collaborating, it is always important to stay above radar and work\ntransparently\n, but collaboration is\nnot consensus\nand disagreement is part of collaboration.\nYou don‚Äôt need to ask people for their input, and they shouldn‚Äôt ask you ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you ask me?‚Äù.\nYou don‚Äôt have to wait for people to provide input, if you did ask them.\nYou don‚Äôt need to have everyone agreeing to the same thing - they can\ndisagree, commit, and advocate\n.\nTwo-way doors decisions\ncan be reversed as part of\ndisagree, commit, and advocate\n, while one-way door decisions benefit from more input. Recognize these reversible two-way door decisions for when less input is required to iterate faster.\nWe believe in permissionless innovation ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to involve people, but everyone can contribute.\nThis is core to how we\niterate\n, since we want smaller teams moving quickly rather than large teams achieving consensus slowly.\nCollaboration Competency\nCompetencies\nare the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.\nWe demonstrate collaboration when we take action to help others and include other‚Äôs (both internal and external) input (both help and feedback) to achieve the best possible outcome.\nGitLab Job Grade\nDemonstrates Collaboration Competency by‚Ä¶\nKnowledge Assessment\n5\nDevelops collaboration skills by learning from other team members\nKnowledge Assessment for Individual Contributors\n6\nGrows collaboration skills by using different types of communication; files issues appropriately, asks in the right Slack channels and uses the right labels.\n7\nModels collaborative behavior for fellow team members and others within the group.\n8\nCoaches team members on how to collaborate more effectively and pointing team members to the right channels to collaborate.\nKnowledge Assessment for People Leaders\n9\nFosters collaborative decision making and problem solving across the departments.\n10\nDrives team collaboration across divisions/departments, silos, and division boundaries.\n11\nDevelops networks and builds partnerships, engages in cross-functional activities; collaborates across boundaries, and finds common ground with a widening range of stakeholders.  Utilizes contacts to build and strengthen internal support base\n12\nLeads collaboration and teamwork in daily routines, prioritizing interactions, information sharing, and real time decision making across divisions/departments. Encourages greater cross-functional collaboration among e-team leaders.\n14\nChampions collaboration and teamwork into daily routines, prioritizing interactions, information sharing, and real time decision making across divisions/departments. Champions cross-functional collaboration among e-team leaders and GitLab.\nüìà Results for Customers\nWe exist to help our customers achieve more. Everything we do should be in service of making our customers successful with GitLab. Results for Customers is at the top of our values hierarchy, as our customers achieving results drives overall business performance that enables everything else.\nThe Results for Customers value is displayed through the following operating principles:\nSet Ambitious & Measurable goals\nWhile we iterate with small changes, we strive for large, ambitious results. We have an ambitious\nmission\nand\nvision\n, and we aim to be the best in the world across all our functions. Setting ambitious, measurable goals enables us to best deliver customer results.  We agree in writing on measurable goals. We have and report against\nKPIs\nwith guiding targets.\nUnderstand our customers\nAll GitLab team members should understand our customers‚Äô needs, issues, and value propositions. We understand how they use GitLab and what they need from a platform in order to meet their goals. Internally facing teams consider the impact of their work as it pertains indirectly to GitLab‚Äôs customers.\nWe better understand customers and their needs through:\nReviewing public facing GitLab issues from our customers and users\nDogfooding\nour product to understand the user experience\nReading customer stories from Marketing and Sales\nAttending Customer fireside chats\nLearning feedback from our customers and users on product features and roadmap\nCo-create\nWe create together with our customers. There is an open dialogue between GitLab and our customers so that we can better identify what they need. As a result of building a solution for them, we can also bring that solution to the world.\nKeep end users in sight\nOur focus is to increase customer results. At GitLab, one way to drive customer results is through platform enhancements that drive the most value for direct users. This requires being aware of\nthe Concur effect\n.\nArvind Narayanan\n, a Princeton Professor, described his frustration with Blackboard in a viral Tweet:\nIt has every feature ever dreamed up. But like anything designed by a committee, the interface is incoherent and any task requires at least fifteen clicks (and that‚Äôs if you even remember the correct sequence the first time).\nSoftware companies can be breathtakingly clueless when there‚Äôs a layer of indirection between them and their users. Everyone who‚Äôs suffered through Blackboard will have the same reaction to this: try having less functionality!\nRyan Falor\nfollowed up on Narayanan‚Äôs tweet with his definition of the Concur Effect:\ndecision makers are not direct users\nfeatures are overwhelming and disjointed\nuser experience gets worse over time\nSee\nthe Hacker News discussion\nfor a specific UX example.\nAt GitLab, we want to drive customer results through focusing on platform enhancements that drive the most value for direct users.\nCustomer results are more important\nthan:\nWhat we plan to make\n. If we focus only on our own plans, we would have only GitLab.com and no self-managed delivery of GitLab. This does not mean that we will agree to every feature request, but we won‚Äôt let existing plans be an obstacle to working on what will drive the most customer value.\nLarge customer requests\n. Catering to requests from large customers leads to the\ninnovator‚Äôs dilemma\n, we need to also focus on results for small and future customers.\nOur existing scope\n. For example, when customers asked for better integrations and complained about integration costs and effort, we responded by expanding our scope to create a\nsingle application\nfor the DevOps lifecycle.\nOur assumptions\n. Every company works differently, so we can‚Äôt assume that what works well for us will support our customers‚Äô needs. When we have an idea, we must directly validate our assumptions with multiple customers to ensure we create scalable, highly relevant solutions.\nWhat we control\n. We strive to provide the best possible experience for each of our customers, and take responsibility for all of the aspects that we can reasonably control.\nMeasure impact, not activity\nWe care about what you achieve: the code you shipped, the needle you moved, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon off shouldn‚Äôt feel like they did something wrong, unless it negatively impacted a goal or result they were responsible for. You don‚Äôt have to defend how you spend your day if you are performing and delivering against expectations. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules. We trust team members to show up and do their best work. Do not incite competition by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday. If you are working too many hours, talk to your manager to discuss solutions.\nDogfooding\nWe\nuse our own product\nin the way our users do to surface improvements that will lead to better\ncustomer results\n. GitLab is a DevSecOps Platform that can be used by people throughout the business. This is how we use it within GitLab. For example, we use our OKR functionality company-wide to inform product enhancements and for team members to have a great understanding of the customer experience. We also dogfood in the following ways:\nOur development organization uses GitLab.com to manage the DevOps lifecycle of GitLab itself.\nAll team members use GitLab to collaborate on this handbook.\nWe capture content and processes in Git repos and manage them with GitLab.\nWhen something breaks, doesn‚Äôt work well, or needs improvement, we are more likely to notice it internally and address it before it impacts our larger community.\nGive agency\nWe give people agency to focus on what they think is most beneficial. If a meeting doesn‚Äôt seem interesting and someone‚Äôs active participation is not critical to the outcome of the meeting, they can always opt to not attend, or during a video call they can work on other things if they want. Staying in the call may still make sense even if you are working on other tasks, so other peers can ping you and get fast answers when needed. This is particularly useful in multi-purpose meetings where you may be involved for just a few minutes.\nChallenger mindset\nChallenging the status quo can lead to remarkable results - we must never stop. A\nchallenger mindset\nrequires that we continually ask ourselves bold, difficult questions about our business and the problems we solve, while resisting complacency. To succeed we must innovate and delight our customers with the value of the products we build. A challenger mindset requires a relentless pursuit of excellence - we must be\ntenacious\n. Each win for our customers builds reputational capital we can use to earn the trust of prospects in a competitive market. While competition is a feature of capitalism, internally as GitLab team members, we must focus our efforts inwardly on achieving our very best results for customers to win market share.\nGrowth mindset\nYou don‚Äôt always get results and this will lead to criticism from yourself and/or others. We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, targeted training, learning from others, on-the-job experience, and receiving input from others. It is in our DNA as a company and individuals to look for opportunity, stay humble, and never settle. We try to hire people based on\ntheir trajectory, not their pedigree\n. We also strive to foster a culture of curiosity and continuous learning where team members are provided and proactively seek out opportunities to grow themselves and their careers. We believe that with the right expectations and direction, people can grow to take on new challenges and surpass expectations.\nCross-functional optimization\nOur definition of cross-functional optimization is that you do what is best for the organization as a whole. Don‚Äôt optimize for the goals of your team when it negatively impacts the goals of other teams, our users, and/or the company. Those goals are also your problem and your job. For example, you may have set a non-urgent functional milestone that is supposed to land at the end of the quarter. If delivering within the last week requires engagement from\nthe GTM teams\n, the right decision may be to push your own team‚Äôs target by a week to reduce the ask for the GTM team as the GTM focuses on meeting its revenue objectives.\nIn the context of\ncollaboration\n, if anyone is blocked by you on a question, your approval, or a merge request review, you should prioritize unblocking them, either directly or through helping them find someone else who can.\nEmbrace Tenacity\nWe refer to this as ‚Äúpersistence of purpose‚Äù. As talked about in\nThe Influence Blog\n, tenacity is the ability to display commitment to what you believe in. You keep picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and quickly get going again having learned a little more. We value the ability to maintain focus and motivation when work is tough and asking for help when needed.\nHave Ownership & Accountability\nWe expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. You are responsible for executing with attention to detail, connecting the dots across the organization and anticipating and solving problems. As an owner, you are responsible for overcoming challenges, not suppliers or other team members. Take initiative and proactively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve.\nSense of urgency\nTime gained or lost has compounding effects. Try to get the results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and\nways we communicate\n, so the compounding of results can begin and we can focus on the next improvement.\nOperate with a bias for action\nIt‚Äôs important that we keep our focus on action, and don‚Äôt fall into the trap of analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly. Try to get results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and ways of working\nDisagree, commit, and advocate\nWhen a decision is in place, we expect people to commit to executing it. Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed. This is\na common principle\n.\nEvery decision can be changed;\nour\nbest decision was one that changed an earlier one\n.\nIn a manager-report relationship, usually the report is the\nDirectly Responsible Individual\nThe manager may disagree with the final decision, but they still commit to the decision of the DRI.\nIn a group setting, participants may disagree with a proposal but not articulate their views for one reason or another. Sometimes,\nmany or all individuals may disagree yet choose not to speak up\n, because no one believes they would get agreement from the group. As a result, everyone loses out on their feedback.\nDissent\nis expression of that disagreement. However, it can be difficult and even socially expensive.\nExpression of feedback is a way for everyone to grow and learn, and is\nbased on facts rather than opinions\n. Share your perspective, rather than agreeing simply to avoid conflict or to go along with everyone else.\nWhen you want to reopen the conversation on something, show that your argument is informed by previous conversations and\nassume the decision was made with the best intent\n.\nYou have to achieve results on every decision while it stands, even when you are trying to have it changed.\nYou should communicate with the\nwho can change the decision instead of someone who can‚Äôt.\nEscalate to unblock\nIf there is a disagreement and you can‚Äôt move forward because of it, agree to escalate and escalate to one or both of your managers. Early escalation, delivered with context of the challenge, enables managers to function as an unblocker.\nResults Competency\nCompetencies\nare the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.\nWe demonstrate results when we do what we promised to each other, customers, users, and investors.\nGitLab Job Grade\nDemonstrates Results Competency by‚Ä¶\nKnowledge Assessment\n5\nDevelops the skills needed to commit and execute on agreed actions.\nKnowledge Assessment for Individual Contributors\n6\nApplies commitment to results and demonstrates ability to execute on agreed actions.\n7\nModels a sense of urgency and commitment to deliver results.\n8\nCoaches team members to collaborate and work iteratively towards impact with the focus on the outcome and not activity worked.\nKnowledge Assessment for People Leaders\n9\nFosters a culture of ownership of personal performance.\n10\nDrives efficient execution of results ensuring collaboration between team members.\n11\nDevelops quarterly OKR's ensuring the performance and results of one or more teams.\n12\nLeads the achievement of results while driving the continued alignment to our values of collaboration, efficiency, diversity, iteration and transparency.\n‚è±Ô∏è Efficiency\nAt GitLab, efficiency means producing\nresults\nwithout wasting materials, time, or energy. We optimize solutions globally for the broader GitLab community over one person or a small group. Focus on efficiency should be global in nature, not just local to a given function. Global efficiency could include efficiency with customers, candidates, and contributors as well. It is easy to prioritize consistency over efficiency because consistency is often more efficient initially and makes managing processes more efficient. We should slow down when optimizing for consistency. Taking a company-wide lens when evaluating changes will help ensure that new processes will improve efficiency for GitLab as a whole and be the best decision for the company as a whole.\nWhen we work internally with other team members, we leverage GitLab‚Äôs unique working practices and operating principles to achieve top efficiency. We do not expect people outside of GitLab to conform to GitLab‚Äôs ways of working, and we will make accommodations to work effectively with them. For example, we may collaborate heavily in-person and not default to async communications.\nOnly Healthy Constraints\nMost companies regress to the mean and slow down over time. While some changes are required as a company grows and matures, not all change is inevitable or should be allowed to passively happen. As GitLab grows, we are conscious of how we operate and how it enables our ability to continue to operate with the agility of a\nstartup\n. We try to limit ourselves to\nhealthy constraints\n.\nWrite things down\nWe document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues.\nWe do that because ‚Äú\nthe faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory\n.‚Äù\nIt is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it.\nBoring solutions\nUse the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that\n‚Äúboring‚Äù\nshould\nnot be conflated with ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äútechnical debt.‚Äù\nThe speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps.\nDon‚Äôt pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun;\nusing established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.\nMake a conscious effort to\nrecognize\nthe constraints of others within the team.\nFor example, sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization, and development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future.\nSelf-service and self-learning\nTeam members should first\nsearch for their own answers\nand, if an answer is not readily found or the answer is not clear, ask in public as we all should have a\nlow level of shame\n.\nWrite down any new information discovered\nand pay it forward so that those coming after will have better efficiency built on top of practicing collaboration, inclusion, and documenting the results.\nTeam members have more room to grow themselves when they are able to self-service and self-learn.\nEfficiency for the right group\nOptimize solutions globally for the broader GitLab community. As an example, it may be best to discard a renewal process that requires thousands of customers to each spend two hours in favor of one that only takes sixty seconds, even when it may make a monthly report less efficient internally! In a decision, ask yourself ‚ÄúFor whom does this need to be most efficient?‚Äù Quite often, the answer may be your users, contributors, customers, or team members that are dependent upon your decision.\nBe respectful of others‚Äô time\nConsider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.\nSpend company money like it‚Äôs your own\nEvery dollar we spend will have to be earned back. Be as frugal with company money as you are with your own. In saying this, we ask team members to weigh the cost of purchases against the value that they will bring to the company.\nConsider the degree to which a purchase increases your ability to better accomplish your work and achieve business\nresults\nrelative to cost. Lowering overhead reduces the cost to operate the business and lets us shift spend toward other priority areas.\nWe have\nguidelines\naround this operating principle to help team members better understand our expensing process and expectations.\nFrugality\nAmazon states it best\nwith: ‚ÄúAccomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.‚Äù\nShort verbal answers\nGive short answers to verbal questions so the other party has the opportunity to ask more or move on.\nKeep broadcasts short\nKeep one-to-many written communication short, as mentioned in\nthis HBR study\n: ‚ÄúA majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it‚Äôs too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise.‚Äù\nManagers of one\nWe want each team member to be\na manager of one\nwho doesn‚Äôt need daily check-ins to achieve their goals. Team members are given the freedom to own projects and initiatives and are trusted to see them through to a successful end.\nWhen team members are managers of one they can have an increased work/life balance, because they are more empowered to make decisions around how they allocate their time throughout each day.\nFreedom and responsibility over rigidity\nWhen possible, we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes. You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. Freedom and responsibility are more efficient than rigidly following a process,\nor creating interdependencies\n, because they enable faster decision velocity and higher rates of\niteration\n.\nWhen team members have freedom and responsibility over rigidity, they have more room to help others.\nAccept mistakes\nNot every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one. Once you have accepted the mistake, learn from it. When team members are free to accept mistakes, they can take more calculated risks.\nMove fast by shipping the minimal valuable change\nWe value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is not the\nsmallest viable and valuable thing\n, cut the scope.\nEmbrace change\nAdoption of features, user requirements, and the competitive landscape change frequently and rapidly. The most successful companies adapt their roadmap and their organization quickly to keep pace. One of the things that makes this challenging is the impact on our team. People may need to change teams, subject matter, or even who manages them. This can rightly feel disruptive. If we coach ourselves to embrace the positive aspects of change, such as increased opportunity and new things to learn, we can move faster as a company and increase our odds of success. It is important to\nhold management accountable for being deliberate\n.\nEfficiency Competency\nCompetencies\nare the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.\nWe demonstrate efficiency when we work on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work.\nGitLab Job Grade\nDemonstrates Efficiency Competency by‚Ä¶\nKnowledge Assessment\n5\nDevelops an understanding of being a manager of 1 by taking responsibility for your own tasks and delivering on commitments. Brings up ideas for process improvements to 1:1s. Learns to write everything down as it is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain.\nKnowledge Assessment for Individual Contributors\n6\nDevelops a deeper understanding of efficiency and actively identifies process inefficiencies within the team. Seeks out ways to be more effective in their role, while also starting to mentor others in ways to work efficiently.\n7\nModels a culture of efficiency within the team where people make good, timely decisions using available data and assessing multiple alternatives. Models using boring solutions for increasing the speed of innovation for our organization and product.\n8\nTakes ownership of own team process inefficiencies, implements cross team efforts in ensuring things are running smoothly. Implements a way of working in the team where team members first search for their own answers and, if an answer is not readily found or the answer is not clear, ask in public as we all should have a low level of shame.\nKnowledge Assessment for People Leaders\n9\nTakes ownership of group level process inefficiencies and guides cross sub-departments in ensuring things are running smoothly. Fosters a culture in the sub-departments where you respect others' time and promote self-service and self-learning.\n10\nDrives the framework of frugality on a department level and owns departments efforts in ensuring things are running smoothly. Drives efficient resolution of highly complex or unusual business problems that impact the department / team. Holds their managers and peers accountable for upholding this value.\n11\nDevelops the framework and strategy of frugality cross division resulting in efforts ensuring things are running smoothly. Develops leaders to action on division/department/team inefficiencies. Hold their management teams accountable for upholding this value.\n12\nLeads with efficiency across the company. Ensures efficient resource allocation decisions across the company. Leads across company strategy and policy improvements that move the business towards more efficiency. They hold their senior management and the e-group accountable for upholding this value.\nChampions GitLab's strategy for efficiency internally and externally. Constantly looking for efficiency improvements cross company and holding other e-group members accountable for upholding efficiency too. They are comfortable leading through frugality and accepting of mistakes.\nüåê Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging\nDiversity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to the success of GitLab. We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to build a culture that is\ninclusive\nand supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in our community and company.\nBias towards asynchronous communication\nTake initiative to operate\nasynchronously\nwhenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who may not be in the same time zone, are traveling outside of their usual time zone, or are\nstructuring their day\naround pressing commitments at home or in their community.\nThis is demonstrated by communicating recordings of\nmeetings\n, using GitLab Issues and Merge Requests rather than texts, calls, or Slack messages, and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses. Encourage others to default to\ndocumentation\nrather than pressuring others to be online outside of their working hours.\nEmbracing uncomfortable ideas and conversations\nPart of embracing diversity is a willingness to embrace often uncomfortable conversations and situations. This concept is also at the core of inclusion and helping to eliminate the problems that are faced by certain GitLab team members who may not be in the majority.\nWe believe that being willing to embrace discomfort is the path forward to a safe, balanced and inclusive work place for all. Challenge yourself, challenge your own pre-set notions and ideas about different cultures or things you don‚Äôt understand. When we are willing to embrace being uncomfortable, we can focus on actually fixing the issues at hand rather than simply ‚Äúappearing to care‚Äù.\nUnderstanding the impact of microaggressions\nMicroaggressions are much more than merely rude or insensitive comments. They can wear people down by slowly chipping away their sense of belonging/safety/inclusion over time. What is a microaggression?\n‚ÄúThe everyday slights, indignities, put downs and insults that people of color, women, LGBT populations or those who are marginalized experiences in their day-to-day interactions with people.‚Äù -  Derald W. Sue\nAt GitLab we believe that everyone is entitled to a safe working space where they can express who they are and participate in conversations without worry of being spoken to in a harmful way, given that we want to encourage everyone to be mindful of what is a microaggression and be mindful of their potential impact.\nSeek diverse perspectives\nWe believe that team members seeking feedback from a diverse group of team members, inside and outside of their group or function, leads to better decisions and a greater sense of team member belonging. For more guidance on how we define Diversity, please refer to\nGitLab‚Äôs definition of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging\n. Feedback from a more heterogenous group often leads to better business outcomes as we incorporate diverse perspectives and uncover unconscious bias.\nAn example of this operating principle in action showcases the value of actively seeking diverse perspectives. The term ‚ÄúBrag Document‚Äù was used to describe when individuals documented their accomplishments. Documenting accomplishments is critical to team member development. However, team members had the\npsychological safety\nto raise the question of whether or not the title of the document made some feel uncomfortable. In an effort to seek a\ndiverse perspective\n, a survey was conducted in one of the\nTeam Member and Advocacy Resource Group (TMRG)\nchannels. The poll results showed that 100% of those polled preferred a different title and the title was changed.\nMake family feel welcome\nOne of the unique elements to an\nall-remote culture\nis the ability to visit a person‚Äôs home while collaborating. If the tenor of the meeting allows, feel welcome to invite your family members or pets to drop by and greet your colleagues. Be mindful of language and use of profanity to encourage a family-friendly environment.\nShift working hours for a cause\nCaregiving, outreach programs, and community service do not conveniently wait for regular business hours to conclude. If there‚Äôs a cause or community effort taking place, feel welcome to work with your manager and shift your working hours to be available during a period where you‚Äôll have the greatest impact for good. For colleagues supporting others during these causes, document everything and strive to post recordings so it‚Äôs easy for them to catch up.\nBe a mentor\nPeople feel more included when they‚Äôre supported. To encourage this, and to support diversified learning across departments, consider GitLab‚Äôs\nInternship for Learning\nprogram.\nCulture fit is a bad excuse\nvalues fit\n, not a culture fit.\nWe want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity. Said differently:\n‚Äúculture add‚Äù > ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù\nor ‚Äúhire for culture contribution‚Äù since our\nmission is that everyone can contribute\n.\nReligion and politics at work\nWe generally avoid discussing politics or religion in public forums because it is easy to alienate people that have a minority opinion. This doesn‚Äôt mean we never discuss these topics. Because we value diversity, inclusion and belonging, and want all team members to feel welcome and contribute equally, we encourage free discussion of operational decisions that can move us toward being a more inclusive company.\nThere is sometimes a grey area where advocating for diversity and political activities may intersect. Team members should use discretion in grey area communications, because a culture of belonging requires us to be respectful of the broad spectrum of views within our work environment. What does this mean in practice? Please feel empowered to share information that highlights diversity, inclusion and belonging issues and how GitLab and GitLab team members can get involved. In line with our\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n, avoid posting articles that reference specific political figures or parties.\nWhile it is acceptable for individuals to bring up politics and religion in social contexts such as coffee chats and real-life meetups with other coworkers (with the goal to understand and not judge), always be aware of potential sensitivities, exercise your best judgment, and make sure you stay within the boundaries of our\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n.\nWe‚Äôre a global company where perspectives and local norms may differ from culture to culture. Diversity, inclusion and belonging is about broad inclusion at a worldwide level. If there is a question or concern, please reach out to\ndiversityinclusion@gitlab.com\nor\n#diversity_inclusion_and_belonging\n.\nQuirkiness\nUnexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting.\nCelebrate and encourage quirky gifts, habits, behavior, and points of view. Open source is a great way to interact with interesting people. We try to hire people who think work is a great way to express themselves.\nBuilding a safe community\nDo\nnot\nmake jokes or unfriendly remarks about\ncharacteristics of the people who make up GitLab and how they identify\n.\nEveryone has the right to feel safe when working for GitLab and/or as a part of the GitLab community.\nWe do not tolerate abuse,\nharassment\n, exclusion, discrimination, or retaliation by/of any community members, including our team members.\nYou can always\nrefuse\nto deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.\nUnconscious bias\nWe recognize that unconscious bias is something that affects everyone and that the\neffect it has on us as humans and our company is large.\nWe are responsible for understanding our own implicit biases and helping others\nunderstand theirs. We are continuously\nworking on getting better at this topic\n.\nInclusive benefits\nWe list our\nParental Leave\npublicly so people don‚Äôt have to ask during interviews.\nInclusive language & pronouns\nUse\ninclusive\nlanguage.\nFor example, prefer ‚ÄúHi everybody‚Äù or ‚ÄúHi people‚Äù to ‚ÄúHi guys‚Äù, and ‚Äúthey‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhe/she‚Äù. While there are several good guides from folks like\n18f\n,\nUniversity of Calgary\n, and\nBuffer\non using inclusive language, we don‚Äôt keep an exhaustive list.\nWhen new possibly non-inclusive words arise, we prefer to be proactive and look for an alternative.\nIf your goal is to be inclusive, it is more effective to make a small adjustment in the vocabulary when some people have a problem with it, rather than making a decision to not change it because some people don‚Äôt think it is a problem.\nAnd if you make a mistake (e.g. accidentally using the wrong pronoun or an outdated phrase), acknowledge it,\napologize gracefully and move on\n; there is no need to dwell on it, and you can work to avoid making that mistake in the future.\nPlease also visit our\nGender and Sexual-orientation Identity Definitions and FAQ\npage if you have questions around pronouns and other topics related to gender / sexual orientation.\nLearn how to pronounce other people‚Äôs names\nWe attach part of our identity to our names, and if it is mispronounced it can feel less inclusive.\nIf it happens repeatedly, you may be unintentionally sending a message to that person that you are not interested\nin learning how to pronounce their name correctly. This applies to everyone you are in contact with:\nteam members, customers, candidates for jobs, and anyone else.\nPeople whose name is repeatedly mispronounced might feel unimportant or self-conscious, and might not\nspeak up about it.\nOther negative behaviors include giving a person a nickname without their permission, or\nactively avoiding using their name in sync calls.\nIt might be challenging to pronounce names from a different language or culture than your\nown, but with some effort, name pronunciation can be learned by anyone. Some ways to achieve this are:\nAsk the person for help in a private space: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt think I am pronouncing your name correctly. Can you help me with the correct pronunciation?‚Äù\nUse the written and recorded pronunciation tools in Slack.\nUse online tools such as videos recorded on YouTube or\nNameShouts\n.\nPractice the pronunciation with a friend or team member who knows the correct pronunciation.\nAlways avoid making jokes or comments about how it is difficult to pronounce their name.\nUse of nicknames\nSome people might choose to use a nickname, for example: ‚ÄúBob‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù.\nAs long as this is their choice this is perfectly acceptable.\nWe should avoid assigning a nickname to a person without their permission.\nSlack pronunciation features\nSlack has two features to help with this issue: the phonetic name pronunciation field and the ability to record your own name pronunciation audio clip. We encourage all team members to complete both of these. Update them by\nediting your profile\n.\nInclusive interviewing\nThis is documented on our page about\ninterviewing\n.\nInclusive meetings\nBe consciously inclusive in\nmeetings\nby giving everyone present an opportunity to talk and present their points of view. This can be especially important in a remote setting.\nWith internal meetings, consider using an agenda document for questions. For example, with GitLab\nAMAs\n, every meeting has a numbered list that GitLab team members can add questions to. During the meeting, questions are answered in turn and discussions noted in the same document. Sometimes, these documents can have so much traffic (during the meeting) such that only a limited number of people can edit the document. In these situations, those who have questions should post on zoom chat and those who can edit the document should help copy the question over to the document. In addition, those who can edit the document should also post in zoom chat to see if anyone has any questions that they could help add to the document so that meeting attendees are more empowered to contribute to the conversation.\nCustomers are not used to working in this way. To promote inclusion with customers: ask participants for their goals; make sure during demos that you pause for question; leave time for discussion.\nInclusive and fair policy to regions with fewer employees\nBeing globally distributed has the benefit that someone can cover for you when you are off work. However, population density is not balanced across timezones. Policies should remain fair to those in less dense regions.\nFor example, the Asia Pacific region covers more timezones but has fewer team members. If we use an algorithm to assign tasks to those in later timezones, all American tasks would fall on the fewer Asia Pacific employees. This can damage belonging and inclusivity and should be avoided.\nWhen planning an event, the organizer should cater for location density differences to maximize participation in all regions.\nSee Something, Say Something\nAs a globally-dispersed company, we have team members from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means it is important for each of us to use great judgment in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes not fully realize we have said or done something to offend someone. It is important that our teammates hold each other accountable and let them know if they have unintentionally or intentionally done something so they can learn and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don‚Äôt feel excluded or minimized by the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn‚Äôt respectful or inclusive.\nEmbracing Neurodiversity\nNeurodiversity\nrefers to variations in the human brain regarding learning, attention, sociability, mood, and other mental functions. There are various neurodevelopmental conditions, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, bipolarity, and other styles of neurodivergent functioning. While neurodivergent individuals often bring\nunique skills and abilities\nwhich can be harnessed for a\ncompetitive advantage\nin many fields (for example,\ncybersecurity\n), neurodivergent individuals are often discriminated against. Due to non-inclusive hiring practices, they sometimes have trouble making it through traditional hiring processes. Neurodiversity inclusion best practices benefit everyone, and at GitLab, everyone can contribute. The handbook, values, strategy, and interviewing processes must support the ability for everyone to thrive.\nAt GitLab we embrace Neurodiversity through adopting a variety of different work styles and communication styles, and we lean into\ntransparency\n, asynchronous as a default working style, and pre-filled meeting agendas. These best practices become even more important when embracing neurodiversity. Providing multiple ways to consume information (written / video / audio) allows everyone to contribute independent of their preferred comprehension style. It is important to ask team members specifically what their preferred communication method is in order to provide them information in a format that is easily consumable for them.\nRemember,\nbrains work differently\nand always\nassume positive intent\n, even if someone behaves in an unexpected way. While it may be an unexpected behavior to you, it may not be unexpected to the individual exhibiting the behavior. That is the beauty and value of diversity, embracing differences and becoming stronger and better as a result.\nWe also recommend that all team members review the\nReasonable Accommodation\nprocess. A Reasonable Accommodation for a team member could include noise-cancelling headphones, scheduling smaller group session zoom calls, providing very explicit and precise instructions and due-dates when given tasks, or providing a variety of supportive software tools.\nThe most important thing that managers can do is facilitate an environment in which all team members feel\npsychologically safe\nenough to make requests for\nwhat they need\nin order to do their job.\nFamily and friends first, work second\nLong-lasting relationships\nare the rocks of life\n, and come before work. As someone said in our\n#thanks channel\nafter helping a family member for five days after a hurricane: ‚ÄúTHANK YOU to GitLab for providing a culture where ‚Äúfamily first‚Äù is truly meant‚Äù.  Use the hashtag:\n#FamilyAndFriends1st\nEquity not just equality\nEquity vs. Equality: What‚Äôs the Difference?\nWhile the terms equity and equality may sound similar, the implementation of one versus the other can lead to dramatically different outcomes for marginalized people.\nEquality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging Competency\nCompetencies\nare the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.\nWe demonstrate diversity, inclusion and belongings when we foster an environment where everyone can thrive and ensuring that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute.\nIf you would like to improve your skills or expand your knowledge on topics relating to Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging at GitLab, check out our resources:\nBeing an Ally\nBeing Inclusive\nRecognizing Bias\nGitLab Job Grade\nDemonstrates Diversity & Inclusion Competency by‚Ä¶\nDemonstrates DIB Behaviors by‚Ä¶\n(Should not be considered an exhaustive list)\nKnowledge Assessment\n4\nLearns to understand the impact of biases.

Feedback can be from internal users (dogfooding), a limited number of external users (through our\nearly access program\n), or through feedback from our broader user community. We validate each iteration and adjust, but not at the expense of the user experience that we deliver to our customers.\nWhen we iterate at GitLab, we break up the work that we know we need to do into smaller chunks to iterate toward a targeted end state:\nMerge in codebase\nDogfood\nHave some external users (early access program)\nEnsure global optimization (use standardized systems)\nPlan beyond the iteration\nIteration does not require us to ship features that are open to all users from day one. Feedback can come from internal users or a limited number of external users (early access program). Moving through the\nrelease process is not iteration\nthough. Iteration is also not a\nreplacement for having a plan\n. We expect you to know where you are going, but you can iterate to get there.\nAn iteration might be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). If you make suggestions that can be excluded from the first iteration, turn them into a separate issue that you link.\nWhile you should have a clear vision of the desired outcome and how it addresses a customer pain point or improves the user experience, be efficient in your planning. Unless you identify important cross-functional interdependencies, focus detailed planning on the first step. It might feel you are moving too slowly; however, planning is critical in order to ensure you can move fast when implementing. You‚Äôre doing it right if you feel that you have shipped the minimal feature set in the first iteration. This value is the one people most underestimate when they join GitLab. The impact, both on your work process and on how much you achieve, is greater than anticipated. Frequently, the simplest version that provides value turns out to be the best one.\nMany people who join GitLab say they already practice iteration. But this is the value that is the hardest to understand and adopt. People are trained that if you don‚Äôt deliver a perfect or polished thing, there will be a problem. If you do just one piece of something, you have to come back to it. Doing the whole thing seems more efficient, even though it isn‚Äôt. If the complete picture is not clear, your work might not be perceived as you want it to be perceived. It seems better to make a comprehensive product. They see other GitLab team members being really effective with iteration but don‚Äôt know how to make the transition, and it‚Äôs hard to shake the fear that constant iteration can lead to shipping lower-quality work or a worse product. In reality, it is possible to ship a minimally valuable product while continuing to adhere to the documented quality standards.\nThe way to resolve this is to write down only what value you can add with the time you have for this project right now. That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours. Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation. Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful. If you‚Äôre doing iteration correctly, it should be. Reverting work back to a previous state is positive, not negative. We‚Äôre quickly getting feedback and learning from it. Making a small change prevented a bigger revert and made it easier to revert.\nHowever, if we take smaller steps and ship smaller, simpler features, we get feedback sooner. Instead of spending time working on the wrong feature or going in the wrong direction, we can ship the smallest product, receive fast feedback, and course correct. People might ask why something was not perfect. In that case, mention that it was an iteration, you spent only ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of time on it, and that the next iteration will contain ‚Äúy‚Äù and be ready on ‚Äúz‚Äù.\nIteration enables\nresults\nand\nefficiency\n.\nIn the\nGitLab Unfiltered video\nembedded above, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij shares key operating principles to reinforce iteration in an organization.\nStart with a long-term vision\nIteration involves driving results in pursuit of a long-term vision. While the intermediate goals may change as we iterate, we are unlikely to be successful if we don‚Äôt start with a vision of what we are working toward. Shipping that vision in iterations allows us to learn from customers using it and adjust the vision if needed. Iteration for the sake of iteration can lead to inefficiencies and not deliver desired results.\nIteration is no substitute for planning\nIteration without a plan can lead to inefficiencies and a subpar customer experience. Before iterating we need to plan. A plan should include:\nTime-bound objective: Where we want to be in a year\nUX: User experience we are working toward\nQuality: What quality is sufficient quality, inclusive of security\nSuccess metric: Usage we want at a specific time\nData schema: The data schema we need to measure progress towards project goals\nGTM plan: How we want to go to market\nEnablement: When we‚Äôd plan to train and enable the support and field teams\nMarketing: When we‚Äôd launch marketing (doesn‚Äôt have to be at release)\nSecure by design: default to the most secure configuration\nThe release process is not iteration\nMoving through the release process is not iteration.\nThe release process can include:\nDogfooding\nEarly access\nIncremental release using\na feature flag\nDevelopment stage progression\n(such as experiment to beta)\nRelease\nAnnouncement\nWhile\ndevelopment stages\ncan be used to indicate release progress, is not itself iteration.\nIterate toward global maximum\nIf we are not aware of interdependencies beyond our team, and we are not collaborating with others across the organization, we risk deliverables that settle into a ‚Äúlocal maximum‚Äù of quality, richness, and efficiency. This localization is largely defined by team structure and organizational boundaries. While an iteration can take place within a single team, that team is responsible for identifying inter-dependencies and proactively communicating and aligning with other teams working on related projects. This helps ensure that iterations are not ‚Äúhalf-baked‚Äù and align with work being done across the entire organization.\nDon‚Äôt wait\nDon‚Äôt wait on the small things. When you have something of value like a potential blog post or a small fix, implement it straight away. Right now, everything is fresh in your head and you have the motivation. Inspiration is perishable. Don‚Äôt wait until you have a better version. Don‚Äôt wait until you record a better video. Don‚Äôt wait for an event (like\nGitLab Summit\n). Inventory that isn‚Äôt released is a liability since it has to be managed, becomes outdated, and you miss out on the feedback you would have received had you implemented it straight away. When we don‚Äôt wait we signal intent to others that we have a purpose to resolve something.\nNote\n: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait‚Äù should not be used as a justification for not iterating toward the global maximum or at expense of the plan. If there are interdependencies to be considered or the iteration is customer facing, slow down and ensure that we are considering what is best for GitLab and our customers.\nSet a due date\nWe always try to set a due date. If needed, we cut scope.\nIf we have something planned for a specific date, we make that date. For example we\nshipped over 133 monthly releases\n. But every one of them doesn‚Äôt contain all the features we planned.\nIf we planned an announcement for a certain date, we might announce less or indicate what is still uncertain.\nBut we set a due date because having something out there builds trust and gives us better feedback.\nCleanup over sign-off\nAs discussed in\nSid‚Äôs interview on iteration\n, waiting for approval can slow things down. We can prevent this with automation (such as tests of database migration performance) or clean-up after the fact (refactor a Pajamas if something was added that isn‚Äôt coherent), but we try to ensure that people don‚Äôt need to wait for sign-off. As iteration does not require us to ship to all users on day one, we can clean up after an internal or beta release to mitigate the negative impact to all customers.\nStart off by impacting the fewest users possible\nIteration does not mean being open to all users from day one. If you do a gradual rollout of your change, prefer:\nFew users over many users\nInternal users (dogfooding) over external users\nEnvironments with fast feedback (SaaS) over slow feedback (self-managed)\nReduce cycle time\nShort iterations reduce\nour cycle time\n. Merging frequently also prevents merge conflicts.\nWork as part of the community\nSmall iterations make it easier to work with the wider community. Their work looks more like our work, and our work is also quicker to receive feedback.\nMinimal Valuable Change (MVC)\nWe encourage MVCs to be as small as possible. Always look to make the quickest change possible to improve the user‚Äôs outcome. If you validate that the change adds more value than what is there now, then do it. This may be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). No need to wait for something more robust. More information is in the\nproduct handbook\n, but this applies to everything we do in all functions. Specifically for product MVCs, there is additional responsibility to validate with customers that we‚Äôre adding useful functionality without obvious bugs or usability issues.\nMake a proposal\nIf you need to decide something as a team, make a concrete proposal instead of calling a meeting to get everyone‚Äôs input. Having a proposal will be a much more effective use of everyone‚Äôs time. Every meeting should be a review of a proposal. We should be\nbrainwriting on our own instead of brainstorming out loud\n. State the underlying problem so that people have enough context to propose reasonable alternatives. The people that receive the proposal should not feel left out and the person making it should not feel bad if a completely different proposal is implemented. Don‚Äôt let your desire to be involved early or to see your solution implemented stand in the way of getting to the best outcome. If you don‚Äôt have a proposal, don‚Äôt let that stop you from highlighting a problem, but please state that you couldn‚Äôt think of a good solution and list any solutions you considered.\nBy making a proposal you also provide better visibility into the work and the context surrounding it.\nIn this\nGitLab Unfiltered video\n, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij converses about iteration in engineering, leveraging proposals to break work into smaller components.\nEverything is in draft\nAt GitLab, we rarely mark any content or proposals as drafts. Everything is always in draft and subject to change. When everything is in draft, contributions from team members as well as the wider community are welcomed. By having everything in draft and\nassuming others have low context\n, confusion can be reduced as people have shared access to information.\nUnder construction\nAs we continue to expand the number of users we have, they will continue to expect stability and reliability. We must optimize for the long term without sacrificing stability along the way. This means that users may be inconvenienced in the short term, but current and future users will enjoy a better product in the end.\nEducating users on the longer-term plan helps create a shared understanding of how a small change will incrementally grow into something more. For example, we could share how a dropdown will evolve into a much more nuanced solution in the future. We can take the following steps to articulate our plan:\nOpen a feedback issue that provides context about the initial MVC (\nexample\n)\nEnsure the direction page articulates a long-term plan (\nexample\n)\nAnnounce the MVC in a release post, link to the feedback issue, and link to the direction page (\nexample\n)\nLow level of shame when dogfooding\nIn many organizations, you take a risk when you put forth any work that‚Äôs not perfect, work where you haven‚Äôt spent endless cycles planning for contingencies or counterpoints. Because of this, you‚Äôre incentivized to invest a lot of time and effort into preparing for ‚ÄòWhat if?‚Äô scenarios before any work is presented, even if the release is not customer facing and there is a low level of risk in imperfection.\nThe downside to that is clear when we are dogfooding: If you do eventually put forth the work, but it needed to be course-corrected a long time ago, you‚Äôve squandered time that you could have spent improving it through iteration.\nHaving a low level of shame when dogfooding or working internally requires you to combat a natural inclination to conceal work until it‚Äôs perfect, and instead celebrate the small changes.\nCultural lens\nCultural differences can bring unique challenges and expectations to iteration. For some, expressions like ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect‚Ä¶‚Äù can challenge cultural norms. We encourage you to bring your authentic self and seek shared understanding when iterating.\nGiving feedback\nand ensuring\npsychological safety\nare necessary for every iterative attempt.\nFocus on improvement\nWe believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not only on what is working well.\nIn every conversation, inside and outside the company, we should ask a question: What do you think we can improve?\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt recognize our successes; for example, see our\nSay Thanks\nvalue.\nWe are positive about the future of the company. We are\nhort\nTe\nrm\nritical\nnd\nong\nerm\nptimistic (\nSTeCALTO\n, for short).\nBe deliberate about scale\nFirst, optimize for speed and results (and be deliberate about how your change affects other processes/functionality); when it is a success, figure out how to scale it. Great examples are in\nthis article by Paul Graham\n.\nResist bundling\nResist the urge to bundle a series of smaller iterations so team members don‚Äôt see a project as their last (or best) opportunity to contribute. It‚Äôs tempting to\ncreate encompassing projects or initiatives\nthat roll many smaller projects up. This incarnation of scope creep drives up cost, encourages fewer risks, and incentivizes perfection (via longer cycle times) over progress. When we resist bundling, we reduce the risk that work will be canceled due to scale or scope. By resisting bundling we also reduce the coordination needed because fewer people or teams may be involved.\nMake two-way door decisions\nMost decisions are easy to reverse. In these cases, the\nDirectly Responsible Individual\nshould go ahead and make them without approval. Only when you can‚Äôt reverse them should there be a more thorough discussion. By\nembracing iteration\nand making two-way door decisions, we are more efficient and achieve more results.\nChanging proposals isn‚Äôt iteration\nChanging something without shipping it is a revision, not iteration. Only when the change is rolled out to users, whether\ninternal users or a limited customer group\n, can you learn from feedback. When you‚Äôre changing a proposal based on different opinions, you‚Äôre frequently wasting time; it would be better to roll out a small change quickly and get real world feedback. Never call a revision an iteration because it is almost the opposite.\nEmbracing Iteration\nIn order to embrace iteration, we should have the attitude that we are trying to achieve as much as possible in a small amount of time; it‚Äôs where we land at the end state of an iteration that counts. The benefit of iteration is to get fast feedback from users. Focus on sharing context at the\nend of the first iteration\nrather than a\nhypothetical future state\nthat requires multiple iterations. By embracing iteration we can increase creativity in incremental components.\nMake small merge requests\nWhen you are submitting a merge request for a code change, or a process change in\nthe handbook, keep it as small as possible. If you are adding a new page to the\nhandbook, create the new page with a small amount of initial content, get it merged\nquickly via\nHandbook Usage guidelines\n, and then add additional sections iteratively with subsequent merge requests.\nSimilarly, when adding features to GitLab, consider ways to\nreduce the scope\nof the feature before creating the merge request to ensure your merge request is as small as possible.\nAlways iterate deliberately\nRapid iteration can get in the way of\nresults\nif it‚Äôs not thought out; for example, when adjusting our marketing messaging (where consistency is key), product categories (where we‚Äôve set development plans),\norganizational structure\nor\nproduct scope alignment\n(where real human stresses and team stability are involved), sales methodologies (where we‚Äôve trained our teams) and this values page (where\nwe use the values to guide all GitLab team members). In those instances, we add additional review to the approval\nprocess; not to prohibit, but to be more deliberate in our iteration. The change process is documented in the\nGitLab Handbook Usage\npage and takes place via merge request approvals.\n12 things that are not iteration\nIteration is often counterintuitive and difficult to do. To clarify what an iteration is, it helps to see examples of what is not an iteration. Below are 12 examples of things we‚Äôve seen mistaken as iteration, but don‚Äôt meet our definition of iteration.\nReducing quality, or lowering goal posts\nAvoiding or reducing documentation\nCompromising on security\nDelivering something that‚Äôs not the recommended path or on by default\nShipping something of no value\nAn excuse to focus on unimportant items\nMoving through the release process\nRevisions you don‚Äôt ship or publish\nAn excuse to impose unrealistically tight timelines\nAn excuse to avoid planning\nImposing long hours\nExpecting others to fix your work\nIn this\nGitLab Unfiltered video\n, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij elaborates on each of these 12 things that are not iteration.\nIteration Competency\nCompetencies\nare the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.\nWe demonstrate iteration when we do the smallest viable and valuable thing, get it out quickly for feedback, and make changes based that feedback.\nGitLab Job Grade\nDemonstrates Iteration Competency by‚Ä¶\nKnowledge Assessment\n5\nDevelops own knowledge by trying and failing. When asking questions isn't content with silence or unhelpful/incomplete responses, seeks out primary sources.\nKnowledge Assessment for Individual Contributors\n6\nActively looks for opportunities to iterate and contribute to boring solutions. Balances short term gains and long term benefit with team's help. Ships things that aren't 100% knowing that you'll be able to improve them in the next revision. Asks questions with abandon.

Identifies and prevents decisions that are not \"two-way door decisions\". Ships. All the time. Sounds like a broken record in discussions with more junior members of the team; always asking if we can make something smaller.\nKnowledge Assessment for People Leaders\n9\nIn addition to upholding the requirements of a Staff/Manager level, a Principal/Sr. Manager practices and fosters the value of iteration to team members. They hold their team members accountable for iteration and boring solutions.\n10\nIn addition to upholding the requirements of a Principal/Sr. Manager, a Distinguished/Director proactively finds ways to drive the value of iteration and boring solutions.\n11\nIn addition to upholding the requirements of a  Distinguished/Director , a Sr. Distinguished/Sr. Director embeds the value of Iteration across the department and division.  They use their cognitive and analytical abilities to anticipate and adapt to unpredictabilities in regard to strategic risk in a way that benefits all involved.\n12\nIn addition to upholding the requirements of a Sr. Distinguished/Sr. Director , a Fellow/VP leads the way for the value of Iteration across the division and cross functional teams. They confidently lead their teams through change and proactively take risks based on values and the strategic vision.\nIn addition to upholding the requirements of a Fellow/VP,  the EVP champions the value of Iteration across GitLab. They are comfortable leading through discomfort and the unease associated with change and innovation.\nüëÅÔ∏è Transparency\nBe open about as many things as possible. By making information public, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. Use public issue trackers, projects, and repositories when possible. Transparency is not communication. Just because something exists in the handbook or elsewhere doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be communicated again or in a more robust fashion to the people who need to understand or acknowledge it. On a personal level, be direct when sharing information, and admit when you‚Äôve made a mistake or were wrong. When something goes wrong, it is a great opportunity to say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the\nkaizen\nmoment here?‚Äù and find a better way without hurt feelings.\nEven as a\npublic company\n, we know that our value of transparency will be key to our success. This value can be hard to follow at times. You might ask yourself: what should be shared, how much to share, whether or not to speak up but definitely take the time to always opt for maximum transparency by adhering to the operating principles below. Often, company values get diluted as they grow, most likely because they do not write anything down. But we will make sure our values scale with the company. As a\npublic company\n, we declare everyone in the company as an insider, which allows us to remain transparent internally about our numbers, etc. Everything else that can be transparent will continue to be so.\nWhen there are exceptions, material that is\nnot public by default is documented\n.\nPublic by default\nEverything at GitLab is public by default.\nThe public process does two things: allows others to benefit from the conversation and acts as a filter. Since there is only a limited amount of time, we prioritize conversations that a wider audience can benefit from.\nOne example of transparency at GitLab is the\npublic repository of this website\nthat also contains this\ncompany handbook\n. Others include the\nGitLab CE\nand\nGitLab EE\nissue trackers, as well as\nmarketing\nand\ninfrastructure\n. Transparency creates awareness for GitLab, allows us to recruit people that care about our values, gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the company, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great software, documentation, examples, lessons,\nand processes with the\nwhole community\nand the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures.\nIn line with our value of transparency and being public by default, all GitLab team member\nprofiles\nshould be public. Public profiles also enable broader collaboration and efficiencies between teams. To do so, please make sure that the checkbox under the\nPrivate profile\noption is unchecked\nin your profile settings\n. If you do not feel comfortable with your full name or location on your profile, please change it to what feels appropriate to you as these are displayed even on private profiles.\nBecause we are public by default and have the\nSAFE framework\nwe don‚Äôt need to make cases for why things should be transparent. If something is unSAFE and needs to remain\nnot public\nit can be.\nNot public\nWe make information public by default because\ntransparency is one of our values\n.\nHowever it is\nmost important to focus on results\n.\nTherefore, a category of information is\npublic\nunless there is a reason for it not to be. If something is not public, there should be a reference in the handbook that states a confidential decision was taken with a link to our Not Public guidelines, unless GitLab Legal and Corporate Affairs believes it carries undue risk. We document what is\nnot public by default\non our communication page.\nIf you believe something shouldn‚Äôt be public that currently is (or vice versa), then\nmake a merge request\nto the relevant page(s) suggesting the change so that you can collaborate with others and discuss with the\n. When content contains information which is\nnot public\nit is recommended to remove the specific sections which are not public, put them on their own page in the internal handbook, and then link out to that with a ‚Äúnot public/internal only‚Äù note. Always share publicly what we can.\nWhen information is not public, it may also be treated as limited access, only shared with certain GitLab roles, teams, or team members due to privacy considerations, contractual obligation, or other reasons that the author or DRI can specify.\nCertain kinds of information default to limited access, including details about team members or customers who did not give permission to share the information.\nMost companies become non-transparent over time because they don‚Äôt accept any\nmistakes. Instead, we should always err on the side of transparency when there\nis a choice to be made between caution or inaction, and transparency. If we make\na mistake, we now know what the limits of transparency are for the company and\nwe should\ndocument this\n.\nThe only exception to this rule would be in the case when there are legal concerns.\nBecause some information is\nnot public\nthe public information can be lacking some context. We should be cognizant of that.\nDirectness\nBeing direct is about being transparent with each other. We try to channel our inner\nBen Horowitz\nby being\nboth straightforward and kind\n.\nFeedback is always about your work and not your person. That doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy to give or receive it.\nArticulate when you change your mind\nIf you state one thing, and then change course and support a different direction, point, or outcome, articulate this. It is OK to have your position changed by new data. Articulating that an\nearlier\nstance is not your\ncurrent\nstance provides clarity to others and encourages data-driven decision making.\nSurface issues constructively\nBe transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable). If you make a mistake, don‚Äôt worry; correct it and\nproactively\nlet the affected party, your team, and the CEO know what happened, how you corrected it, and how‚Äîif needed‚Äîyou changed the process to prevent future mistakes.\nTransparency is most valuable if you continue to do it when there are costs\nWe practice transparency even when hiding the facts would be easier. For example, many companies do not give you the real reason why they declined your application because it increases the chance of legal action. We want to only reject people for the right reasons and we want to give them the opportunity to grow by getting this feedback. Therefore, we‚Äôll accept the increased risk of holding ourselves to a high standard of making decisions and do the right thing by telling them what we thought. Other examples are being transparent about\nsecurity incidents\nand participating in and contributing to Live Broadcasts.\nTransparency has costs (distraction, mis-interpretation, etc.) but also great benefits (productivity, hiring, retention, brand awareness, etc). We should carefully weigh the tradeoff between costs and benefits, to prevent a knee-jerk reaction to reduce transparency when it has costs.\nSingle Source of Truth\nBy having most company communications and work artifacts be public to the Internet, we have one single source of truth for all GitLab team members, users, customers, and other community members. We don‚Äôt need separate artifacts with different permissions for different people.\nFindability\nOur transparency value means more than just making information accessible to all. In order to\nimprove performance\nit‚Äôs important that we not only ensure information is accessible, but also ensure it flows to the correct places and is\nfindable\nby those who need it. Focusing on information flow will ensure you, for example, utilize\nmulti-modal communication\n, or that you keep your\nstakeholders informed of changes\nby posting links to MRs in Slack.\nSay why, not just what\nTransparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient.\nThis also helps with institutional memory: a year from now when you want to know why a decision was made, or not, the issue or MR that has the decision also shares why the decision was made.\nThis is related to\nChesterton‚Äôs fence\n- it‚Äôs much easier to suggest removing or changing something if you know why it exists in the first place.\nIf you use generalized terms such as ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù or ‚Äúbest practices,‚Äù be sure to give context, as without context they can be seen as potentially vague or opaque.\nSimilarly, merely stating a single value isn‚Äôt a great explanation for why we are making a particular decision. Many things could be considered ‚Äúiteration‚Äù or ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù that don‚Äôt match our definition of those values. Try to link to an operating principle of the value or provide more context, instead of just saying a single value‚Äôs name.\nSaying why and not just what enables discussion around topics that may impact more than one value; for instance, when weighing the\nefficiency of boring solutions\nwith the focus on\ncustomer results\n. When decisions align with all of our values, they are easy to discuss and decide. When there are multiple values involved, using our\nvalues hierarchy\nand\ndirectly\ndiscussing the tradeoffs is easier with more context.\nArticulating why also helps people understand how something changed when you\narticulate that you changed your mind\n.\nSaying why does not mean justifying a decision against all other suggestions.\nThe\nis responsible for their decision.\nThe DRI is not responsible for convincing other people, but they should be able to articulate their reasoning for the change.\nWhen a GitLab Team Member comes across an ask or material (MR, handbook, etc.) that does not provide a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù with sufficient context, the Team Member is responsible for getting the why and, if needed, working with the DRI to ensure that it is adequately documented and communicated to give context to other team members.  In the absence of a why, team members may speculate the why. This is something that can lead to disruption and inefficiency.\nReproducibility\nEnable everybody involved to come to the same conclusion as you. This not only involves\nreasoning\n, but also providing, for example: raw data and not just plots; scripts to automate tasks and not just the work they have done; and documenting steps while analyzing a problem. Do your best to make the line of thinking transparent to others, even\nif they may disagree\n.\nTransparency Competency\nCompetencies\nare the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.\nWe demonstrate transparency when we are open with as many things as possible reducing the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier.\nGitLab Job Grade\nDemonstrates Transparency Competency by‚Ä¶\nKnowledge Assessment\n5\nUses public issue trackers, projects, and repositories when possible. Looks for opportunities to publicly share the things that they are working on.\nKnowledge Assessment for Individual Contributors\n6\nProvides context and background on projects and issues so that those with no prior knowledge are able to contribute to the discussion. They welcome feedback and new ideas as they know that will lead to a better solution.\n7\nContinually surfaces improvements across their functional area of expertise. They share feedback with others and understand how to disagree and commit to solutions. They model what it means to be as open as possible. They encourage conversation in public channels.\n8\nImplements open processes across their team. They also track team issues and projects openly so their team members are aware of everything that is happening on a team at a given time. They leverage feedback to drive the best possible outcomes with the information they have available. They also share feedback with their team and their peers in a timely, kind manner so their position on a given topic is known.\nKnowledge Assessment for People Leaders\n9\nFosters and coaches openness across cross functional departments. They lead cross functional issues, projects and ideas inviting feedback to generate the best possible solution. They hold their teams accountable to continue to find opportunities to share things openly. They give feedback to their team members, peers and managers in a timely, kind manner so their position on a topic is known.\n10\nDrives their departmental strategy with openness as a key value. They hold their management team accountable to working openly and pushes them to make everything transparent even when it might be difficult to do so. They coach managers on the value that additional feedback can bring to the end solution.\n11\nDevelops leaders that work openly and continue to provide timely, kind feedback across their division. They develop leaders that drive their teams with openness as a foundational part of the way that they operate.\n12\nLeads the company by being open in all things. They are open with things that might traditionally not be shared broadly. They communicate directly and provide feedback in a timely manner to initiatives happening within their department and across the company. They hold the e group and other leaders accountable for upholding this value.\nChampions transparency both internally, across the company and externally. They participate both internally and externally in events and share the value that being open can provide to increasing trust with team members and others that interact with our product. They provide timely, kind feedback with initiatives happening internally and externally. They hold the e group and other leaders accountable for upholding this value.\nWhy have values\nOur values provide guidelines on how to behave and are written to be actionable.\nThey help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from GitLab team members.\nThey help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others.\nValues provide a framework for distributed decision making, detailed in GitLab‚Äôs\nTeamOps\nmanagement philosophy. They allow individuals to determine what to do without asking their manager and they allow teams to make consistent decisions. When teams across the organization reference the same values in their decision making, there is consistency in how decisions are made. This ensures that\nour culture\nremains driven by our values.\nLastly, values create a\nconscious culture\nthat is designed to help you prosper and experience exceptional personal growth through work.\nFive dysfunctions\nOur values also help us to prevent the\nfive dysfunctions\n:\nFear of conflict\nSeeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate =>\nprevented by transparency, specifically\ndirectness\nand collaboration, specifically\nshort toes\nAbsence of trust\nUnwilling to be vulnerable within the group =>\nprevented by collaboration, specifically\nkindness\nAvoidance of accountability\nDucking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards =>\nprevented by results, iteration, and\ntransparency\nInattention to results\nFocusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success =>\nprevented by\nresults\nLack of commitment\nFeigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization =>\nprevented by transparency, specifically\ndirectness\nSome dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values; for example, trust is not one of our values.\nSimilar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly.\nWe hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given.\nOperating principles\nOperating principles are behaviors that empower GitLab team members to definitively live out a given value.\nThey clarify what a given core value means and looks like\nat GitLab\n.\nUnderstanding this distinction is critical to thriving at GitLab,\nparticularly for\nnewer team members\nwho may be familiar with a prior organization‚Äôs interpretation of iteration or collaboration (as examples).\nProcess for removing operating principles\nValues are not just things we do, but things that actively drive good behavior.  When we remove them it doesn‚Äôt mean we stopped believing in it, just that it wasn‚Äôt actively helping to drive behavior. If we don‚Äôt prune our operating principles, then we will be like every other company: things that make sense but are not leading to a better culture.\nTo\nremove\nan operating principle from the Handbook page, submit your change through a merge request and explain your reasons in the merge request description.\nThe GitLab Value Handbook Page owner must approve and merge the request.\nMention the specific value\nMost companies have a list of values. In companies without strong values, folks often use generalizations when they refer to values. For example, ‚Äúnot a value add‚Äù or ‚Äúscored well on values during our interview.‚Äù In companies with strong values, folks name the specific, relevant value as it applies to a given topic or situation. Values are only powerful when they are individually understood and applied by team members.\nFor certain business decisions or projects (such as\ncompensation\nand\nend-point management\n), GitLab team members may have a lot of opinions and interest,\nand they want to provide their feedback and comments.\nOn the other hand,  it might be challenging for the project DRI to digest and respond to all these inputs.\nWhat should you do in this scenario?\nEveryone can contribute at GitLab.\nWe encourage team members to share feedback and leave comments on issues.\nLeaving feedback and comments shows that team members care about a topic and about GitLab as a company.\nThese perspectives may also uncover potential risks and problems in the project.\nThere shouldn‚Äôt be a\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they have their job to do?‚Äù\ntype of response.\nFurthermore, we shouldn‚Äôt judge team members who are perceived as being the ‚Äúsqueaky wheel.‚Äù\nAt GitLab, we\nmeasure impact, not activity\n.\nAs long as a team member is producing required results, they are empowered to decide how to spend their time.\nOn the other hand, as GitLab grows in size, we need to make decisions and the decisions may not be agreed to by everyone.\nIf a decision or project is sensitive or controversial, and receives large amounts of feedback, it can be challenging for the project DRI to handle.\nIn these cases, it‚Äôs best to have time-boxed feedback built into timelines.\nIn a hypothetical example where a DRI needs to decide between red and gold potatoes for a stew, they would create an issue with the following sentiment:\nWe‚Äôre deciding between red potatoes and gold potatoes to go into the stew. We have to decide by Tuesday 2020-07-14 so that we can get our order to the grocery store on Wednesday 2020-07-15. We‚Äôll be collecting input and feedback until that point. Jane is the DRI and will make the decision on 2020-07-14 with all the information we have at that point. Here is the framework we‚Äôre using for the decision:\nare there allergies to consider?\ncost per pound\nteam member preferences\nOnce the decision is made, it will be what is going into the stew.\nThis method\nhas shown itself to be effective\nat soliciting productive feedback that doesn‚Äôt derail a timeline while ensuring team members feel heard.\nWhy our values are public\nCompanies are encouraged to copy and implement GitLab‚Äôs values. They are Creative Commons and can be copied verbatim.\nWe make our values public for\nmany reasons\n. There is great power and efficiency in teams who share company values. Concealing values until\nafter\nsomeone is hired into an organization is not a wise strategy.\nNot everyone will see our values and feel aligned with them, and that‚Äôs OK. By making values public, it shows respect for the time of job seekers who conduct due diligence on prospective employers. When people who\nare\naligned with GitLab‚Äôs values apply for an\nopen vacancy\n, this allows our hiring teams to more efficiently move candidates through the\ninterview process\n.\nIn a\nGitLab Unfiltered interview on values\n, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.\nCompanies may ask you to write a blank check. They‚Äôll say, ‚ÄòCome join our organization, and when you‚Äôre here, you need to subscribe to our values, our way of working, and our strategy. It‚Äôs very essential, and it‚Äôs part of our identity!‚Äô\nBut these companies don‚Äôt give you the opportunity up front to evaluate it. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. If it‚Äôs so important that people share your values, have them out there.\nHierarchy\nOccasionally, values can contradict each other. It‚Äôs useful to keep in mind this hierarchy to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent with our core values.\nThink of the hierarchy as a weighting system. Values higher in the hierarchy do not automatically override values lower in the hierarchy. Here are some examples:\nIf a change impacts Transparency positively but impacts Efficiency negatively in roughly the same amount, we would move ahead since Transparency is higher in the hierarchy than Efficiency.\nIf a change has a massive positive impact on Diversity but negatively impacts Iteration, we would move ahead even though Diversity is lower in the hierarchy than Iteration because the overall impact is more positive than negative.\nIn a\nGitLab Unfiltered interview on values\n, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.\nIt‚Äôs an attempt to relieve at least some of the tension. It‚Äôs not absolute. If you think of values as binary, that‚Äôs not going to work. There will always be interpretation, and there‚Äôs always magnitude to consider.\nWe made a hierarchy so that it‚Äôs clear, in the end, the result matters most. For instance, we‚Äôre not going to be transparent for the sake of being transparent. We‚Äôre not radical in our transparency. We do it because we think it will lead to better outcomes.\nThose hierarchies are really important. They won‚Äôt preempt every debate, but it helps.\nUpdating our values\nOur values are updated frequently and as needed. Everyone is welcome to make a suggestion to improve them. To update: make a merge request and assign it to the CEO. If you‚Äôre a\nteam member\nor in the\ncore team\nplease post a link to the MR in the\n#values\nSlack channel\n. If you‚Äôre not part of those groups, please send a direct X/Twitter message to\n@sytses\n.\nHow do we reinforce our values\nWhatever behavior you reward will become your values. We reinforce our values by:\nCriteria we use for\npromotions\nand communicate to the whole company on announcement.\nWhat we select for during\nhiring\n.\nWhat we emphasize during\non-boarding\n.\nCriteria we use for our\nannual compensation review\n.\nWhat we refer to when\nmaking decisions\n.\nThe example the E-group sets for the company since\na fish rots from the head down\n.\nWhat we expect from all team members, as\nambassadors for our values\n.\nKeeping them\nup to date\nwith a\nstream of commits that add details\n.\nBehavior we give each other\n360 feedback\non.\nBehavior we\ncompliment\n.\nCriteria we use for\ndiscretionary bonuses\n.\nWhat we include in our\noffer letters\nCriteria we use to\nmanage underperformance\n.\nWhat we do when we\nlet people go\n.\nGiving value awards during\nGitLab Summit\n.\nProviding GitLab team members and\nqualified individuals\ntransparency into all aspects of the company through the\nCEO Shadow Program\nto enable them to better engage and collaborate cross-functionally.\nLinking the takeaways of courses to our values, like we did for\nthe Crucial Conversations training\n.\nThe default settings of the software we use (for example:\nSpeedy meetings\n,\ndocument sharing\n, agendas, etc.)\nReinforcing our values with features in GitLab, for example the\nIterations feature\n.\nApplying one of our\nvalues virtual backgrounds\nin video calls.\nOur GitLab\nSong Book\nRegularly conduct a values exercise at the\ne-group offsite\n.\nThe most important moments to reinforce our values are decisions which affect individual team members most: hiring, promotions, and bonuses, which is why every promotion document at GitLab is shared with the entire company and uses the values as its core structure.\nIn negative feedback, we should be specific about what the problem is. For example, saying someone is ‚Äú\nnot living the values\n‚Äù isn‚Äôt helpful.\nYour values are what you hire for, what you praise people for, and what you promote them for. By definition, what you do in those instances\nare\nyour values. It‚Äôs not what you say they are. Values should be explicitly part of our\nhiring\nprocess, our job profiles, and our\nreview process\n.\nWhen we give\nbonuses\nand\npromotions\n, they are always linked to values. That‚Äôs the crucial thing. If you reinforce them there, that‚Äôs the most powerful thing you can do. ‚Äî\nSid Sijbrandij, GitLab co-founder\nWhat to do if values aren‚Äôt being lived out\nValue erosion can occur when indifference and apathy are tolerated. It can also occur when individuals justify undesired behaviors by interpreting values as ‚Äúme values‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcompany values.‚Äù For example, a team member may speak to the importance of personal efficiency in order to justify not collaborating professionally with peers. This is not what we expect from team members in terms of efficiency and collaboration.\nIf you feel that values are not being lived out in a given scenario, speak up and ask for context in a respectful manner. Navigating value conflicts starts with\nassuming positive intent\nfrom other team members. Offer links to relevant values and/or operating principles when discussing the issue. If there is confusion or disagreement about the interpretation of a value, please surface the discussion in GitLab‚Äôs\n#values\nSlack channel\n(for GitLab team members) or @-mentioning\n@gitlab\non X/Twitter (for those who do not work at GitLab).\nIn a\nGitLab Unfiltered interview on values\n, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.\nAlmost every time we face a hard decision at GitLab, it‚Äôs because values are in conflict. It‚Äôs not binary logic. It requires conversation, and sometimes there is no obvious answer. We can only achieve resolution by respectfully talking with each other and trusting the DRI to make the ultimate decision.\nPermission to play\nFrom our values we excluded some behaviors that are obvious; we call them our\npermission to play\nbehavior:\nBe truthful and honest.\nBe dependable and reliable.\nTry to keep promises. If you might not keep a promise, proactively communicate as soon as you suspect it.\nBe deserving of the trust of our team members, users and customers.\nBe committed to the success of the whole organization.\nAct in the best interest of the company, our team members, our customers, users, and investors.\nMake the best decisions for GitLab.\nAct in accordance with the law.\nDon‚Äôt show favoritism as\nit breeds resentment, destroys employee morale, and creates disincentives for good performance\n. Seek out ways to be fair to everyone.\nWe don‚Äôt want people to play politics at GitLab.\nAn example of politics is people discussing a proposal and being overly focused on whose proposal it is.\nThis is a manifestation of the\nBelief Bias\n, where we judge an argument‚Äôs strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how strongly\nwe\nsupport the conclusion.\nProposals should be weighed on their merits and not on who proposed them.\nAnother example is people being promoted based on others liking them or having a lot of alliances. We want people to be promoted based on their results. We value collaboration, but that‚Äôs different from being promoted just because people like you.\nBelow are some attributes of political and non-political work environments. GitLab plans to maintain a non-political one.\nPolitical environment\nNon-political environment\nValues are weaponized and used out of their intended context\nTeam members utilize values with a positive intent\nTeam members are driven by self-interest\nTeam members are driven by company interest\nTeam members work in silos\nTeam members optimize globally\nPeople have territorial behaviors and are quick to perceive suggestions as attacks\nPeople have\nshort toes\nPeople have unhealthy alliances with backroom conversations\nPeople have good intent and actively collaborate with folks\nInformation is intentionally withheld\nInformation is shared early (often WIP) and at the same time with all interested parties\nPeople try to undermine each other‚Äôs credibility by arguing with the weakest part of their argument\nPeople take a\n‚Äústeel man‚Äù position\nand argue against the strongest version of your opponent‚Äôs position\nFolks do not provide direct feedback. Instead, they withhold their thoughts or speak behind each other‚Äôs backs\nFeedback is given directly. This includes feedback about a manager‚Äôs team\nCommunicating your own suggestions through a report instead of directly\nFeedback is given directly from the person who has it\nEvaluating proposals or work by who said or did it instead of by what is in it\nProposals¬†and work is evaluated without regard to who worked on them\nLack of transparency in escalations. Team members go to a manager without first attempting to align with peers on an issue or letting peers know\nTeam members speak directly to each other about feedback and requests in order to resolve their own conflicts. When they escalate,\nthey do it in an effective way\nValues make choices\nValues make and clarify choices. A well-chosen value has a defensible opposite. Apple, for example, values secrecy over transparency and product perfection over iteration. They are successful building around our counter values ‚Äî although the result is a very different company.\nWhat is not a value\nAll-remote\nisn‚Äôt a value. It is something we do because it helps to\npractice our values\nof transparency, efficiency, results, and diversity, inclusion & belonging.\nQuestions from new team members\nDuring every\nGitLab 101 session with new hires\nwe discuss our values. We document the questions and answers to\nFrequently Asked Questions about the GitLab Culture\n.\nNew team members should read\nGitLab‚Äôs guide to starting a new remote role\n, and reference\ninterviews\ncentered on values within the\nGitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel\n.\nMission\nOur\nmission\nis to\nenable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world\n.

We comprise four areas to support designing and building the GitLab product.\nUX Research\nTechnical Writing\nProduct Design\nFoundations -\nPajamas\nOur goal is to make our product easy to use, supportive of contributions from the wider GitLab community, and built for a diverse global community. We want GitLab to be the easiest and most delightful product in its class.\nHow we work\nWe support all users from beginners to experts.\nWe believe that GitLab software should be unintimidating and accessible for a beginner, without oversimplifying important features for advanced users. We stay with users every step of the way to help them learn fast as a beginner and then become an expert over time.\nWe‚Äôre building one product, together.\nWe‚Äôre highly focused on ensuring that no matter how big our product gets, the entire experience stays cohesive, consistent, and interconnected.\nWe‚Äôre humble facilitators of user experience design.\nEveryone is a designer;\neveryone can contribute\n. We are not egotistical, moody experts who alone hold the keys to user delight. We encourage Product Managers, Engineers, and the wider GitLab community to contribute to creating an exceptional user experience.\nWe look for small changes and big impacts.\nSometimes the simplest, most boring solution is what is needed to make users successful. We want our UI to stay out of the user‚Äôs way. We work iteratively to make modest but valuable changes that make users more productive, faster, and better at accomplishing their tasks.\nWe‚Äôre informed by empathy.\nWe‚Äôre human, and we design for humans, so we strive for understanding, self-awareness, and connection. We are quirky, and we introduce our quirks into designs when appropriate.\nWhen we find problems that are simple to fix, we are empowered to make those changes ourselves.\nIf a change will take you less than 15 minutes to make (for example, a minor change to our website or microcopy in the product), then start with an MR instead of an issue. By making the change yourself, you are taking immediate action to improve our product, and you might learn a new skill, too! If it seems simple, but you have questions, remember that there are people who can help you with code changes both in the UX department and across the company.\nWe work closely with the community, and our stable counterparts Product Managers (PM), Frontend engineers (FE), Backend engineers (BE), Quality engineers, and the Brand team. We follow GitLab‚Äôs shared process referred to as the\nProduct Development Flow\nand\nR&D Interlock\n.\nPMs define the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù to lead the product direction. These are the benefits we provide to users. It‚Äôs informed by gathering customer and user feedback in partnership with UX Research.\nProduct Designers define ‚Äúhow‚Äù the direction is experienced. It‚Äôs how users interact with the product to gain the benefits.\nEngineers define ‚Äúhow‚Äù the product is built to meet the product and experience direction from PM and Product Design.\nWorkflows\nUX Researcher\nTechnical Writing\nProduct Designer\nProduct Design Manager\nCross-functional Prioritization\nHeadcount planning\nEvery Product Designer is aligned with a PM and is responsible for the same customer benefits the PM oversees. Technical Writers each support multiple stage groups. UX Researchers support multiple groups within a section.\nIn the spirit of having stable counterparts, we plan headcount as follows:\nOne Product Designer for every stage group.\n1:1 ratio of Product Designers to PM (excludes stage groups with no user-facing impact or, in some cases, stage groups with low usage).\n1 Product Designer for 1-3 Frontend engineers; 2 Product Designers for 4-5 Frontend engineers.\nOne Technical Writer for up to three stage groups.\n1:3 ratio of Technical Writers to stage groups.\nApproximately a 1:21 ratio of Technical Writers to Engineers.\nOne UX Researcher for up to 5 stage groups.\n1:5 ratio of UX Researchers to Product Managers.\nApproximately a 1:35 ratio of UX Researchers to Engineers.\nManager support that‚Äôs appropriate for the function.\nApproximately a 1:5 ratio of Managers to direct reports for UX Research and Product Design.\nApproximately a 1:7 ratio of Managers to direct reports for Technical Writing.\nUX labels\nGitLab uses labels to categorize, prioritize, and track work. The following is a breakdown of the labels most directly related to the UX workflow. An overview of all the label types and uses can be found in the\ncontributing doc\n.\nlabel\n: Indicates that UX work is required on this issue. These issues can be new features, ideas for improvement or anything else where UX should contribute their expertise.\nInclusion\nlabel\n: A change to GitLab that promotes inclusion as it relates to our\ndiversity\nvalue.\nInclusive design\nlabel\n: Considering, exploring, and evaluating the different ways someone would access, interact with, or contribute to content that results in a more accessible experience.\nAccessibility and scoped accessibility labels\nare used to identify issues with accessibility impact. The scoped labels should be added after an accessibility audit has validated the impact and used in combination with\npriority\nand\nseverity\nlabels to\ntriage\nan issue.\nAccessibility\nlabel\n: Issues that contain actionable items that help create an accessible product experience.\nAccessibility-audit\nlabel\n: Issues related to auditing exisiting experiences in order to understand possible accessibility-related improvements.\nAccessibility-ops\nlabel\n: Issues related to building accessibility into our internal workflows.\naccessibility::critical\n: Prevents some or all users from performing critical tasks with no possible workaround.\naccessibility::high\n: Prevents some users from performing critical tasks. A workaround may exist, but not without creating frustration and inefficiency.\naccessibility::medium\n: Prevents some users from performing non-critical tasks, or where the user experience is seriously degraded for users with certain assistive technologies.\naccessibility::low\n: The user experience is degraded for users with certain disabilities or using certain assistive technologies, but users can still accomplish tasks.\nlearnability\nlabel\n: Issues that address learnability problems by helping users quickly become familiar with GitLab features.\nScoped workflow labels\nfrom the\nProduct Development Flow\nshould be used to indicate where an issue is in the development lifecycle. Issues can move between workflow labels as many times as necessary, and not all labels will be applicable to every issue. Issues that require UX would use one of these labels as defined in the Product Development Flow:\nworkflow::validation backlog\nworkflow::problem validation\nworkflow::design\nworkflow::solution validation\nPajamas component lifecycle labels\nare scoped labels used for creating and updating\nPajamas\ncomponents. Label usage guidelines can be found in the\nPajamas component lifecycle documentation\n.\nUX problem validation\nlabel\n: Indicates that the issue requires UX work to validate that the problem is relevant to users. We use this label in addition to the Product Development Flow scoped labels, so that we can track validation efforts over time in our\nUX Performance Indicators\n.\nUX solution validation\nlabel\n: Indicates that the issue requires tasks to validate that the proposed solution is technically feasible and meets user needs. We use this label in addition to the Product Development Flow scoped labels, so that we can track validation efforts over time in our\nUX Performance Indicators\n.\nUI polish\nlabel\n: Indicates the issue covers\nonly\nvisual improvement(s) to the existing user interface.\nDeferred UX\nlabel\n: Deferred UX results from the intentional decision to deviate from the UX vision or MVC, which sacrifices the user experience. Deferred UX labeled issues are to be included in subsequent releases. Use this label to indicate that the UX released does not meet:\nUX and Pajamas specifications\nUsability standards\nFeature viability standards\nThis label is applied to any follow-up issues that address a UX gap. It does not apply to the issue or merge request that created the Deferred UX. For example, if the agreed MVC design solution is not fully realized due to release pressures or implementation oversight, that‚Äôs considered Deferred UX.\nIf the design is implemented correctly but unforeseen UX issues are identified, it is\nnot\nconsidered Deferred UX.\nIf in doubt about when to apply this label, use the following rule: If you can say ‚ÄúThis UX problem did not originate from an issue or merge request,‚Äù then it‚Äôs just UX, not Deferred UX. In case your team makes the decision ship an MVC that contains Deferred UX, it is recommended to create an issue to track it as soon as the change has been released.\nLearn more about Deferred UX as a UX Department Performance Indicator\n.\nUX Paper Cuts\nlabel\n: Used to prioritize and track work from the UX Paper Cuts team.\nSeeking community contributions\nSystem Usability Scale (SUS)\nlabels\n: Indicates that the issue is related to usability problems surfaced in one of our SUS research efforts. More specifically, issues related to SUS that are prioritized can be labeled with the corresponding Fiscal Year and Quarter. For example:\nSUS::FY22 Q2 - Incomplete\n.\nLearn more about SUS score as a UX Department Performance Indicator\nRegression\nlabel\n: Indicates a bug introduced in the latest release that broke correct behavior (see the\ncontribution guidelines\nfor more info).\nUX scorecard\nlabel\n: Indicates the primary issue or epic for the\nUX Scorecard\n. We use this label to help us easily find current work and track efforts over time.\nUX scorecard-rec\nlabel\n: Indicates this issue is a recommendation that was a result of a UX scorecard review. It‚Äôs OK if the issue was created prior to the scorecard being done; it can still be pulled into the set of recommendations.\nCM scorecard\nlabel\n: Indicates the primary issue or epic for the\nCM Scorecard\n. It is used to easily find current work and track efforts.\ncm-scorecard-rec\nlabel\n: Indicates this issue is a recommendation that was a result of a CM Scorecard.\nActionable Insights\ndocument learnings from research that need to be acted on.\nActionable Insight::Exploration needed\n: A research insight derived from a UX research study that requires further exploration.\nActionable Insight::Product change\n: A research insight derived from a UX research study and requires a change to the product experience.\nType labels\n: Used to track feature, maintenance, and bug issues and MRs. UX Leadership are active participants in influencing the prioritization of all three work types. See also who are the\nDRIs for prioritization\n.\nTheme labels\ncan be created to group issues that solve a similar user experience problem but don‚Äôt have a category. This can be especially useful for a user experience that spans the product. These issues still require a UX label.\nUX: Feature Discovery Improvement\n: Indicates issue may improve feature discoverability.\nUX: Onboarding Improvement\n: Indicates issue is a potential onboarding improvement.\nUX Calendar\nThe\nUX Calendar\n(\ninternal only\n) is the SSOT for our team meetings. You can find the details for UX calls, UX Forum, and other team meetings here. These meetings are open to everyone in GitLab. Anyone in the UX department can add events to the Google Calendar. Managers and above can make changes and manage sharing, while ICs can make changes to events. Please reach out in the\n#ux_leadership\nSlack channel with any questions or requests.\nUX All Hands\nThe UX All Hands meeting takes place every six weeks, with two sessions to accommodate both EMEA/AMER and APAC/AMER-friendly time zones.\nThe purpose is to share company updates, stay connected, and receive feedback.\nThe entire UX department is invited, though anyone at GitLab is welcome to attend and contribute to the\nAll Hands agenda\n(internal). As with all general meetings at GitLab, attendance is optional though encouraged, and will be recorded.\nRetrospectives\nTo understand the specific challenges faced by the UX Department, we hold an async UX retrospective after every milestone. This retro is carried out through a new Issue created for the recent release in the\nux-retrospectives\nproject. The goal is to evaluate what went well, what didn‚Äôt go well, and how we can improve.\nUX Forum\nThe\nUX Forum\nis a recurring meeting for UX team members to share and discuss their work.\nThis includes past, current, or future work, and covers Product Design, UX Research, and Technical Writing.\nAll meetings are recorded and made available on\nUnfiltered\nfor Product, UX, Engineering, and Leadership to watch at their convenience.\nUX Week in Review\nThe\nUX Week in Review\nis an asynchronous document that includes important updates for everyone in the UX department. This doc is editable by anyone at GitLab and everyone can contribute.\nReminders are sent out weekly in the\n#ux\nSlack channel to add and read updates. UX Managers will receive a monthly reminder in the\n#ux_leadership\nSlack channel to add project updates from across their team.\nUX Talent Assessment\nIn UX, we utilize\nperformance factor worksheets\n(\nüîí internal only\n) as a way to facilitate talent assessment and growth conversations between manager and their direct reports. These worksheets are available in Google Sheets format and the spreadsheets include tabs for a mid-year and year-end review, as well as a tab to list Achievement, Strengths, and Opportunities throughout the year.\nIt is strongly encouraged for each team member to have their own worksheet created at the start of the fiscal year so that it can be used as a tool throughout the entire year.\nPerformance factor worksheets can be utilized to help efficiently complete the year-end company\ntalent assessment program within Workday\n.\nMeet some of our team members\nValerie Karnes\n- Director of Product Design\nJacki Bauer\n- Product Design Manager\nJustin Mandell\n- Product Design Manager\nTaurie Davis\n- Senior Product Design Manager\nRayana Verissimo\n- Product Design Manager\nJeremy Elder\n- Staff Product Designer, Foundations\nAustin Regnery\n- Senior Product Designer\nAnne Lasch\n- Senior UX Researcher\nEmily Bauman\n- Senior Product Designer\nWill Leidheiser\n- Staff UX Researcher\nAssessing Category Maturity\nWe assess the maturity of our product categories based on market evaluations and user testing\nCompetitor Evaluations\nCompetitor evaluations help us understand how a competing product addresses the Jobs-To-Be-Done that our product also tries to address.\nDesign collaborator's playbook\nThis page acts as a quick reference of mental models for sync and async collaboration.\nDocumenting research insights in Dovetail\nThe GitLab UX Research team's guide to documenting insights in Dovetail\nGitLab Navigation\nThe group::personal productivity team owns the navigation structures of the GitLab product. Please review this information if you plan to propose changes to GitLab navigation.\nHow to create a user persona\nThis page goes into detail around the steps needed to create a user persona with a high degree of confidence.\nHow we work\nGuidance on how the UX Department at GitLab works.\nJobs to be Done at GitLab\nJobs to be Done (JTBD) is a framework for viewing products and solutions from the user's perspective, focusing on the problems they want to solve rather than specific solutions. It helps GitLab team members uncover user needs, identify strategic opportunities, validate plans, and drive innovation.\nPajamas Design System\nThe goal of Pajamas is to be the single source of truth for the robust library of UI components that we use to build the GitLab product\nProduct Design\nAt GitLab, our Product Design team drives the business forward by becoming experts in their specific stage groups staying informed about the entire product, and aligning with user and business goals. We partner closely with our stable counterparts in Product Management and Development to deliver exceptional user experiences.\nProduct Designer Workflow\nHere are some guidelines to help Product Designers manage their work at GitLab\nRemote Design Sprint\nThe purpose of a Remote Design Sprint is to create a shared understanding and a solution to a problem following a specific process over a set timeframe. Remote Design Sprint process is based on [Google's Design Sprint methodology](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview), and adjusted using [AJ&Smart's Remote Design Sprint 2.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bwrAqHVf8qxovd87Q7LdzqwAgy7a6Rx/view).\nTechnical Writing\nThe GitLab Technical Writing team collaborates with developers, product managers, and the community ‚Ä¶\nThink Big & Think Small Meetings\nThe purpose of think big & think small meetings is to develop a shared understanding of goals by discussing vision, roadmap, research, design, and delivery of upcoming features.\nUser journeys\nUser journeys help GitLab teams understand and optimize the complete experience of customers as they discover, adopt, and integrate our DevSecOps platform to drive both user success and business value.\nUX Department Learning and Development\nThis page contains links to internal and external resources that members of the UX Department at GitLab can use to build their skills.\nUX Department Performance Indicators\nPerformance indicators for the UX department at GitLab\nUX Forum\nThe UX Forum is a recurring meeting for UX team members to share and discuss their work.\nUX Heuristics\nHeuristics used by the UX team to evaluate our product.\nUX Research at GitLab\nThe UX Research team delivers key and timely insights to drive user-centric innovation, support and influence decisions from design tactics to product strategy.\nUX Research Operations (ReOps) at GitLab\nWe empower UX Research DRIs with the resources needed for efficient and high-quality research, enabling team members to focus on generating insights that drive exceptional user experiences and product innovation.\nUX Resources\nThis page includes information about UX Resources to help you do your job as a product desginer at GitLab.\nUX Scorecards\nThe UX Scorecard is a process similar to a heuristic evaluation that helps identify usability issues and score a given experience.\nLast modified July 2, 2025:\nAdd product dev folder and move relevant pages (\n83bfc789\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 2926}

To make use of this shifted VAT:\nThe vendor/contractor writes the phrase ‚ÄúVAT shifted to recipient according to\narticle 44 and 196 of the European VAT Directive‚Äù on the invoice along with the\nVAT-number of GitLab IT BV (NL860316828B01).\nOn the vendor‚Äôs VAT return the revenue from GitLab BV goes to the rubric ‚ÄúRevenue within the EU‚Äù. It goes without saying that vendors are responsible for their own correct and timely filings.\nGitLab BV files the VAT on the VAT return, and is generally able to deduct this VAT all as part of the same return.\nTimesheets for Hourly Employees\nPeople Ops and Finance will share a private Google Sheet with you where you will log your hours for each day in the ‚Äúhours‚Äù column.\nThere is a dropdown in the ‚Äúpay type‚Äù column, with the default being Regular. There are also options for Overtime, Vacation, Sick, and Bereavement. Choose the appropriate pay type for your time.\nIf you work overtime or more hours than agreed upon in your contract, please obtain approval from your manager and forward to Finance before payroll cutoff.\nYour timesheet is due one day prior to the submit payroll date, which is outlined for the calendar year on your timesheet.\nHow spend is allocated to departments\nBudgets are aligned to departments, and budgets follow the owner who requested the spend. When determining who should request the spend, consider the owner of the outcome.\nFor example, work to enable a sales partner that will not be incorporated into the product would go to Sales. Work that will be part of the product and supported by engineering, should be charged to the Engineering budget.\nFinance Business Partner Alignment\nFunction\nName\nCustomer Support\nR&D Finance\nSales\nSales Finance\nProfessional Services\nSales Finance\nMarketing\nMarketing Finance\nEllen Boyd and Jess Smith\nTypes of Work that the team does\nLevel 1: Keeping the lights on activity.

This, together with our values, is at the core of how we manage our business, including our approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (‚ÄúESG‚Äù).\nOur all-remote team drives GitLab‚Äôs strategy and business results in more than 60 countries worldwide. In FY24, we sharpened our focus on our people by emphasizing the foundational role of high-performing teams and continuing to leverage our core value of diversity, inclusion, and belonging (DIB) to drive innovation and impact across our business. These efforts included launching new training and development programs and additional resources to encourage and enable team members to contribute and to give our people leaders more of the skills they need to manage efficient and effective teams.\nOur ESG strategy also encompasses efforts to minimize our environmental impact and better understand and address the potential effects of climate change on our business. In FY24, we continued to enhance our approach to measuring and reporting our greenhouse gas emissions. We conducted GitLab‚Äôs first climate risk assessment in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and launched the first iteration of a supplier engagement program focused on improving the visibility of emissions in our supply chain.\nWe are committed to good corporate governance and high standards of ethics and compliance. In particular, as we continue to harness the power of AI to enhance the GitLab platform, we recognize the importance of working within a robust framework of ethical principles and protecting our customers‚Äô and users‚Äô data. In early fiscal year 2025, we launched the GitLab AI Transparency Center, giving customers direct access to our AI Ethics Principles for Product Development, AI Continuity Plan, and AI features documentation so that they can adopt AI with confidence.\nLastly, our strategy and mission are also bolstered by engagement with the wider GitLab community. In the last fiscal year, we continued to expand outreach and drive social impact through community programs such as GitLab for Startups, GitLab for Open Source, and GitLab for Education. We also launched GitLab for Nonprofits, which provides free GitLab licenses to registered nonprofit organizations that align with our values and ESG strategy. Our charitable efforts are further complemented by the GitLab Foundation, which supports people in growing their lifetime earnings through education, training, access to opportunities, and systems changes on a global scale.\nAs ever, GitLab ‚Äî the platform and the company ‚Äî is made stronger by the support of our stakeholders, including our team members, customers, shareholders, and the wider community. I am thankful for the contributions so far and look forward to what we can accomplish together in the years ahead.\nSincerely,\nSid Sijbrandij\nGitLab Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\nIntroduction\nOur Mission and Vision\nGitLab‚Äôs\nmission\nis to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world.\nOur mission is the way we realize\nour purpose\n: to help people increase their lifetime earnings through access to opportunities and the DevSecOps platform.\nOur\nvision\nAllOps platform\n‚Äî a single application for all R&D.\nOur efforts are guided by our six core\nvalues\nof Collaboration, Results for Customers, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency. Together, they spell the\nwe give each other by assuming good intent.\nAbout This Report\n‚ÄúWith GitLab‚Äôs second ESG Report, we demonstrate our values of iteration and transparency, sharing how we continue to build on our approach to addressing the issues that matter most to our stakeholders and our business. One key example is the launch of our AI Transparency Center, underscoring how we are leveraging the power of AI within a clear framework of ethics, responsibility, and accountability. As our innovation continues to break down barriers, we recognize the increasing opportunity of integrating our business and sustainability strategies to create value for our customers, our shareholders, our team members, and the broader community.‚Äù\n‚Äì\nRobin Schulman\n, Chief Legal Officer, Head of Corporate Affairs, and Corporate Secretary\nGitLab‚Äôs Environmental, Social, and Governance (‚ÄúESG‚Äù) Report includes information on our key ESG focus areas, our programs and policies, achievements to date, metrics and targets that help define our ESG program, and our plans for the future.

The content included covers Fiscal Year 2024 (‚ÄúFY24‚Äù) (as of January 31, 2024) and we plan to update the report annually.

We would also like to note that GitLab maintains a public-facing\nhandbook\n, pages of which are linked throughout the report. These pages are maintained separately and may reflect a different reporting period than this report.\nThis report has been prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (‚ÄúGRI‚Äù) Standards released in October 2021 and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúSASB‚Äù) Standard for Software & IT Services. We have also provided disclosures based on the framework of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‚ÄúTCFD‚Äù). Content indexes for these standards are available in the\nAppendix\n.\nGitLab‚Äôs Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on the Board of Directors (‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) has reviewed the information in this report.\nFor information on GitLab‚Äôs ESG Team, please visit the\nESG handbook page\n.\nOur Approach to ESG\nESG Strategy\nGitLab‚Äôs ESG strategy is driven by our\nvalues\nand deeply integrated into the company‚Äôs business philosophy. It reflects longstanding practices embedded in our work culture since GitLab‚Äôs inception, as well as updated policies and programs designed to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our stakeholders.\nThe\nESG Team\ncreates and maintains GitLab‚Äôs ESG/sustainability strategy and programs. This includes creating and managing GitLab‚Äôs ESG disclosures and public ESG reports, identifying and prioritizing key issues to advance our social and environmental goals, and creating partnerships with nonprofit organizations that support GitLab‚Äôs values and mission.\nESG Materiality Assessment\nOur ESG strategy is informed by an understanding of the ESG topics that matter most to our business and our stakeholders. Completed in December 2022, our ESG materiality assessment included engagement with internal and external stakeholders and a focus on ‚Äúdouble materiality,‚Äù exploring both topics that have the greatest impact on GitLab‚Äôs business, as well as the actual and potential impact of our activities on the environment, society, and our global communities. GitLab senior leadership ‚Äî including members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of GitLab‚Äôs Board of Directors ‚Äî were engaged as part of the assessment.\nThe materiality assessment identified the following key ESG topics:\nSocial\nTalent and Engagement\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB)\nEnvironment\nClimate Action and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nGovernance\nInformation Security and Data Privacy\nResponsible Product Development\nBusiness Ethics\nWe also include in this report other topics relevant to our business and stakeholders, including Community, Social Impact, and Corporate Governance.\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals Alignment\nThe\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (‚ÄúUN SDGs‚Äù)\nprovide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. Our ESG efforts currently align with five of the 17 UN SDGs, and we seek to drive progress on the goals within our operations. We will continue to revisit and deepen our alignment as we make progress on our ESG strategy.\nSocial\nTalent and Engagement\n(UN SDG #8 and 10)\nWe‚Äôre a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, GitLab, and the broader GitLab community succeed.\nOur mission\n(to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers the world) means that our team members can ‚Äî and are expected to ‚Äî make an impact across the company. We empower them by cultivating a high-performance and results-driven culture ‚Äî one that enables people to do their best work and advance their careers while fully contributing towards advancing GitLab‚Äôs business results. We hire, promote, and recognize those team members who best live our\nvalues\n.\nWe also leverage team members‚Äô unique skills and experiences to drive extraordinary outcomes. We believe that when team members seek feedback from a diverse group of peers and leaders, inside and outside of their group or function, they make better decisions and feel more connected. We work to make everyone feel welcome and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in our community and company.\nOur entire workforce is remote, making it easier for people of diverse backgrounds and abilities to join the team. As GitLab has evolved, we have learned a great deal about what it takes to build and manage a fully remote team, which we share through our publicly available\nhandbook\n.\nTalent Management\nOur approach to talent management is underscored by our values, particularly of transparency and diversity, inclusion, and belonging. It is also bolstered by the resources we provide to help our team members grow and succeed.\nThrough our website and\nhandbook\n, we are transparent about\navailable positions\n,\nbenefits\n,\njob descriptions\n,\nonboarding\nand\noffboarding\nprocedures, facilitating connections with various internal groups, and much more.\nWe also work to build a diverse team to drive extraordinary outcomes by expanding outreach and inclusivity initiatives to increase the number of team members and our Manager+ population who identify as part of an underrepresented group.\nOur\nPeople Group\nis dedicated to supporting each team member through their career journey at GitLab. They enable GitLab‚Äôs strategy through a focus on attracting and retaining diverse talent, creating a high-performance culture with a focus on efficiency and quality results, driving divisional success through talent programs, and cultivating an equitable and inclusive culture. This includes developing and maintaining our\ntalent brand\n, facilitating ongoing\nlearning and development\n, and providing resources for team members to\nconnect\n, share concerns, and seek\nsupport\n.\nIn FY24, we focused on accelerating GitLab‚Äôs 3-year strategy through re-emphasizing the foundational role of high-performing teams. At GitLab, high-performing teams:\nAct with urgency to deliver key results\nHold individuals and teams accountable for great work\nTrust each other\nDeliver results on time\nCollaborate with open and effective communication\nWe educate team members about our values through trainings,\nvideos\n, workshops, forums, certifications, and ambassadors, which are designed to reinforce our values as key drivers of our high-performance, results-driven culture.\nDeveloping Our Leaders\nManagers at GitLab support our mission of enabling everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. We need to equip our people leaders with the skills to lead globally dispersed, all-remote teams to support our business growth at scale.\nElevate\nis GitLab‚Äôs leadership training program for Managers and Senior Managers, which prepares managers with skills they need to build high-performing teams. In FY24, we certified 73% of our eligible Managers and Senior Managers in Elevate. Although this fell short of our goal of 85%‚Äîdue to business-critical initiatives, some team members had to delay certification for a year‚Äîit demonstrated positive momentum for the program and contributed to the company‚Äôs strong performance throughout the year.\nDuring FY24, we also developed and launched additional tools to help participants deepen and continue their learning beyond initial certification.\nElevate Applied\nis an ongoing resource that enables Managers and Senior Managers to connect with each other and practice, apply, and integrate concepts taught in Elevate in their day-to-day work at GitLab.\nIn addition, we developed and announced the FY25 launch of\nElevate+\n, a six-month program designed to enable senior leaders (Directors and Senior Directors) to better understand and practice behaviors anchored in GitLab‚Äôs values and leadership competencies, develop new skills to support high-priority business needs, and help establish and strengthen cross-functional connections.\nTalent Engagement\nWe strive to foster a culture of continuous growth so that GitLab remains a great place to work. A positive impact on team member experience leads to a positive impact on results for GitLab and its customers.\nOur\nTalent Development\nteam (commonly referred to as ‚ÄúLearning & Development‚Äô‚Äô) enhances team member performance, expands capabilities, and further develops skills that make GitLab team members the top talent in the industry. Our vision is to be recognized as a top organization for remote learning and development and to create a future where everyone contributes to a culture of curiosity. We accomplish this by focusing on skill-based learning, providing resources to enhance career mobility, and developing learning journeys for teams throughout the organization.\nTo support our aim of facilitating accessible, remote-friendly development for all, we provide asynchronous access to learning opportunities, including:\nLevel Up\n, our learning management software, which is designed to facilitate and centralize the learning experience for GitLab team members.\nSelf-paced external trainings\n, for accessing role-specific training courses and learning materials from industry-leading providers.\nCareer Development and Mobility\n, providing resources and direction to help team members engage in lifelong growth to meet their unique goals.\nGrowth and Development Fund\n, enabling team members to access external resources to develop their skills and careers.\nAs a global, all-remote company with a team of diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, GitLab offers a dynamic environment and culture where everyone is encouraged to do their best work. Our talent brand empowers team members to share their thoughts on\nwhat it‚Äôs like to work here\nbecause their voices and stories make GitLab unique and successful.\n‚ÄúBy fully embracing the values, GitLab has changed the way I work. I have become more productive and satisfied with the work I do, while also having a better work-life balance. It‚Äôs motivating to work somewhere so amazing with such great people.‚Äù ‚Äì Cynthia, Strategy and Operations, Office of the CEO\nEngagement Surveys\nWe conduct a number of\nengagement surveys\nthat enable us to capture honest feedback from our team members, understand engagement levels across the organization, and respond to changing needs. By making small iterations and moving quickly, we can get the data needed to evolve engagement programs as needed and align our priorities to the areas team members care about most. Our key survey tools include the annual CultureAmp Engagement survey, Employer Award surveys, and other ad hoc measures like Organizational Health surveys.\nIn FY24, our Annual\nEngagement Survey\nreached 88% participation and indicated an overall engagement score of 75% favorable. This is 2% higher than our\nNew Tech\npeer group, which gives us confidence in knowing we have a highly engaged team member community. Additional highlights included:\n94% agree: ‚ÄúI enjoy engaging with my peers at GitLab.‚Äù\n92% agree: ‚ÄúIt is easy to ask other members of your team for help.‚Äù\nSubsequently, our global year-end pulse survey demonstrated positive momentum with an overall engagement score of 79% favorable (+4%). In addition, 91% of participants said they‚Äôre proud to work at GitLab, while 86% rated GitLab as a great place to work.\nGitLab received\nGreat Place to Work Certification\nfor the 4th year in a row in May 2024 with 93% of its U.S. based team members saying that they believe GitLab is a great place to work.\nGreat Place to Work\nrecognizes companies for their outstanding workplace culture, benefits, and performance through successful completion of a survey for US-based team members and culture brief application.\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\n(UN SDG #5, 8, and 10)\nWe are committed to a future where the\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n(‚ÄúDIB‚Äù) value empowers everyone to contribute.\nAs a globally dispersed organization serving customers all over the world, we strive for a team that is representative of our users, an open and transparent work culture where all voices are heard and welcomed, and an environment where everyone can show up as their full selves and contribute to their best ability each day.\nWe believe this not only makes GitLab a great place to work but also supports innovation and promotes better decision-making, helping us continue to deliver results for customers.\nOur DIB focus also extends to how we show up for people outside of GitLab, through initiatives that promote DIB in our industry and the broader community. To put it simply, we need the contributions of everyone in order to empower our team members, help our users change the world, and transform the industry.\nWe do this through our A.D.A.P.T. strategy:\nction ‚Äì Puts intentionality into how we attract, progress, and retain our team members, engage with our customers, and diversify the open source community.\no Good ‚Äì By providing avenues and opportunities for GitLab and team members to meaningfully contribute to our community and society.\nccountable ‚Äì We hold ourselves accountable in the commitments we make as well as being answerable for the outcome.\nolicies ‚Äì scalable processes and policies inform and govern our program development and execution.\nransparent ‚Äì Our internal efforts are shared externally.\nAdditionally, to continue to drive progress, we‚Äôve organized our DIB work into three pillars: empowering our people, uplifting our communities, and building inclusivity into all we do.\nEmpowering Our People\nGrowing Our Talent & Their Experience\nOur team members are critical to our success. We provide pathways for them to thrive individually and as a part of the GitLab community.\nLevel Up\n‚Äì Our learning platform is designed to deploy learning content across GitLab internal team members.\nCareer development and mobility\n‚Äì We provide resources and direction to help team members engage in lifelong growth to meet their unique career goals.\nTeam Member Resource Groups\n(TMRGs) ‚Äì TMRGs cultivate an inclusive workplace and empower our employees by fostering a supportive environment where everyone can thrive. Our TMRGs are open to all team members, not just those who specifically identify with a particular group.\nAsian/Pacific Islander\nBlack@GitLab\nCaregivers\nDisabilities and Neurodivergence\nGente\nGenerational Understanding\nGlobal Voices\nPride\nGitLab Women\nTeam Member Advocacy Groups\n(TMAGs) ‚Äì TMAGs are groups that share common interests and work together to drive change on behalf of the community through education, action, and enablement across a specific need.\nCareer Enablement\nMental Health ‚Äì Coming soon\nLeadership in Action\nFrom education to mentorship, sponsorship, and advocacy, GitLab educates its leaders, provides resources for its team members, and holds its leaders accountable so that team members feel empowered to utilize the community they are surrounded by every day.\nTMRG Executive Sponsors\n‚Äì VP+ leaders who volunteer to support, advocate, and connect TMRG communities to our shared GitLab mission and vision and E-Group leaders.\nLeadership DIB Council\n‚Äì A strategic group of senior leaders who assist the DIB team in implementing and aligning the strategy to each division‚Äôs strategic imperatives.\nSponsorship\n‚Äì VP+ leaders advocate and provide visibility and guidance to our team members for growth and career advancement.\nEquipping Our People Leaders\n‚Äì Our leadership training ensures that DIB is considered and threaded throughout the team member experience.\nElevate ‚Äì Manager training\nElevate+ ‚Äì Director+ inclusive leadership training\nElevate Applied ‚Äì Continuous learning for Elevate graduates\nUplifting Our Communities\nCommunity partnerships are a great way for GitLab to engage with the community externally, provide opportunities for career development and networking for our team members, and also add layers of DIB to key areas of our organization. Partnerships are also how we measure our inclusive practices against industry standards and can act as accountability partners in achieving success.\nExternal Engagement\n‚Äì We sponsor and support events worldwide that promote inclusion and belonging, and create learning and growth opportunities for our team. By networking with diverse talent at these events, we infuse our team with fresh perspectives and ideas. Reflecting on a year of impactful partnerships, we are inspired to further foster spaces where technology and diverse talent converge, giving everyone a voice.\nDo Good\n‚Äì Throughout the year, the DIB and ESG teams collaborate to give back to the communities we serve by offering volunteer opportunities to team members, working with TMRGs to donate funds to relevant nonprofits, and providing in-kind donations to DIB related nonprofits through the\nGitLab for Nonprofits\nprogram.\nBuilding Inclusivity Into All We Do\nWhen we think about DIB, it‚Äôs easy to see it only from a team member perspective. Our goal is to bring inclusivity into as many touch points as possible ‚Äî from our open source contributors to how we engage with our customers and users.\nDEI Project Badging Program\n‚Äì In FY24, GitLab partnered with the Linux Foundation through the Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software (\n) project to enable open source projects to signal their focus on building and growing diverse communities.\nDigital Accessibility\n‚Äì At GitLab, we build understanding, empathy, and allyship around accessibility. We do this through various methods internally, including\nInclusive Design Principles\n, Digital Accessibility Training, webinars, and workshops, to ensure that our Product and Engineering teams are equipped with the skills necessary to make our product more accessible.\nInclusive Hiring\n‚Äì GitLab strives to create an equitable application, interview, selection, and offer process for all candidates to ensure we‚Äôre building a diverse and inclusive workforce around the globe as the company continues to grow.\nDIB Working Group\n‚Äì A strategic group of impactful team members who collaborate to drive action and results in support of DIB. This includes promoting inclusive practices in areas such as name pronunciation, pronoun education, and meeting etiquette in an all-remote workplace.\nLooking Ahead\nWe followed through on our commitments and accomplished a lot in 2023, but we still have work to do. We are continuing to build DIB into every part of GitLab ‚Äì both internally with our team members and externally with our customers, users, partners, and open source community.\nWe have committed to four key objectives in FY25:\nDeliver our supplier diversity strategy\n‚Äì We have set an aspirational goal to double the number of suppliers categorized as diverse. To achieve this aspirational goal, we are engaging partners, strategically embedding diversity, inclusion and belonging practices into our procurement process, and evaluating our current suppliers‚Äô practices in line with applicable anti-discrimination principles.\nIncrease representation\n‚Äì Extend our representation of team members from our Disabilities, Neurodivergence and LGBTQIA+  communities. We are working with several partners to help us achieve this goal including but not limited to, Unicorns in Tech, DisabilityIN, and Anita B. Org. Visit\nthis Handbook page\nto learn more about how we select partners and measure success in attracting team members from these communities.\nEmerging Talent @ GitLab\n‚Äì Our mission is to attract, acquire, and activate talent to unlock their potential, connecting learning agility with employment opportunities, decoupled from academic-based prerequisites. This is anchored on the belief that building a balanced workforce will enable GitLab to scale effectively and inclusively, and that building a strong foundation today will greatly impact our future growth.\nEnsure inclusive leadership\n‚Äì Inclusive leadership is integrated into leadership development experiences and offered as voluntary resources to promote ongoing education and awareness. These experiences span all front-line and aspiring leaders in addition to VP and E-Group populations.\nGitLab Community\nFrom the beginning, GitLab has been an\nopen source project\nmade possible by contributions from its community. Contributors to GitLab ‚Äî the platform and the company ‚Äî make up the GitLab community and are fundamental to GitLab‚Äôs strategy and mission.\nThe\nDeveloper Relations\nteam supports GitLab‚Äôs mission by working with our community to ensure they receive support and recognition for contributing to GitLab. This involves a multifaceted approach that includes creating educational content, organizing events and workshops, developing programs, and providing platforms for knowledge exchange and collaboration. The team focuses not only on promoting GitLab‚Äôs features and capabilities but also on actively listening to and incorporating feedback from our community to inform product development and improvements.\nGitLab Community Programs\nGitLab‚Äôs\nCommunity Programs\naim to put GitLab‚Äôs most powerful features in the hands of communities that may not otherwise have the means to access them, helping them to grow and thrive. Members of the Community Programs team serve as liaisons, tracking the ways their respective communities prefer using GitLab and translating that knowledge into insights that help GitLab create a better product.\nWhile each program is unique in its organization and execution, benefits may include:\nComplimentary subscriptions of GitLab Ultimate\nDirect lines of communication to GitLab team members\nOpportunities to partner with GitLab for presentations and events\nOur key community programs include the following:\nLaunched in FY24,\nGitLab for Startups\nhelps qualifying startups streamline their development processes and improve collaboration by providing free access to GitLab Ultimate for one year, followed by deeply discounted access to any tier for a second year. Current participants include several startups focused on delivering innovative sustainability solutions, such as\nBreathe Battery Technologies\n,\nVerity Nature\n, and\nClimaSens\n.\nThe\nGitLab for Open Source\nprogram provides qualifying projects with no-cost subscriptions of GitLab Ultimate. By empowering open source projects with our most advanced features, GitLab for Open Source supports our mission and helps make GitLab the best place for open source projects to grow and thrive.\nThe\nGitLab for Education\nprogram aims to enable educational institutions to succeed in teaching, learning, and conducting research with GitLab. We seek to build an engaged community of GitLab users around the world who actively contribute to GitLab and each other‚Äôs success and ultimately become evangelists of GitLab in the workplace and beyond. As of January 2024, the GitLab for Education program provides over 3.5 million seats of GitLab Ultimate at more than 1,800 educational institutions in more than 74 countries.\nFor information on GitLab for Nonprofits, see\nSocial Impact\nbelow.\nOther Community Initiatives\nFinding an open source community to learn, connect, and grow with can be a challenge for many developers. To better align on best practices for building inclusive open source communities and to ensure that our DIB value is reflected in our contributor community, GitLab has partnered with the\nproject to integrate GitLab with their recently released\nDEI Project Badging program\n. The DEI Project Badging program enables open source projects to:\nClearly signal their focus on building diverse communities\nMore easily highlight the work they are doing to welcome and support new members\nAdd visual badges to their projects to indicate their community‚Äôs reflection on the CHAOSS DEI badging metrics\nTo learn more about how the program works and how GitLab and CHAOSS worked together to bring it to the wider community, see our\nblog post\n.\nIn FY24, our Contributor Success Team sought to enhance community relations and contribute to sustainability by allowing teams to recognize contributors by sponsoring tree planting in lieu of traditional rewards like swag. Through a partnership with\nTree-Nation\n, we have the ability to plant trees on behalf of others, and others can also pay to plant trees in our forest. Similarly, our Marketing team offers attendees at GitLab events the opportunity to plant trees through\nRewards.Earth\n.\nSocial Impact\n(UN SDG #4 and 10)\nCharitable Giving\nLaunched in 2023, GitLab‚Äôs\nPhilanthropy Policy\nsupports GitLab teams that want to engage in charitable giving and activities benefiting registered nonprofit organizations that align with GitLab‚Äôs mission, values, and ESG strategy. By enabling teams to contribute to causes aligned with their work, we foster connections between GitLab‚Äôs purpose and values and the opportunity to drive impact in the broader community. For example, in FY24:\nGitLab Women\n, our TMRG that helps women advance their skills and leadership potential, donated funds to\nWomen Who Code\n, a national organization focused on empowering women to excel in technology careers.\nParticipants in our sales incentive program, GitLab President‚Äôs Club, built filter kits with\nWater to Wine\n, an international nonprofit committed to building a holistic, community-based model by supporting the life and dignity of all through the power of clean water.\nGitLab for Nonprofits\nDuring FY24, we also launched our in-kind donation program,\nGitLab for Nonprofits\n, which gives free GitLab licenses to registered nonprofit organizations that align with our values and ESG strategy. Nonprofits accepted into the program are provided a free Ultimate license for one year for up to 20 seats. In the first six months of the program, we granted licenses to more than 100 qualified nonprofits.\n‚ÄúGitLab is our canvas for workflow across our nonprofit organization. It allows us to do everything from planning and managing the workloads for our teams all the way to the CI/CD pipelines, which automate efforts ranging from routine tasks to platform deployments in our various environments. Whether it‚Äôs documenting processes in place with issue templates or structuring organization-wide initiatives with interdependent issues, epics, and milestones, GitLab gives us the structure we need, with the flexibility to meet our unique needs.\"\n‚ÄìMike Bowie, Chief Technology Officer, Last Mile\nVolunteer Initiatives\nThrough our\nGiveLab program\n, we encourage team members to take part in volunteer initiatives that support and ultimately uplift their local communities.\nIn FY24, GitLab provided virtual volunteer opportunities for team members through a partnership with\nSuitUp\n, a nonprofit that equips students for life beyond the classroom by partnering with schools/youth organizations and businesses to develop, organize, and implement engaging educational competitions in communities across the U.S. and beyond.\n‚ÄúWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to GitLab for their invaluable partnership with SuitUp in 2023. GitLab‚Äôs commitment to youth education has not only paved a clear pathway for our students‚Äô success, but has opened abundant opportunities for their development in STEM careers and beyond. We are deeply thankful to the GitLab team for their dedication and the transformative impact they have had on the lives and futures of our SuitUp students across the globe.‚Äù\n‚ÄìKelsey English Smith, SuitUp‚Äôs Interim Chief Executive Officer\nGitLab Foundation\nGitLab is dedicated to supporting charitable organizations with missions that align with our company‚Äôs values through the GitLab Foundation. Established in 2022, the GitLab Foundation focuses on supporting people to grow their lifetime earnings through education, training, access to opportunities, and systems change on a global scale. Its vision is a world in which one million more people can afford a better life.\nThe GitLab Foundation is funded by GitLab and its co-founder, Sid Sijbrandij. When GitLab went public in 2021, the Board approved a 1% share donation to capitalize the GitLab Foundation. In FY24, 1,635,545 shares of Class A common stock were registered to be issued to the GitLab Foundation.\nThe GitLab Foundation is an independent nonprofit entity and its operations are autonomous from GitLab. To learn more, please visit the\nGitLab Foundation\n.\nEnvironment\nClimate Action and Greenhouse (GHG) Emissions\nAround the world, many communities are already experiencing climate impacts such as warmer temperatures, more frequent severe weather events, and changes in water availability and other vital ecosystem services. With this in mind, GitLab is committed to doing our part to minimize our environmental footprint, including working to reduce GHG emissions associated with our operations.\nAs a fully remote company, GitLab has no Scope 1 (direct) emissions or Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity for company-owned facilities, meaning that 100% of our footprint comes from Scope 3 emissions. Our FY24 GHG inventory measures emissions associated with purchased goods and services (which includes cloud services), capital goods, employee commuting (which includes remote work), business travel, and investments (as defined under Category 15 of the GHG Protocol).\nOur emissions increased in FY24 partially due to improvements in our methodology. For FY24, we estimated emissions using the Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA), a multi-regional economic and environmental database, as it better reflects the global nature of supply chains, helping capture differences in emissions profiles that vary significantly from one country to another. We also expanded our measurement to include emissions from investments (as defined under Category 15 of the GHG Protocol).\nMore detailed results of our inventory are available in the\nPerformance Data Table\n. Our third-party assurance letter of our FY24 GHG inventory is available\nhere\n.\nIn FY24, we took steps to further understand our climate impacts and advance the development of a formal emissions reduction strategy. This included initiating GitLab‚Äôs first climate risk assessment, to help us better understand climate-related risks and opportunities for our business. For more information on our climate risk assessment and scenario analysis, please see our\nTCFD Index\n.\nIn FY24, we also launched a supplier engagement program with a focus on climate. As an initial step, we engaged our top 20 suppliers by spend who are not currently disclosing emissions data, asking them to start measuring their emissions and sharing the data publicly. We will be expanding the scope of the engagement to include more suppliers in FY25.\nIn FY25, we will continue working to establish GHG emissions reduction targets. We have also launched the first iteration of a team member\nsustainability guide\nwith the goal of educating GitLab team members on how to be more sustainable.\nIn January 2024, GitLab purchased and retired carbon removal credits worth 8,580 tonnes of CO2e. The purchase funds a reforestation program called Trees for Global Benefits, a long-running cooperative carbon offsetting program that combines community-led activities to increase carbon sequestration, encourage sustainable land-use practices, and provide farmers with performance-based payments. We also retired additional credits worth 877 tonnes of CO2e that were purchased in FY23.\nGovernance\nCorporate Governance\nGitLab is strongly committed to good corporate governance practices, which provide an important framework within which our\nBoard\nand\nexecutive leadership\ncan pursue our strategic objectives for the benefit of our shareholders.\nThe Board‚Äôs duty is to serve as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and to oversee the management of the company‚Äôs business. To fulfill its responsibilities and discharge its duty, the Board follows the procedures and standards set forth by GitLab‚Äôs\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nand\nother governance documents\n.\nBoard members‚Äô responsibilities include:\nRisk oversight\nMonitoring the performance of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other\nExecutive\nleaders\nGiving feedback on the\nmission\n,\nvalues\n, and strategy\nEvaluating if adequate resources are available to achieve our goals and that those resources are used effectively\nAdvocating for GitLab externally\nParticipating in\nBoard meetings\nParticipating on\nBoard committees\nThe Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The composition and responsibilities of each committee are described in our\nProxy Statement\nand in the\nInvestor Relations section\nof our website.\nBoard committees oversee and review areas of risk that are particularly relevant to them based on their responsibilities and charters. GitLab‚Äôs management regularly provides reports to support the Board‚Äôs oversight obligations. This reporting cadence provides visibility and information regarding the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks and the company‚Äôs risk mitigation strategies.\nThe\ncharter\nof the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee tasks the committee with assisting the Board in overseeing company programs relating to corporate responsibility and sustainability, including ESG matters. GitLab‚Äôs Senior Director, ESG, reports to the Chief Legal Officer (who is also the Head of Corporate Affairs and Corporate Secretary) weekly and to GitLab‚Äôs executive leadership as needed. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets at least twice per year and ESG topics are discussed with this committee as well as with the full Board as needed.\nInformation Security and Data Privacy\nAt GitLab, we recognize that to maintain trust and deliver the world‚Äôs leading DevSecOps platform, security and privacy must remain our top priorities. Our information security and privacy practices reflect our dedication to safeguarding customer data and building security into the core of our product and our company.\nSecurity Assurance\nThe GitLab\nSecurity Division‚Äôs\nmission is to enable everyone to innovate and succeed on a safe, secure, and trusted DevSecOps platform. As part of this mission, the\nSecurity Assurance\nDepartment is responsible for monitoring and reporting on GitLab‚Äôs compliance with various security frameworks and standards and for providing GitLab customers with a high level of assurance around the security of GitLab Cloud Services, which is comprised of GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated.\nTo help ensure that user information is protected, we employ a range of administrative, technical, and physical security controls. For more information on our security practices, please see our\nTechnical and Organizational Security Measures\nfor GitLab Cloud Services.\nWe maintain various security certifications covering GitLab Cloud Services, including ISO/IEC 27001:2013, ISO/IEC 27017:2015, and ISO/IEC 27018:2019. In FY24, we expanded our compliance portfolio to include a SOC 2, Type II report for GitLab Dedicated and added TISAX AL-2 certification for GitLab Cloud Services.\nIn January 2024, we enhanced customer access to assurance resources with the launch of the updated GitLab\nTrust Center\n. The Trust Center provides a single, unified location for communicating our compliance and assurance credentials, hosting our security and privacy documentation for customer consumption, sharing important notices, and hosting our internal knowledge base where customers can readily access the same answers we provide in questionnaire responses. This self-service approach not only provides customers with increased visibility of critical information but also enables them to accomplish security and risk reviews quickly and efficiently.\nCybersecurity\nGitLab‚Äôs cybersecurity program was designed in alignment with industry standards and recognized best practices to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. Identified risks are assessed for criticality, prioritized for remediation, and reported by GitLab‚Äôs security teams to various levels of our management. Our global incident response team iteratively evaluates security events for impact, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Security incidents that are assessed as potentially material are escalated to designated members of our senior management and Board, as applicable.\nOur security program also accounts for potential cybersecurity risks associated with third parties with whom we do business. These risks are continually assessed throughout the vendor lifecycle, from onboarding to offboarding. We also engage in continuous monitoring of our cybersecurity risks and perform security assurance activities via independent, external third parties such as consultants, auditors, and assessors during our robust security certification audits, penetration tests, and bug bounty programs.\nThe Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, including compliance with disclosure requirements and related effects on financial and other risks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for consideration. Management is responsible for and regularly discusses identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis through programs led by the Chief Information Security Officer, the Chief Legal Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer.\nFor more information, see our FY24\nForm 10-K\nand our GitLab\nTrust Center\n.\nData Privacy\nGitLab is fully committed to protecting the personal data of its customers, team members, suppliers, and other stakeholders in accordance with global comprehensive data privacy laws. We take the privacy of personal data very seriously and have initiated a variety of methods and controls so that we know what data we collect and hold and that it is protected appropriately.\nOur\nPrivacy Statement\nprovides details on how we collect, share, use, and protect personal information and on the choices that customers and users have regarding their personal data. Users also have the right to access, correct, restrict, or delete personal data and to port personal data to another company. Although legal and regulatory requirements related to data privacy may vary by jurisdiction, GitLab provides users with the same rights and choices no matter where they live. For more information on our privacy practices, see our\nPrivacy Statement\n.\nThe\nPrivacy Team\n(part of GitLab‚Äôs Legal and Corporate Affairs Team) provides support and guidance to uphold consistent business processes around the protection of personal data. Privacy Team members collaborate cross-functionally and serve as advocates to ensure that the data privacy practices of GitLab meet the needs of our cross-functional partners and are continually balanced with an ever-changing global data privacy and protection landscape.\nThe GitLab\nData Classification Standard\ndefines data categories and provides a matrix of security and privacy controls for the purposes of determining the level of protection to be applied to GitLab data throughout its lifecycle.\nAs part of our commitment to privacy, GitLab ensures that, where appropriate, projects and personal data processing activities are subject to Privacy Reviews and a\nData Protection Impact Assessment\n(DPIA) as key components of a ‚ÄòPrivacy by Design‚Äô approach.\nResponsible Product Development\nGitLab‚Äôs\nproduct mission\nis to consistently create products and experiences that users love and value. We believe this includes our responsibility to\ndesign inclusive products\nthat aim to provide access to content and functionality that enables consumption and contribution from everyone. Our\nproduct principles\nguide us in developing products consistent with the approach of other world-class product organizations.\nWe strive to set an example by empowering our wider GitLab community to build and work with the highest levels of security through our DevSecOps platform. This extends to how we are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and continuously evolving the platform to enable secure, responsible development.\nResponsible AI\nGitLab is dedicated to responsibly building artificial intelligence (AI) into and throughout our comprehensive DevSecOps platform. We offer GitLab Duo, a\nfull suite of AI capabilities\nacross the GitLab platform so that our customers can ship better, more secure software faster. GitLab Duo follows a privacy- and transparency-first approach to help customers confidently adopt AI while keeping their valuable assets protected.\nAs we work to integrate new AI-powered features into the platform, we do not simply adopt the latest advancements for their own sake. Instead, we take a strategic,\nintentional approach\n, ensuring that the features we add have a clear purpose, appropriate controls, and safeguards to protect users‚Äô data. This includes a\npolicy\nnot to use customers‚Äô or users‚Äô AI inputs to train any language models without their instruction or prior consent.\nIn early 2024, we launched the GitLab\nAI Transparency Center\nto enable our customers to confidently unlock the enormous potential of AI and emphasize our customer-centric approach to responsible AI development and deployment. The AI Transparency Center currently includes GitLab‚Äôs\nAI Ethics Principles for Product Development\n,\nAI Continuity Plan\n, and\nAI features documentation\n. The principles and policies in our AI Transparency Center govern how we responsibly select AI models to use based on an extensive model evaluation process. The launch of the center was a cross-functional effort led by the Legal and Corporate Affairs (LACA) team in partnership with the Product, Security, and Marketing teams.\nSecurity and Governance\nOur commitment to responsible product development also encompasses how we support customers in ensuring security and responsibility throughout the software development lifecycle. GitLab‚Äôs security and governance capabilities include a wide range of controls, such as automatic scanning of project dependencies for security vulnerabilities, license compliance, and other risks; vulnerability management and security scanning; security and compliance policies; and comprehensive anti-abuse tools. In FY24, we introduced several enhancements, including support for\ncustom roles\n, expanded security\npolicies\n, improved security scanner accuracy, and support for\ngroup-level dependency lists\nfor centralized dependency management.\nContinuous Integration and Delivery\nThe incorporation of end-to-end\ncontinuous integration and delivery\n(CI/CD) features in GitLab supports the default integration of best practices, empowering users to focus on developing code with speed, security, and quality in mind. This includes automated code testing capabilities that make software development easier, faster, and less risky for developers.\nIn FY24, we continued to enhance GitLab‚Äôs CI/CD offering with new features such as\ncomponents\n, preconfigured CI/CD files that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications, and\nexpanded runner machine types\nto enable faster CI/CD pipelines. We also improved key GitLab features such as\nvariables\nand\nsecrets\n, helping users make more informed decisions about their data and application security while also supporting the best practices in design and secure workflows.\nBusiness Ethics\nGitLab is committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical business conduct. It has long operated its business consistent with operating principles and policies that reinforce this commitment. GitLab complies with all laws and regulations that are applicable to its activities and expects all team members to adhere to our ethical standards and legal and regulatory obligations. These expectations are reflected and reinforced by our\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n(‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù) and various supporting\npolicies, procedures, and other resources\n(collectively, ‚ÄúCompliance Standards‚Äù).\nIn FY24, we centralized our compliance efforts. The\nEthics and Compliance Program\n, is designed to help GitLab team members maintain its culture of compliance and to promote ethical decision-making by:\nEnsuring that Compliance Standards are current, easy to find, and widely available to team members;\nMonitoring the regulatory landscape for developments and updating our policies, as necessary, to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\nEducating our team members on our policies and reporting avenues through training, awareness initiatives, and other outreach efforts;\nProviding guidance and resolving related inquiries involving, for example, conflicts of interests and gifts and entertainment; and,\nEncouraging and facilitating appropriate risk assessment, due diligence, and remediation to deter, detect, and address unlawful, unethical, and discriminatory conduct.\nBoard Oversight\nThe Board, through its Audit Committee, is responsible for administering the Code of Conduct, and for addressing material issues and risks concerning Compliance Standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Audit Committee has delegated day-to-day responsibility for administering and interpreting the Code of Conduct to GitLab‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer.\nTeam Member Responsibilities\nEach team member is responsible for reading, understanding, and ultimately complying with GitLab‚Äôs Compliance Standards. Team members are expected to deal honestly, ethically, and fairly with customers, partners, suppliers, competitors, and other third parties. GitLab expressly prohibits team members from violating applicable laws and regulations, and any team member who does so may face disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal (subject to local law). To memorialize and reinforce GitLab‚Äôs expectations, we require each team member to review and acknowledge our Code of Conduct on an annual basis.\nTeam members are educated on GitLab‚Äôs policies and procedures and related laws and regulations through continuous training, both at onboarding and throughout the year, and awareness campaigns. Team members are encouraged to ask questions about our policies and seek guidance when necessary through various avenues, including a Slack channel dedicated to ethics and compliance.\nReporting of Concerns and Violations\nGitLab strives to foster a work environment in which ethical issues and concerns may be raised and discussed with supervisors or others without\nfear of retribution\n. If a team member becomes aware of a suspected or actual violation of law, regulation, or GitLab Compliance Standards, they have a responsibility to promptly report their concern in accordance with GitLab‚Äôs Whistleblower Policy and Code of Conduct.\nGitLab offers team members a variety of ways to report suspected or actual violations. Team members may raise their concerns orally or in writing to their direct supervisor or manager, to GitLab‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, or to the Audit Committee.\nAt any time, team members may also submit reports using EthicsPoint, a GitLab-provided tool that is available 24 hours a day and allows for anonymous reporting about conduct addressed in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Reports to EthicsPoint can be submitted using a toll-free hotline or through the EthicsPoint\nwebsite\n. In addition to EthicsPoint, GitLab has engaged\nLighthouse Services\nto provide an anonymous hotline for team members to submit reports involving team member relations.\nGitLab treats all reports seriously. Notification of reports submitted via EthicsPoint is automatically provided to the Chief Legal Officer and Chairperson of the Audit Committee and those reports are promptly and thoroughly investigated by qualified personnel at the direction of the Chief Legal Officer, as appropriate. Reports involving team member relations are reported to the People Group team.\nPartner Ethics\nGitLab‚Äôs commitment to legal and ethical conduct extends to its suppliers, contractors, resellers, agents, and consultants (collectively,  ‚ÄúPartners‚Äù). GitLab expects all Partners, their employees, sub-suppliers, and any other party involved in the execution of GitLab work to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and the standards set forth in GitLab‚Äôs\nPartner Code of Ethics\n, which includes standards relating to ethical conduct, including human rights and labor, health and safety, bribery and corruption, environmental impacts, and more.\nAppendix\nGRI disclosures\nSASB disclosures\nTCFD disclosures\nPerformance Data Tables\nContact\nFor questions regarding GitLab‚Äôs ESG report and data, please contact\nESG@GitLab.com\n.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

It is the inspiration for this company vision, which is on a\n10-year cadence\n.\nThe vision here is reflected in our company strategy, which is on a 3-year cadence. You can find additional product vision details on our\ndirection page\n.\nMonitoring an evolving market\nWhile we define our mission, vision, and strategy, we also acknowledge that we need to adapt with a changing market to meet customer needs. Netflix is a great example of this. Everyone knew that video on demand was the future. Netflix, however, started shipping DVDs over mail. They knew that it would get them a database of content that people would want to watch on demand. In other words, timing is everything.\nAdditionally, we must ensure that our Platform is open. If a new, better version control technology enters the market, we will need to integrate it into our platform, as it is one component in an integrated DevSecOps product.\nEntering new markets\nGitLab\nhas taken existing, fragmented software tooling markets, and by offering a consolidated offering instead, have created a new\nblue ocean\n. We would like to find more markets where we can repeat this same model.\nThe desirable characteristics of such markets fall into two stages: category consolidation and creation.\nCategory Consolidation\nA set of customer needs that are currently served by multiple, independent software tools.\nThose tools may already integrate with each other or have the possibility of integration.\nThose tools operate in categories that are typically considered discrete (for example, with GitLab, SCM was one market and CI was another).\nThere is no current ‚Äòwinner‚Äô at consolidating this market, even if there are some attempts to combine some of the tool categories within said market.\nUsers of the product are able to contribute to it ‚Äî for example, with GitLab, many users are software developers who can directly contribute code back to the product itself.\nWhen initially combined, the categories form a consistent and desirable user flow, which solves an overriding customer requirement.\nWe can offer a consolidated toolchain that is more cost effective for customers than purchasing, running, and integrating each tool separately.\nWe can do so profitably for the company.\nCategory Creation\nBy combining categories, a new overriding category, or market, gets created: the consolidated toolchain.\nThe sum of the categories combined should have desirable\n, such that entering the market means entering on a growth curve.\nNot all of the individual categories need to be on the upward curve of the\ntechnology adoption lifecycle\n(TAL). It is, however, necessary that there are enough future categories with high CAGR that are early in their adoption lifecycle.\nThe ideal overlap of the TALs is that the peaks of the curves are as close to each other as possible, so that when one TAL moves to Late Majority, the next TAL is still curving upwards. This allows it to provide an organic growth opportunity for the company in the markets it is entering.\nOur goal is to develop this model to be more quantifiable and formulaic, so that we can quickly and easily assess new opportunities.\nMitigating Concerns\nWe acknowledge the concerns to achieving our goals.

It‚Äôs important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.\nWe‚Äôre an\nall-remote\ncompany that allows people to work from\nalmost anywhere in the world\n. We hire great people regardless of where they live, but with GitLab team members across\nmore than 60 countries\n, it‚Äôs important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.\nTo accomplish this, we use\nasynchronous communication\nas a starting point\nand stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues,\nmerge requests\n, and\nSlack channels\n.\nWe also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down.\nWhen we go\nback and forth three times,\nwe jump on a\nsynchronous video call\n.\nWe communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.\nEffective & Responsible Communication Guidelines\nAssume\nPositive Intent\n.\nAlways begin with a position of positivity and grace.\nKindness Matters.\nYou are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn‚Äôt say it to a person‚Äôs face, do not send it to them in a text message.\nExpress Your Thoughts Responsibly and Inclusively.\nWe live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things. We also ask you to consider the guidelines around communicating potentially sensitive topics.\nOwn It.\nIf you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.\nBe a Role Model of our\nValues\n.\nFeedback is Essential.\nIt is difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members 60+ countries. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.\nDo not underestimate a 1:1.\nAsynchronous communication (e.g., via text) is helpful and necessary. In some cases (e.g., to clarify misunderstandings) it can be much more effective to jump on a Zoom video call.\nAlways Adhere to our\nAnti-Harassment Policy\nand\nGitLab Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n.\nEveryone should be comfortable in their work environment.\nFocus on what we can directly influence.\nThere are many factors we can‚Äôt directly influence and we should avoid spending time discussing those things. For example, we don‚Äôt talk about our\nmarket capitalization\nbecause aspects of this are out of our control. Instead, we should focus on how we can work together to achieve company objectives and grow\nannual recurring revenue\n.\nCommit to\nactive and effective listening\n.\nEmbracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm. Learn more about\nmastering the use of the written word in an all-remote setting\n.\nEveryone is a moderator\nIf you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format.\nIf there is an issue to raise regarding someone‚Äôs communication or conduct, team members should follow the process for\nraising communication concerns\nby sharing their concern with their manager or, if preferred, email Team Member Relations (\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n) directly.\nAsynchronous communication\nIn an\nall-remote setting\n, where team members are empowered to live and work where they‚Äôre most fulfilled, mastering asynchronous workflows is vital to avoiding\ndysfunction\nand enjoying outsized efficiencies and lifestyle flexibility. Asynchronous communication is the art of communicating and moving projects forward\nwithout\nthe need for additional stakeholders to be available at the same time your communique is sent.\nTo learn more on when to use asynchronous and synchronous communication, examples of async workflows in practice at GitLab, core async behaviors, and to take an async knowledge assessment, visit\nGitLab‚Äôs guide to embracing asynchronous communication\n.\nCommunicate directly\nWhen working on a problem or issue, communicate directly with the people you need support from rather than working through reporting lines. Direct communication with the people you need to collaborate with is more efficient than working through your manager, their manager, or another intermediary.\nEscalate to management if you are not getting the support you need. Remember that everyone is a\nmanager of one\nand they might have to complete their own assignments and inform the reporting lines.\nCommunicating Potentially GitLab Sensitive Topics\n(This guidance supplements and overlaps with\nGitLab‚Äôs SAFE Framework\n, the guidance on the use of\nthe internal handbook\nAs GitLab matures, we want to continue to foster discussion while evolving our communication guidelines so that topics that are potentially GitLab sensitive are discussed in appropriate forums. This is particularly relevant as team members heavily leverage async modes of communication including merge requests, issues and epics, and in Slack communication.\nWords have impact long after they are written, and even when you‚Äôre communicating internally, the manner in which you speak with one another should be viewed through an external lens. For additional information, please review our\nGuidelines for communicating effectively and responsibly through text\n.\nConfidentiality levels\nAt GitLab, we are\npublic by default\n, but some information is classified as internal or limited access. Please see the\nconfidentiality levels\nhandbook page for details on this.\nExamples of Potentially GitLab Sensitive Topics\nTeam member data (individual performance, start dates, departures)\nViolations, or potential violations, of policies and/or local rules and regulations\nCustomer or partner information (logos, trademarks, spend)\nMaterial nonpublic information\nThe above examples overlap with the\nGitLab‚Äôs SAFE Framework\nexamples. We recommend you to further review that page for more information and context.\nWhat are the risks?\nLegal risk:\nThese are the risks that arise from regulations and laws that govern GitLab or the market in which it operates. This includes, but is not limited to, content that would compromise a GitLab team member, customer, or user‚Äôs personal data and/or privacy.\nMorale risk:\nRaising GitLab sensitive topics that may be misinterpreted without the opportunity to ask clarifying questions can create risk to team culture and/or morale.\nPR risk:\nRemember that anything you document could ultimately be shared/viewed externally. Consider that a discussion in a public MR or issue is a demonstration of our\nvalues\nto those outside of GitLab who are looking to learn more about how we collaborate.\nWe encourage communicating risks to GitLab, its team members, or customers in a synchronous 1:1 setting.\nDetermining Which Communication Forum To Use\nThe table below outlines an overview of different communication forums at GitLab, and the considerations team members should think through related to potentially GitLab Sensitive topics when determining which forum to leverage.\nCommunication Forum\nWhen To Utilize\nUse\nthe internal Handbook\naligned with the guidelines\nWhen you want to document information for team members that is\ninternal-only\n, including\nnot public\nand not\nlimited access\nExternal MR/issue (not confidential)\nFor discussion and collaboration when there is no risk suspected or identified (directly or later) and it doesn‚Äôt fall into\nnot public\ncategory\nInternal MR/ confidential issue\nFor discussion and collaboration when there is no risk suspected or identified but adhering to things that are\ninternal-only\n,\nnot public\n, SAFE Framework/General Communication Guidelines\nYour Manager, DRI and/or Legal\nFor discussion and collaboration when in doubt about potential risk and you want to review if there‚Äôs a potential risk\nFor discussion and collaboration when there‚Äôs a risk suspected or identified, communicate directly with the DRI verbally via Zoom. Examples include issues where Limited Access applies or it covers a change to People Process/policy.\nPeople Group (your People Business Partner or Team Member Relations)\nFor discussion and collaboration when there‚Äôs a risk suspected or identified, a policy violation, and/or it‚Äôs a private matter\nGitLab‚Äôs Whistleblower policy\nFor flagging a situation that is a violation as set out in the policy\nWhen in doubt, you can reach out to your People Business Partner and/or your leadership team  directly.\nOrganization code names\nPlease see our\nProject names section\n.\nInternal communication\nInternal communication is any work related communication at a company.\nInternal Communication includes team member conversations, wider team discussions, or internal announcements to the company or targeted outreach to select internal audiences.\nAt GitLab, everyone can contribute to the effectiveness of Internal Communications to support aspects of GitLab culture, such as intentional transparency and engaging people in open dialogue.\nSince we believe that all team members must be\nManagers of One\n, most communication is handled by the relevant group, but we know that some communications are more sensitive and contentious than others.\nIn those cases, the DRIs may want to engage the\nInternal Communications function\n.\nTop tips and best practices\nAll written communication happens in English, even when sent one on one, because sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.\nUse\nasynchronous communication\nwhen possible: merge requests (preferred) or issues. Announcements happen on the appropriate Slack channels and people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat.\nDiscussion in issues or Merge Requests is preferred over everything else. If you need a response urgently, you can Slack someone with a link to your comment on an issue or merge request, asking them to respond there, however be aware that they still may not see it straight away. See\nSlack\nfor more.\nIf you choose to email instead of chat it is OK to send an\ninternal\nemail that contains only a short message, similar as you would use in chat.\nYou are not expected to be available all the time. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.\nSometimes synchronous communication is the better option, but do not default to it. For example, a video call can clear things up quickly when you are blocked. See the\nguidelines on video chats\nfor more detail.\nIt is OK to ask as many questions as you have. Please ask them so many people can answer them and so others can benefit from seeing the answer. Use issues or public chat channels (like\n#questions\n) instead of direct messages or one-on-one emails. If you have researched in the handbook and could not find the answer or need clarity, include the handbook link you were reviewing and state ‚Äúwhile looking in the handbook I could not find x,y,z‚Äù.\nIf you send a handbook link to someone as an answer to a question, consider adding some context, especially if they are new to GitLab. It‚Äôs great that we often have the answer documented, but it‚Äôs not always easy to find if you are a new team member.\nIf the answer to a question isn‚Äôt documented, please immediately make a merge request to add it to the handbook in a place you have looked for it. It is great for the person who answered the question to see you leading by example to ensure that question only needs to be answered once. A merge request is the best way to say thanks for help.\nIf you mention something (a merge request, issue, commit, webpage, comment, etc.) please include a link to it.\nAll company data should be\nshareable\nby default. Do not use a local text file, but rather leave comments on an issue.\nWhen someone asks something, give back a deadline or that you did it. Answers like: ‚Äòwill do‚Äô, ‚ÄòOK‚Äô, ‚Äòit is on my todo list‚Äô are not helpful. If it is small it‚Äôs better to spend 2 minutes and do the tasks so the other person can mentally forget about it. If it is large you need to figure out when you‚Äôll do it, by returning that information the other person might decide to solve it in another way if it takes too long.\nIt is OK to bring an issue to someone‚Äôs attention with a CC (‚Äúcc @user‚Äù), but CCs alone are not enough if specific action is needed from someone. The mentioned user may read the issue and take no further action. If you need something, please explicitly communicate your need along with @ mentioning who you need it from.\nAvoid creating private groups for internal discussions:\nIt‚Äôs disturbing (all users in the group get notified for each message).\nIt‚Äôs not searchable.\nIt‚Äôs not shareable: there is no way to add people in the group (and this often leads to multiple groups creation).\nThey don‚Äôt have a subject, so everyone has to remember the topic of each private group based on the participants, or open the group again to read the content.\nHistory is lost when leaving the group or\nafter 90 days\n.\nIt is perfectly fine to create a channel, even for a single customer meeting. These channels should be named ‚Äúa_\n-internal‚Äù to indicate their ‚Äúinternal‚Äù nature (not shared with customers).\nUse\nlow-context communications\nby being explicit in your communications. We are a remote-only company, located all over the world. Provide as much context as possible to avoid confusion. Relatedly, we use\nubiquitous language\nfor communication efficiency.\nWhen discussing concepts, be careful not to lean too much into hypotheticals. There is a tipping point in which it decreases value and no longer becomes constructive at helping everyone come into a unified decision.\nConsult our\ntips for better writing\n.\nInternal Communication Channel Guidance\nWhat/When\nThe Loop\nSlack\nEmail/Newsletters\nMeetings\nPrimary Purpose\nTransparency around GitLab procedures, documenting information handbook-first\nConnect team members with news, information, and stories\nReal-time collaboration and quick communications\nFormal communications, select company updates, and consolidated updates to targeted audiences\nSynchronous discussions and collaboration\nBest For\n1.)

Instead of assuming questions, aim to articulate key facts as statements and use these to structure content under topical headers which aren‚Äôt questions.\nStructured content around GitLab, the product, should be in\nGitLab Docs\nand structured content around GitLab, the company, should be in the handbook; we should not use separate documents or locations to share this information.\nRestructuring the content\nAs an example, let‚Äôs say your FAQ would have a question like:\nQ: I‚Äôm not seeing widget X, what should I do?\nA: If you‚Äôre not seeing widget X, you can verify if it‚Äôs enabled or not by going to User Profile -> Settings and ensure the checkbox is enabled under Enable widget X\nYou can reframe it to:\nHow to enable widget X\nYou can enable widget X by going to User Profile -> Settings and ticking the checkbox next to Enable widget X then clicking on the Save button\nFAQs are discouraged elsewhere as well\nContent guidelines across the industry support avoiding FAQs:\nhttps://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/web/avoid-faqs/\nhttps://digital.gov/2015/04/27/are-faqs-still-relevant/\nhttps://guides.18f.gov/content-guide/our-approach/structure-the-content/\nhttps://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/25/faqs-why-we-dont-have-them/\nhttps://thegood.com/insights/faq-pages/\nhttps://alistapart.com/article/no-more-faqs-create-purposeful-information-for-a-more-effective-user-experi/\nMultimodal communication\nEmploy multimodal communication to broadcast important decisions. To reach our distributed organization, announce important decisions in the company announcements Slack channel, email the appropriate team email lists, Slack the appropriate channels, and target 1:1s or other important meetings on the same day, with the same information.\nWhen doing this, create and link to a\nsingle source of truth\n: ideally the\nhandbook\n, otherwise an epic, issue, or Google Doc. The email or Slack message should not be the source of truth.\nWhen referring to email that recipients should have received, reference the sender and subject of the email so it‚Äôs easy to find. For example, ‚ÄúYou should have received an email from Jane Smith with the subject ‚ÄòTraining Seminar Details‚Äô‚Äù.\nAsking ‚Äúis this known‚Äù\nIf something is behaving strangely on\nhttps://gitlab.com\n, it might be a bug. It could also mean that something was changed intentionally.\nPlease search if the issue has already\nbeen reported\n. If it has not been reported, and you are sure it is a bug, please\nfile an issue\n.\nIf you are unsure whether the behavior you experience is a bug, you may ask in the Slack channel\n#is-this-known\n.\nIf you know which stage of the DevOps lifecycle is affected, it is also okay to ask in #s_{stage}, for example\n#s_manage\n.\nWhen you ask:\nMake sure that no-one has experienced this issue before, by checking the channel for previous messages.\nDescribe the behavior you are experiencing, this makes it searchable and easier to understand.\nDifferent people might look for different things in the same screenshots.\nAsking in a single channel helps discoverability, duplicated efforts and reduces noise in other channels.\nPlease refrain from asking in general purpose channels like\n#frontend\n,\n#backend\n,\n#development\nor\n#questions\n.\nNumbering is for reference, not as a signal\nWhen taking notes in an agenda, in the handbook, or in other documents, keep items numbered so we can refer to Item 3 or 4a.\nThe number is not a signal of the importance or rank of the subject unless explicitly stated to be such.\nIt is just for ease of reference.\nCross link\nLinking should not be in one direction. We should go beyond deep-linking to create a richer web of links that can surface content and ensure people consider all pages when making updates. When linking one page to another, try to link back as well. Instead of only linking from Page A to Page B, both link Page A to Page B and link Page B back to Page A. For example, the\nLive Doc Meeting\nsection of the All Remote Guide links to the\nLive Docs Meetings page\n. The\nLive Docs Meetings page\nlinks back to the\nLive Doc Meeting\nsection of the All Remote Guide.\nAcknowledgement Receipts (ACK)\nInformal ACKs\nIn informal acknowledgement scenarios, such as on Slack or on issue comments, it is common practice to use the following:\nSlack emoji reaction of\n:ack:\nor an\nresponse => Acknowledged, or message received\nThumbs up üëç => good idea\nWhite checkmark ‚úÖ => task is complete or done\nHeart ‚ù§ Ô∏è= expression of gratitude or appreciation\ncc @mentions => if someone needs to see a message\nFormal ACKs\nIn order to effectively communicate an important change to hundreds of distributed employees, we occasionally use an ACK process.\nTo prevent overuse, this should only be used by a member of the exec team. Anyone may ask an exec to sponsor one.\nAs a guideline, we‚Äôd expect no more than one per quarter to be sent out. Too many ACKs lose power.\nTo initiate an ACK process:\nClone the form from the\nACK template\nand fill it out.\nLink to MRs and Handbook pages instead of duplicating your content in the form.\nWhy handbook first?\nAsk People Ops to pull a report from Workday with the column headers First Name, Last Name, Job Title, Department, Manager, and Work Email. Double check it and turn the emails into a comma-delimited string with an excel formula like this:\n=TEXTJOIN(\", \", true, Sheet1!E2:E432)\nSend the form and expect to get 50% of the responses in the first 24 hours. To get the rest:\nPost in common Slack channels.\nAdd to staff meeting agendas.\nSuggest to team managers to post to their team Slack channels, ask for explicit\n:ack:\nand pin to the channel until everyone responds.\nLastly, reach out 1-on-1 to stragglers while being respectful of vacation time.\nSay thanks\nAs we continue to build on\ninclusion\n, recognition is a key and transformative tactic. Thanking team members provides an opportunity for them to be recognized for their contributions, influences engagement behavior, and acknowledges to team members their work is seen. By saying thanks, you are contributing to and supporting the value of\n.\nThank people that did a great job in our\n#thanks\nSlack channel. Almost\neveryone in the company is active in this channel\nso please don‚Äôt be shy.\nConsider other channels where recognition can be acknowledged: team meetings, issues, company calls, 1-1 meetings, etc.\nIf someone is a team member just\n@\n-mention them, if multiple people were working on something try\n@\n-mentioning each person.\nWhen announcing a completed project, list the key contributors.\nPlease be as timely as possible with your recognition.\nIf possible please include a link with your thanks that points to the subject matter that you are giving thanks for, for example a link to a merge request.\nPlease do not mention working outside of working hours, we want to minimize the pressure to do so.\nPlease do not celebrate GitLab contribution graphs that include working for uninterrupted weeklong cycles, as this does not foster healthy\nwork/life harmony\nfor all team members. While GitLab team members are free to time-shift and work weekends in place of weekdays, we discourage celebrating the absence of time away from work.\nDo not thank the CEO or other executives for something that the company paid for, thank GitLab instead.\nTo thank someone who is not a team member, you can\nnominate them for community swag\n.\nUnderstand that everyone doesn‚Äôt need or want recognition. Once this is advised, please respect when they don‚Äôt.\nValues emoji\nAdd Values emoji reactions to thank you messages in the\n#thanks\nslack channel\nor feel free to use them in GitLab.com, other slack channels and\nsocial media, when you see alignment to our values:\nGitLab‚Äôs values\n.\nEmoji\nCustom values emoji\nMeaning\n:handshake:\n:collaboration-value:\nCollaboration\n:chart_with_upwards_trend:\n:results-value:\nResults for Customers\n:stopwatch:\n:efficiency-value:\nEfficiency\n:globe_with_meridians:\n:diversity-value:\nDiversity Inclusion and Belonging\n:footprints:\n:iteration-value:\nIteration\n:eye:\n:transparency-value:\nTransparency\nAs a second iteration, we have\nadded these custom emoji to GitLab\nto enable tanuki values reactions in issues, epics, and MRs within the\ngitlab-com\nand\ngitlab-org\ngroups.\nAs a later iteration, we will begin tracking the number of emoji reactions for each value through the Reacji API and update this page with our findings!\nIndicating availability\nIndicate your availability by updating your own calendar using Google‚Äôs\n‚Äúout of office‚Äù\nfeature and include the dates you plan to be away in your automated response. Note that this feature will automatically decline any meeting invitations during the time frame you select.\nPut your planned away time including holidays, vacation, travel time, and other leave in your own calendar. Please see\nCommunicating your time off\nfor more.\nSet your working hours in your Google Calendar settings.\nUtilize Time Off by Deel to keep other GitLab team members aware of your\nplanned time away\nwithin Slack.\nInformal communication\nis made up of interactions between co-workers that are unofficial in nature and focus on building social relationships outside of the normal hierarchy of a typical business structure.\nIn other words, it‚Äôs what happens when we get to know each other and talk about anything other than work.\nInformal communication is a\nvital part of GitLab culture\n, and we‚Äôve listed\n20+ ways to engage\n.\nNot sure where to go?\nIf there is something that you want to discuss, but you do not feel that it is\na reasonable option to discuss with either your manager or CEO, then you can reach\nout to any of the other\nC-level GitLab team members\n.\nStart with a Merge Request\nWhen possible, it‚Äôs best practice to start a discussion with a\nMerge Request (MR)\ninstead of an issue. An MR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss. The nature of MRs facilitate discussions around a proposed solution to a problem that is actionable. An MR is actionable, while an issue will take longer to take action on.\nAlways\nopen\nan MR for things you are suggesting and/or proposing. Whether something is not working right or we are iterating on a new internal process, it is worth opening a merge request with the minimal valuable change instead of opening an issue encouraging open feedback on the problem without proposing any specific change directly. Remember, an MR also invites discussion, but it‚Äôs specific to the proposed change which facilitates focused decision.\nNever ask someone to create an issue when they can default to the merge request.\nStarting with a Merge Request is part of\nHandbook First\nand helps ensure the handbook is up-to-date when a decision is made. It is also how we make it possible for\nEveryone to Contribute\n. This is true, not just for updating the handbook but for updating all things.\nMerge Requests, by default, are\nnon-confidential\n. However, for\nthings that are not public by default\nplease open a confidential issue with suggestions to specific changes that you are proposing. The ability to create\nConfidential Merge Requests\nis also available. When possible, consider not including sensitive information so the wider community can contribute.\nNot every solution will solve the problem at hand. Keep discussions focused by\ndefining the problem first\nand\nexplaining your rationale\nbehind the\nMinimal Valuable Change (MVC)\nproposed in the MR.\nBe proactive and consistent with communication on discussions that have external stakeholders such as customers. It‚Äôs important to keep communication flowing to keep everyone up to date. MRs can appear stale if there aren‚Äôt recent discussions and no clear definition on when another update will be provided, based on feedback. This leaves those subscribed in the dark, causing unnecessary surprise if something ends up delayed and suddenly jumps to the next milestone. It is important that MRs are closed in a timely manner through approving or rejecting the open requests.\nHave a\nbias for action\nand\ndo not aim for consensus\n. Every MR is a\nproposal\n, if an MRs author isn‚Äôt responsive take ownership of it and complete it. Some improvement is better than none.\nCross link\nissues or other MRs with related conversations. E.g. if there‚Äôs a Zendesk ticket that caused you to create a GitLab.com MR, make sure to document the MR link in the Zendesk ticket and vice versa. And when approving or rejecting the MR, include reason or response from Zendesk. Put the link at the top of each MR‚Äôs description with a short mention of the relationship (Report, Dependency, etc.) and use one as the central one and ideally close the alternate if duplicate.\nWhen providing links to specific lines of code relevant to the MR,\nalways use a permalink\n(a link to a specific commit for the file). This ensures that the reference is still valid if the file changes. For more information, see\nLink to specific lines of code\n.\nIf submitting a change for a feature,\nupdate the description with the final conclusions\n(Why an MR was rejected or why it was approved). This makes it much easier to see the current state of an issue for everyone involved in the implementation and prevents confusion and discussion later on.\nSubmit the\nsmallest\nviable and valuable thing\n. When proposing a change, submit the smallest reasonable commit, put suggestions for other enhancements in separate issues/MRs and link them. An MR can start off as only a\nproblem description and TODO comments\n. If you‚Äôre new to GitLab and are writing documentation or instructions, submit your first merge request for at most 20 lines.\nDo not leave MRs open for a long time. MRs should be\nactionable\n‚Äì stakeholders should have a clear understanding of what changed and what they are ultimately approving or rejecting.\nMake a conscious effort to\nprioritize\nyour work. The priority of items depends on multiple factors: Is someone waiting for the answer? What is the impact if you delay it? How many people does it affect, etc.? This is detailed in\nEngineering Work flow\n.\nWhen submitting a MVC,\nask for feedback\nfrom your peers. For example, if you‚Äôre a designer and you propose a design, ping a fellow designer to review your work. If they suggest changes, you get the opportunity to improve your design and propose an alternative MR. This promotes collaboration and advances everyone‚Äôs skills.\nRespond to comments within a\nthreaded discussion\n. If there isn‚Äôt a discussion thread yet, you can use the\nReply to comment\nbutton from the comments to create one. This will prevent comments from containing many interweaved discussions with responses that are hard to follow.\nIf your comment or answer contains separate topics, write separate comments for each, so others can address topics independently using the\nReply to comment\nbutton.\nIf you have received any feedback or questions on your MR, try to acknowledge comments as\nthat‚Äôs how we ensure we create an environment of belonging for all team members\n. Merging your MR as-is without giving an answer or any response makes the commenters feel their opinions are unheard. If you are the\nDirectly Responsible Individual\n(DRI) who does not have to make a fast decision, you can choose not to change your MR, but you should acknowledge the comments or feedback, consider if they warrant a change to your MR, and\nsay why, not just what\n.\nIf there are many comments, you can choose to summarize key feedback areas and share your response at a high level. We appreciate that\nif you force a DRI to explain too much, you‚Äôll create incentives to ship projects under the radar. The fear of falling into a perpetual loop of explaining can derail a DRI, and cause people to defer rather than working with a bias for action\n. This is something we want to avoid.\nWhen fast decisions are needed,\nwe‚Äôll have to accept that people listened to us but don‚Äôt owe us an explanation to have fast decisions based on everyone‚Äôs input\n. The goals are to be transparent and collaborative‚Äìnot to lose efficiency. Not everyone will agree, but we expect all people to\ndisagree, commit, and disagree\n.\nFor GitLab, the product merge request guidelines are in the\nContribution guide\nand code review guidelines for reviewers and maintainers are described in our\nCode Review Guidelines\n.\nEven when something is not done, share it internally so people can comment early and prevent rework.\nCreate a\nDraft\nmerge request to prevent an accidental early merge. Only use Draft when merging it would\nmake things worse\n, which should rarely be the case when contributing to the handbook. Most merge requests that are in progress don‚Äôt make things worse. In this case, do not use Draft; if someone merges it earlier than you expected just create a new merge request for additional items. Never ask someone to do a final review or merge something that still has Draft status. At that point you should be convinced it is good enough to go out.\nIf any follow-up actions are required on the issue after the merge request is merged (like reporting back to any customers or writing documentation), avoid auto-closing the issue.\nIf a project requires multiple approvals to accept your MR, feel free to assign multiple reviewers concurrently. This way the earliest available reviewer can start right away rather than being blocked by the preceding reviewer.\nIf the MR involved gets a lot of comments, you can turn it into a\nManager Mention MR\n.\nConsider recording a concise video or audio file outlining the merge request and uploading it to the GitLab\nUnfiltered channel\non YouTube. This will make content more accessible, prevent future confusion, allow for multitasking (e.g. cooking dinner and listening to the video), and increase participation for folks who digest audio information better than visual.\nScaling Merge Requests through ‚ÄúManager Mention MRs‚Äù (formerly Consolidated MRs)\nSome merge requests that involve a big decision or change tend to collect a large amount of feedback. As GitLab grows in size, it is unrealistic for a single person to respond to potentially hundreds of comments. To remain efficient in these MRs and to make it scalable, it is important for the DRI to receive a clear signal of input that is shared on the merge request. Some MRs may be marked as ‚ÄúManager Mention MRs‚Äù by clearly designating them as such at the beginning of the MR description with the following code block:\n### Manager Mention MR\nThis MR is a [Manager Mention MR](/handbook/communication/#scaling-merge-requests-through-manager-mention-mrs-formerly-consolidated-mrs). Contributors should tag their manager when adding a comment. If managers are tagged they should either respond to the question or summarize and tag their manager.\nAdditionally, add the\n~\"Manager Mention MR\"\nlabel to the merge request. This will make future analytics on Manager Mention merge requests more easily identifiable. It also enables managers to subscribe to the label to be notified when an MR has elected the Manager Mention MR designation.\nWe tried Manager Mention MR‚Äôs for the first time in a recent announcement (2021-03-03) but this did not work well and we are working on making it better. We‚Äôre starting with a more thoughtful and transparent process in our communications cadence and approach going forward, including all directs and people managers getting a few days‚Äô notice before important company-wide changes are announced to all team members. This will allow all directs and people managers to feel more enabled and better understand the why behind big changes in order to scale communication to team members.\nFor all managers:\nIt is important to ground yourself in the contents of the changes before the announcement goes live to all team members. If a team member tags you in a Manager Mention MR, it is your role to respond candidly and thoughtfully to their question or comment. If the line of questioning in the Manager Mention MR gets out of your depth, ask the DRI to help answer. If a team member comments without a manager tagged, the comment will be closed with a link to this handbook section or closed without comment. In a situation where a team member leaves a wildly inappropriate comment in the Manager Mention MR, you should feel empowered to delete comment and talk to your team member 1:1. Consider subscribing to the label\n~\"Manager Mention MR\"\nto be notified when MRs transition to this designation.\nWhat not to do:\nNot communicate to team members about company-wide changes. Ignoring team member questions, whether that‚Äôs in a 1:1 or Manager Mention MR.\nWhat to do:\nIf one of your team members has a suggestion, solution or sees an issue, see if talking through the communication will answer any of their questions. Team members are also allowed to bring forward their ideas in the Manager Mention MR addressed to you, we want everyone to contribute. As a manager, you will be expected to communicate changes to your teams and also be present to answer any team member questions, whether that‚Äôs in a 1:1 or Manager Mention MR. As a manager, it is part of your role to understand and own change management for your team and properly triage the process and expectations. Consider a synchronous call with the team member for further context, make a suggestion, link to additional context, delete any unnecessary comments from their team, or escalate to the author of the MR. Ensure that the comments of your reports you interact with were made after the Manager Mention label was added.\nFor team members:\nCheck if the MR you are about to comment on has the\n~\"Manager Mention MR\"\nlabel. Check each time as the label may have been added since you last commented. When leaving a comment in a Manager Mention MR, frame the comment as a question or suggestion to your manager directly, and not anyone else, including the DRI. We do this to scale communication, as it is unsustainable for the DRI to answer every question.\nWhat not to do:\nLeaving a comment and CC‚Äôing your manager at the end of your post, but not addressing your manager directly.\nWhat to do:\nAddress your manager directly at the beginning of your message as your comments should be addressed to your manager. If you have a suggestion, solution or see an issue with a big change, you can also bring it up directly to your manager. The MR is not a poll. Give suggestions on how to improve and try to find data that helps support your argument or change in the MR.\nMRs should not start out as a Manager Mention MR as we prefer\ncommunication to be direct\n. They should only be designated as such after the number of comments on them grows to a level that is unsustainable for the DRI. An exception to this is compensation changes and other company-wide announcements that can be sensitive/contentious in nature since they have historically generated many comments.\nWhen an MR is changed to be\nManager Mention\n, the person making this change should add a comment stating this so that everyone tracking the MR can be informed.\nIssues\nIssues are valuable when there isn‚Äôt a specific code change that is being proposed, such as:\nCrafting a research proposal to validate a problem or solution\nIdeating on designs in order to solve a particular problem\nBreaking down implementation tasks in order to deliver a solution iteratively\nTracking progress of particular tasks, especially when an issue board is needed\nWhen utilizing issues, it is still important to maintain focus by defining a single specific topic of discussion and the desired outcome that would result in the resolution of the issue. Issues should not be open-ended or go stale due to lack of resolution. For example, a team member may open an issue to track the progress of a blog post with associated to-do items that need to be completed by a certain date (e.g. first draft, peer review, publish). Once the specific items are completed, the issue can successfully be closed.\nBelow are a few things to remember when creating issues:\nWhen\nclosing\nan issue leave a comment explaining why you are closing the issue and what the MVC outcome was of the discussion (if it was implemented or not).\nWe keep our\npromises\nand do not make external promises without internal agreement.\nBe proactive and consistent with communication on discussions that have external stakeholders such as customers. It‚Äôs important to keep communication flowing to keep everyone up to date. Issues can appear stale if there aren‚Äôt recent discussions and no clear definition on when another update will be provided, based on feedback. This leaves those subscribed in the dark, causing unnecessary surprise if something ends up delayed and suddenly jumps to the next milestone. It is important that issues are closed in a timely manner. One way of doing this is having the current assignee set a due date for when they will provide another update. This can be days or weeks ahead depending on the situation, prioritization, and available capacity that we may have.\nPro Tip:\nWhen creating a Merge Request you can add\ncloses: #[insert issue number here]\nand when the Merge Request is merged, the issue will automatically close. You can see an example of this\nhere\n.\nNote:\nAutomatic issue closing\nis disabled on some projects.\nIf a user suggests an enhancement, try and find an existing issue that addresses their concern, or create a new one. Ask if they‚Äôd like to elaborate on their idea in an issue to help define the first MVC via a subsequent MR.\nCross link\nissues or MRs with related conversations. Another example is to add ‚ÄúReport: \" lines to the issue description with links to relevant issues and feature requests. When done, add a comment to relevant issues (and close them if you are responsible for reporting back, or reassign if you are not). This prevents internal confusion and us failing to report back to the reporters.\nWhen cross-linking issues or MRs, include a preview of the content you are linking, to facilitate\nlow-context communication\n:\nGood:\nthis would cause performance issue similar to #123456\n. The reader has full information on first read and can refer to the link for more.\nAvoid:\nthis would cause issue similar to #123456\n. The reader needs to click the link and find the relevant information among other discussion threads, before switching back to the original discussion.\nWhen providing links to specific lines of code relevant to the issue,\nalways use a permalink\n(a link to a specific commit for the file). This ensures that the reference is still valid if the file changes. For more information, see\nLink to specific lines of code\n.\nPrioritize your work on issues in the current\nmilestone\n.\nUse the public issue trackers on GitLab.com for everything since\nwe work out in the open\n. Issue trackers that can be found on the relevant page in the handbook and in the projects under\nthe gitlab-com group\n.\nAssign an issue to yourself as soon as you start to work on it, but not before that time. If you complete part of an issue and need someone else to take the next step,\nre-assign\nthe issue to that person.\nEnsure the issue\ntitle\nstates what the desired outcome should be. For instance, for bugs make sure the issue states the desired result, not the current behavior.\nRegularly update\nthe issue description with the latest information and its current status, especially when important decisions were made during the discussion. The issue description should be the\nsingle source of truth\n.\nIf you want someone to review an issue, do not assign them to it. Instead, @-mention them in an issue comment. Being assigned to an issue is a signal that the assignee should or intends to work on it. So you should not assign someone to an issue and misrepresent this with a false signal.\nIf you‚Äôd like to inform someone about an issue or assign a task to them, do so via an issue comment, not only by adding them to the description. The to-do item generated when you mention someone in an issue description provides little context for the action you‚Äôre requesting. But using a comment to explicitly inform someone of the action you‚Äôd like them to take ensures that when they read the associated to-do item they won‚Äôt need to read the entire issue to gather the context they need to complete the work.\nDo not close an issue until it is\ndone\n. It‚Äôs okay to explicitly ask if everyone is on board and in agreement on how to move forward, whether to iterate, close the open issue, or create a subsequent MR to implement a MVC.\nOnce a feature is\ndone\n, update the description to add a link to the corresponding documentation. When using a Search Engine, issues often appear before documentation pages, which makes it harder to find the relevant information about the feature.\nWrite issues so that they exclude private information. This way, the issue can be public. Only use confidential issues, if the issue must contain\nnon-public information\n.\nNote:\nConfidential issues are\naccessible to all members of the project with Reporter access and above\n. You may consider using a Google Doc for items that require a stricter level of confidentiality.\nIf the content within a public issue transitions to become what is deemed confidential\nnon-public information\n, the issue may be made confidential.\nIf the content of a public issue draws comments that are deemed in violation of our\ncode of conduct\nthe issue may be locked and may\nundergo moderation\n.\nHow to make a company wide announcement\nConsider the subject and the audience.\nQuestions you might want to ask yourself: Is this relevant to all team members globally?\nIs this something important, urgent and high priority? Is there a better place for this communication, such as a more informal Slack channel?\nKeep it simple, brief and summarize what is important. Cover the 5 W‚Äôs. What, Why, Who, When, Where (you can also add How, if required as a call to action). The majority of information should still be in the Handbook which you include links to.\nCommon company wide announcements include (but are not limited to): organization changes, policy iterations, requests to participate in a company survey, unveiling the next GitLab Contribute location, codebase migrations, process improvement and security/safety announcements.\nRemember Handbook First.\nWhen you announce anything, include links to the respective Handbook pages for more information. Consider adding link to an Issue if the information is not public yet.\nOptional AMA.\nIf desired and appropriate, offer a company wide Zoom call to host an AMA (Ask Me Anything). Oftentimes, questions can be managed within the Discussion tab of a GitLab Issue or Merge Request. For broad announcements, such as registration opening for GitLab Contribute, an AMA may be better suited for a large volume of inquiries. To schedule a company wide call, please make a request in the\n#people-connect\nSlack channel, and include a Google Doc in the invite for questions.\nRemember we are a global company with significant time-zone differences. Unless there is a reason to do otherwise, ensure any time-sensitive calls to action or announcements are made when the whole company has enough time to action. Consider different timezones, non-linear work days, and PTO. Announcements should be made ideally 72 hours (at minimum 24 hours) in advance of a due date. This is to prevent APAC/EMEA team members missing important announcements posted outside their normal working hours.\nSometimes a late announcement is better than none at all, and acknowledging those who will miss it might be a kind gesture, such as ‚ÄúApologies to our APAC/EMEA friends for the late notice‚Äù.\nPosting in #company-fyi\nOur company-wide announcements channel is\n#company-fyi\n.\nIt is an\nannouncement only\nchannel, meaning that communications need to be approved before they can be posted. To minimize noise, announcements made in\n#company-fyi\nshould not be duplicated in\n#whats-happening-at-gitlab\n. Be mindful of the\nattention economy\n.\nIn order to post or have a message posted in\n#company-fyi\n, please reach out to\nthe internal communications team\nor your function‚Äôs executive who can approve the message and post it.\nExamples of what\nshould not\ngo in\n#company-fyi\n(as per new group guidelines):\nCompetition prize winner announcements\nOrg change or new team member announcements (unless they are E-group)\nPromotion of an optional non-company-wide internal event\nAnnouncement that directly impacts less than 75% of team members\nActions required from team members is not critical or timely\nThe above should all go in the new #whats-happening-at-GitLab channel\n(formerly the\n#company-announcement\nchannel).\ngraph TB\neverybody{{\"Do you want to reach the entire company?\"}}\nimportant{{\"How important is it?\"}}\npermission{{\"Do you have permission<br>\nto post in #company-fyi?\"}}\nurgent{{\"Is it urgent?\"}}\nreconsider{{\"Are you sure you can't reach the people you need by posting in topic channels?\"}}\nchannel-important>\"Post in #company-fyi\"]\nchannel-important-ask>\"Ask your function's executive<br>\nto post in #company-fyi\"]\nchannel-general>\"Post in #whats-happening-at-gitlab\"]\nchannel-topic>\"Post in the most topical channel\"]\nrepost([\"Repost in the 1-2 most appropriate channel(s) based on your topic/audience\"])\nno-repost([\"Do not repost\"])\nclassDef question fill: #ECECFF\nclass everybody,important,permission,urgent,reconsider question;\nclassDef action fill: #a2f2a9\nclass channel-important,channel-important-ask,channel-general,channel-topic,repost,no-repost action;\nclassDef repost fill: #f2d3a2\nclass repost,no-repost repost;\neverybody -- Yes --> important\neverybody -- No  --> channel-topic\nimportant -- need-to-know --> permission\nimportant -- good-to-know --> reconsider\npermission -- Yes --> channel-important\npermission -- No  --> urgent\nreconsider -- Yes --> channel-general\nreconsider -- No --> channel-topic\nurgent -- No  --> channel-important-ask\nurgent -- Yes --> channel-general\nchannel-topic --> repost\nchannel-general --> repost\nchannel-important --> no-repost\nchannel-important-ask --> no-repost\nPosting in #whats-happening-at-gitlab\nDue to the volume of posts in the Slack channel, we recommend that you do not use #whats-happening-at-gitlab as a sole location for important announcements as information might get lost or muted. Examples of important items include but are not limited to:\nAnything involving GitLab team member policy, such as changes in benefits, laws, review cycles, etc.\nUrgent matters that can‚Äôt wait for #company-fyi but still need to be communicated to everyone such as service outages or last minute event changes\nMeetings\nCommon meeting problems\nMeetings are incredibly expensive since they require synchronous time.\nThe most common meeting problems can all be addressed by following the above guidelines around scheduling meetings.\nSome of the most common meetings problems are outlined below:\nProblem\nSolution\nPresent instead of Q&A\nPre-record presentations on YouTube, so meetings are only Q&A\nMeetings set up for or default to brainstorming\nPeople should default to making thoughtful proposals async and building upon them in meetings, if needed\nNo agenda with edit rights for everyone\nEnsure that every meeting has an agenda and is available for everyone to edit\nPeople are late to meetings or don‚Äôt have time to use the restroom between meetings\nUse Speedy Meetings to give people breathing space before their next meeting\nEveryone is responsible for notes\nIf folks are involved in a meeting and have capacity to do so, they should take notes using GitLab‚Äôs\nLive Doc Meetings principles\n. This is important, because:\nMeetings at GitLab should have notes (for a single source of truth and to enable async participation among other reasons)\nIn the absence of this joint commitment to note-taking, this is the type of work that is likely to fall disproportionately to\nunderrepresented groups\n. This is not in line with our\ndiversity, inclusion, and belonging value\n.\nIt may look like a few people are already taking notes, do not see this as a deterrent for helping. Initial note takers may be first to show up and then see it as their responsibility to continue if no one else is stepping in.\nWhile meetings recordings are helpful, written notes are more efficient to read and offer greater opportunities for async engagement. Takes notes even when a meeting is being recorded.\nEngaging EBAs in note-taking\nGitLab Executive Business Administrators\nsometimes support teams by taking notes. Since note taking takes time away from their other activities and can often be done by other folks, consider the following before engaging an EBA in a meeting solely for note taking purposes.\nCan the folks already in this meeting cover note taking responsibilities, or is there a reason to engage an EBA in this capacity?\nCan other folks be identified ahead of time or at the start of the meeting to ensure adequate coverage?\nHow does this stack against the EBAs other priorities? You can check directly with the EBA or their manager.\nSmart note taking in meetings\nNote taking helps us to work asynchronously. Team members can add thoughts to an agenda in advance of a meeting and understand what was discussed if they cannot attend. It also offers a record of discussion.\nConsider the following best practice when taking notes in meetings:\nIf at the start of the meeting, it does not look like all team members will contribute to note-taking, identify a set of note-takers who will be responsible for this activity within the meeting\nUtilize Zoom‚Äôs AI Companion to create and/or share a meeting summary. Meeting Summary with Zoom AI Companion uses AI technology, which may include third-party models, and allows meeting hosts to initiate an AI-generated summary of their meeting. When the host enables this feature in a meeting, participants may automatically receive a summary after the meeting ends, if the host chose to share it with them.\nNote-taking can be a lot for a single person to stay on top of‚Äìespecially when there is a fast moving conversation with many speakers. Team members should still feel empowered to contribute by helping with notes as needed, even if there is someone assigned.\nAnother good reference is the CEO Shadow\nhandbook page tips section\n, specifically\nIt's helpful if shadow one takes notes as the first speaker is talking, then shadow two starts when the next speaker continues the conversation. Shadow one can pick up note taking again when the next speaker contributes. By alternating this way, the shadows are better able to keep up with all the participants in the conversation.\nThis advice can be used in general meetings as well.\nAsk others to scribe answers in real-time to allow the person who asked the question to focus on the answer. Touch up the answer when the conversation has moved on to something less relevant.\nIt can be hard to keep up with the dialog and capture quality notes when there‚Äôs fast back and forth conversation. Lead by example and write when you‚Äôre not talking, expect others will write when you‚Äôre talking.\nFocus on noting speakers and their key points over capturing all words said. Extensive note-taking should not happen at the expense of correct note-taking.\nWrite down your questions\nin the agenda before vocalizing. Always ask people to vocalize their questions to provide the most detailed context and for audio-only playbacks.\nUse discretion in taking notes if sensitive topics are being discussed. For example, do not takes notes on\nnot-public information\nif the agenda may be available to an audience who should not be privy to this information.\nIf someone requests folks to stop taking notes, stop for the duration of the discussion unless there is verbal confirmation that note-taking should resume. Ask for the confirmation before typing before you resume note-taking.\nAt the end of the meeting, clearly capture key takeaways, next steps, and\nDRIs\n.\nIf you have any questions about what may or may not be a sensitive topic, please refer to our SAFE Framework or reach out via the\n#safe\nSlack channel\nFew meetings with presentations\nPresenting\nduring meetings requires valuable synchronous time. Instead, recorded presentations make content accessible, prevent confusion, and increase participation for team members that prefer consuming content\nasynchronously\n. Remember it is not required to have a presentation or have a pre-recorded presentation.\nIn the video below, GitLab co-founder, Sid Sijbrandij, explains why there are no presentations in most meetings.\nPre-recorded presentations enable:\nAllows time for Q&A, which enables attendees to have their questions answered without running out of time.\nReinforces GitLab‚Äôs\nBias Towards Asynchronous Communication\nbecause it allows a distributed team to consume the presentation asynchronously.\nStrengthens\nself-service and self-learning\nby maximizing the meeting time‚Äôs efficiency to ensure that team members have their voices heard during the Q&A.\nStandardizes the approach to meetings across the organization.\nIncludes transcripts that can boost content value, help team members focus, and increase accessibility.\nFlexibility in viewing using rewind and playback speed adjustments.\nEncourages and enables greater participation from\nneurodiverse team members\nwho might take added time to process and reflect before asking questions.\nAllows for selective watching of presentation material for a certain period.\nThere are times when presenting during a meeting is needed. This may occur when adding more context to a specific topic on slides. If this is the case, consider the following:\nA presentation, with optional attendance and mandatory recording. This will allow clarifying questions to be asked and answered efficiently and enables team members to watch async.\nInclude an async Q&A doc for team members who did not attend the presentation.\nEnsure the async Q&A doc is linked in the YouTube description.\nBest Practices for Pre-Recorded Presentations\nUse Zoom to create a pre-recorded video presentation.\nPost the recording to the GitLab\nUnfiltered YouTube channel\nand attach it to the meeting agenda.\nAt least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, announce in Slack Channels that the meeting has a pre-recorded video, and all attendees are advised to watch beforehand.\nFramework for meetings with presentations\nWhile most meetings should not have presentations, there are a few exceptions. Specifically, we may use synchronous touch points in meetings with large numbers of folks. These tend to be meetings used for building team cohesion and alignment. For example,\nGitLab Assembly\nor the\nFunctional Leaders Meeting\n.\nGitLab has the following meeting framework for determining which meetings should have presentations:\nPresentation Approach\nTypes of meetings with few participants\nTypes of meetings with many participants\nNo presentations (async prep)\nMost meetings\nPresentations\nThese meetings should not happen\nAssembly\nand other large team meetings\nMeeting introduction guidelines\nIntroductions can be helpful during some external meetings, such as executive sales calls. In those meetings, use these guidelines:\nAgree ahead of time to do introductions so everyone is prepared for it.\nCreate a list of people with their roles in a shared agenda and use that for the introduction sequence.\nEach person should introduce themselves so that everyone can see that person on Zoom.\nThe person introducing themselves hands it over to the next person in the agenda.\nMake sure you‚Äôre never screen sharing when people are introducing themselves.\nScheduling meetings\nEvery scheduled meeting should either have a Google Presentation (for example for functional updates that don‚Äôt require participation) or a Google Doc (for most meetings) linked. If it is a Google Doc it should have an\nagenda\n, including any preparation materials (can be a presentation). For a step-by-step guide on GitLab meeting best practices, visit our\nLive Doc Meetings page\n.\nNo agenda is required for\ncoffee chats\n. Note that only meetings that are primarily social in nature should be labeled as a coffee chat in the calendar invite.\nA suggested format for 1:1 agendas can be found on the\n1:1 leadership page\n.\nFor team members working in AMER timezones who regularly collaborate with EMEA team members:\nIf all meeting attendees are located in AMER timezones, the meeting should be scheduled outside of the\nPST morning block\n.\nThe PST morning block should be reserved for\ncross-regional collaboration\nwith team members whose timezones make it harder for them to meet later in the day.\nFor team members working in AMER timezones who regularly collaborate with APAC team members:\nIf all meeting attendees are located in AMER timezones, the meeting should be scheduled outside of the\nPST afternoon block\n.\nThe PST afternoon block should be reserved for\ncross-regional collaboration\nwith team members whose timezones make it harder for them to meet earlier in the day.\nDue to the number of timezones covered in APAC, the\nPST afternoon block\nwill only overlap with the Eastern most APAC countries\nIf you want to ask GitLab team members if they are available for an event please send a calendar invite with Google Calendar using your Google GitLab account to their Google GitLab account. When you add a GitLab team member as a ‚ÄúGuest‚Äù in Google Calendar, you can click the See Guest Availability button to check availability and find a time on their calendar. These calendar invites will automatically show up on all parties calendars even when the email is not opened. It is an easier way to ensure everyone has visibility to the meeting and member‚Äôs status. Please respond quickly to invites so people can make necessary plans.\nIf you want to check if a team member is available for an outside meeting, create a calendar appointment and invite the team member only after they respond yes. Then invite outside people.\nWhen scheduling a call with multiple people, invite them using a Google Calendar that is your own, or one specific to the people joining, so the calendar item doesn‚Äôt unnecessarily appear on other people‚Äôs calendars.\nIf you want to move a meeting just move the calendar appointment instead of reaching out via other channels. Note the change at the top of the description.\nPlease click ‚ÄòGuests can modify event‚Äô so people can update the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out via other channels. You can configure this to be checked by default under\nEvent Settings\n.)\nWhen scheduling a meeting we value people‚Äôs time and prefer the ‚Äúspeedy meetings‚Äù\nsetting in our Google Calendar\n. This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50 minutes leaving some time to:\nWrite notes and reflect\nRespond to urgent messages\nTake a\nbio break\nStretch your legs\nGrab a snack\nWhen scheduling a meeting, please try to have it start at :00 (hour) or :30 (mid-hour) to leave common start times available for other meetings on your attendees‚Äô calendars. Meetings should be for the time needed, so if you need 15 minutes just book that.\nWhen creating a calendar event that will be used company wide,\nplease place it on the GitLab Team Meetings Calendar\n. That way the event is easily located by all individuals.\nWhen you need to cancel a meeting, make sure to delete/decline the meeting and choose the option\nDelete & update guests\nto make sure everyone knows you can‚Äôt attend and don‚Äôt wait for you.\nIf you want to schedule a meeting with a person not on the team please use\nCalendly\n. Use Google Calendar directly if scheduling with a GitLab team member.\nMaterials Review\nare scheduled as all day not busy events as a reminder three days before the scheduled call.\nWhen scheduling recurring meetings, consider using\n(UTC+00:00) Coordinated Universal Time\nas the meeting time zone,\nso that the meeting time does not change for others when your local time zone changes.\nCross-regional Working Hours Recommendations\nIf you‚Äôre scheduling a meeting across multiple regions, consider using the time ranges below to respect common working hours.\nThe suggested times are organized by the regions that you‚Äôre trying to accommodate.\nEach suggested window is shown in the local time zone.\nFor example, if your meeting includes team members in EMEA and AMER, you could consider scheduling from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM Pacific Time.\nNote: Time zone offsets change throughout the year due to Daylight Savings Time, Summer Time, and similar time changes, so these suggested times may be less convenient at different times of year.\nTimezone\nStart\nEnd\nLondon/Lisbon\nParis/Rome\nIstanbul/Tel Aviv\nAbu Dhabi\nMumbai\nPacific Time\nEastern Time\nTimezone\nStart\nEnd\nSydney\nTokyo\nHong Kong\nHo Chi Minh\nPacific Time\nEastern Time\nTimezone\nStart\nEnd\nLisbon/Dublin\nParis/Rome\nIstanbul/Tel Aviv\nMumbai\nHo Chi Minh\nHong Kong\nSydney\nMulti-session meeting naming\nWhen scheduling meetings with two or more sessions (usually when trying ensure worldwide coverage for all team members),\nname them after the topic, appended with a session number based on the order they show up in the calendar.\nTeam members will see the meeting invites in their email or calendar in relation to their local time zone and can decide for themselves which session to attend, based on their working hours.\nAvoid:\nTerms like\nfriendly\nor\nearly\n/\nlate\n, as these terms are overly subjective.\nAn early meeting for one team member might seem late for someone in a different time zone.\nOr a west coast AMER meeting might seem ‚ÄúAPAC friendly‚Äù, but not to someone in western APAC who is still asleep when the meeting starts.\nUsing\n,\n, or\nonly\nunless the meeting is specifically targeting members of that time zone.\nThese terms give the impression that only team members from those timezones are welcome, when people from any timezone with any working style are welcome.\nFor example:\nScheduled time\nPreferred\nAvoid\n‚ÄúAll members meeting - Session 1‚Äù\n‚ÄúAll members meeting - EMEA/AMER‚Äù\n‚ÄúAll members meeting - Session 2‚Äù\n‚ÄúAll members meeting - AMER/APAC friendly‚Äù\n‚ÄúAll members meeting - Session 3‚Äù\n‚ÄúAll members meeting - APAC/EMEA only‚Äù\nVideo calls\nUse video calls if you find yourself going back and forth in an issue/via email\nor over chat. Guideline: if you have gone\nback and forth 3 times\n, it‚Äôs time\nfor a video call.\nSometimes it‚Äôs better to\nnot\nhave a video call. Consider these tradeoffs:\nIt is difficult (or impossible) to multi-task in a video call.\nIt may be more efficient to have an async conversation in an issue, depending on the topic.\nA video call is limited in time: A conversation in an issue can start or stop at any time, whenever there‚Äôs interest. It is async.\nA video call is limited in people: You can invite anybody into an async conversation at any time in an issue. You don‚Äôt have to know who the relevant parties are ahead of time. Everyone can contribute at any time. A video call is limited to invited attendees (and those who have accepted).\nYou can easily ‚Äúpromote‚Äù an async conversation from an issue to a video call, as needed. The reverse is harder. So there is lower risk to start with an async conversation.\nFor a newcomer to the conversation, it‚Äôs easier and more efficient to parse an issue, than read a video transcript or watch it.\nConversations in issues are easily searchable. Video calls are not.\nTry to have your video on at all times because it‚Äôs much more engaging for participants.\nDo not worry if you\ncan‚Äôt pay attention at the meeting\nbecause you‚Äôre doing something else, you are the manager of your attention. The flip-side of being the manager of your own attention is that others should not hesitate to request your attention when it is needed.\nDuring internal calls, it‚Äôs okay to eat on video if you‚Äôre hungry or the call is during your lunch time (please turn your mic off). To maintain professionalism, if you are presenting or facilitating a customer call please try to avoid eating. If eating during a customer call is unavoidable, please turn off your video and mute your mic.\nYou should ensure that you are properly dressed for all video calls. Properly dressed means that you are wearing clothing that covers the top and bottom parts of your body. We do not have a strict dress code policy, but want to make sure that all participants on video calls feel comfortable. If you cannot be properly dressed for the entirety of the call, you should not join, but watch the recording at a later time.\nHaving pets, children, significant others, friends, and family visible during video chats is encouraged. If they are human, ask them to wave at your remote team member to say\n‚ÄúHi in your native language‚Äù\n.\nDo not feel forced to have your video on, use your best judgement.\nAdditional points for video calls with customers or partners:\nResults come first. Your appearance, location and background is less important than making customers successful so don‚Äôt wait for the perfect time / place when you can engage a customer right away.\nCommunicating that GitLab is an enterprise grade product and service provider is supported by the way you present yourself. Most of the time, if you would not wear something or present yourself in a certain way at a customer‚Äôs office, candidate interview, or partner meeting in person then it‚Äôs probably not the right choice on a video call with them either.\nGreen screens are a great background solution. It‚Äôs great to work in your garage or basement! Just get a green screen behind you and put up a professional background image to present well externally and still use the rest of the room how you want!\nWe prefer\nZoom\n.\nGoogle Calendar also has a\nZoom plugin\nwhere you can easily add a Zoom link for a video call to the invite.\nFor meetings that are scheduled with Zoom:\nAfter reviewing our\nZoom\nhandbook page, if you have additional questions, please contact IT in the\n#it_help\nSlack channel.\nNote that if you select to record meetings to the cloud (setting within Zoom), you must include the text\nin the meeting title if you want them to be automatically placed in the\nGitLab Videos Recorded\nfolder in Google Drive on an hourly basis via a\nscheduled pipeline\n.\nYou can find these videos in Google Drive by looking under\nShared drives\nand\nGitLab Videos Recorded\n. If you do not have access to this drive, contact\nIT Ops\n.\nThe\nscript for syncing the files is here\n.\nNote also that after a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred.\nConsider using a utility to easily mute/unmute yourself, see\nShush\nin the tools section.\nHybrid calls are annoying\n.\nAlways be sure to advise participants to mute their mics if there is unnecessary background noise to ensure the speaker is able to be heard by all attendees.\nWe start on time and do not wait for people. People are expected to join no later than the scheduled minute of the meeting (before :01 if it is scheduled for :00). The question ‚Äòis everyone here‚Äô is not needed.\nIt feels rude in video calls to interrupt people.\nThis is a situation where we have to do something counter intuitive to make all-remote meetings work.\nIn GitLab, everyone is encouraged to interrupt the speaker in a video call to ask a question or offer context.\nWe want everyone to contribute instead of a monologue.\nInterrupting can be done by clicking ‚ÄúRaise Hand‚Äù in Zoom, by physically raising your hand on video, or by interrupting verbally.\nAs a speaker, allow yourself to be interrupted.\nAs a listener, advocate (verbally if necessary) for those who have raised their hand.\nJust like in-person meetings be cognizant of when, who, and how you interrupt, we don‚Äôt want\nmanterrupting\n.\nWe end on the scheduled time. It might feel rude to end a meeting, but you‚Äôre actually allowing all attendees to be on time for their next meeting.\nDo not use the chat of products like Zoom to communicate during the call, use the linked document instead. Zoom Chat has been configured for a 30 day retention. This allows everyone to contribute additional questions, answers, and links in the relevant place. It also makes it easier for people in conflicting timezones to contribute questions before the call and makes it easier to review questions and answers after the call, which can be before watching the recording.\nYou do not need to remind other people to vocalize their questions. Just say their name and a keyword of the question, e.g. ‚ÄòJay about credit-cards‚Äô.\nEvery comment is document worthy, even small support comments such as\n+1\nor\nVery Cool!\n.\nWe encourage the recording and\nsharing of everything to our YouTube Unfiltered channel\n.\nIt is unusual to smoke in an open office or video conference, vaping is associated with this. For this reason we ask that you don‚Äôt vape during calls, and if you absolutely have to, kindly switch your camera off.\nSpeak up when you notice something is not working. If you notice someone‚Äôs microphone, web cam or latency is causing issues for them it is good to speak up. On a video call it can be harder for the speaker to notice that they aren‚Äôt being understood compared to a face to face conversation. As such you will be doing them a favour by speaking up early to let them know that they are having a problem. Also see\nHear nothing say something\nfor further explanation.\nYou are the manager of your attention\nYou are the manager of your attention, and you decide when you do or don‚Äôt pay attention in a meeting.\nYou will always have more work than time in your life.\nIf you get invited to a meeting you don‚Äôt think you should go to, you should decline the meeting.\nIt is better to cancel than to show up and not pay attention.\nOn the other hand, not every part of a meeting is relevant, but it can sometimes be helpful to have more people in a call.\nIf you only have one discussion point, if possible, try to reorder the meeting agenda to have your point first and then drop from the call.\nIf you get asked a question when you‚Äôre not paying attention, it is an okay use of time to repeat a question every now and then.\nIf training is required for one‚Äôs role, team members should plan to give the training full attention‚Äìespecially if engagement in discussions or breakout rooms is required. If training is ‚Äônice to learn‚Äô or ‚Äòoptional‚Äô for team members, multi-tasking can be done at the team members discretion.\nWe don‚Äôt use the first 15 minutes of a meeting to read the materials like they\ndo at Amazon\n. You can use the start of a meeting to review the materials for the meeting if you need to, given you do not have to be paying attention, but that should not delay the start of the meeting for the people that already have questions based on the materials.\nMeetings start on time at GitLab.\nDo not use your camera to signal you‚Äôre not paying attention;\ncameras should always be on\n.\nDo not ask meeting attendees to pay attention\nThere are too few hours in a week, so we expect each team member to\nmanage their attention\n. If you‚Äôre hosting a meeting, don‚Äôt tell people to give you their attention or stop multi-tasking. Respect each team member‚Äôs agency over their time. Instead of demanding attention, earn participants‚Äô attention by organizing and facilitating meetings so they are compelling to attendees.\nFirst post is a badge of honor\nYou should take pride in being the first person to add a question to a\nmeeting agenda, however unlike\nthe First post\nmeme we do want the first post to be\nmore than just ‚ÄúFirst!‚Äù. The meeting DRI will be happy to see there is a\nquestion ready before to kick off the meeting. The Meeting DRI should remember\nto thank the person for asking the first question.\nDo not do a countdown before ending a call\nNever do a countdown or say something like. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give it x seconds‚Äù, people are very unlikely to ask a question if you do that. Either ask for a question, wait for a question, or end the call.\nHybrid calls are annoying\nIn calls that have remote participants everyone should use their own equipment (camera, headset, screen).\nWhen multiple people share equipment the following\nproblems arise for remote participants\n:\nCan‚Äôt hear the sharing people well\nBackground noise since the microphone of the sharing people is on all the time\nCan‚Äôt clearly see facial expressions since each face takes up only a small part of the screen\nCan‚Äôt easily see who is talking since the screen shows multiple people\nHard getting a word in since their delay is longer than for the sharing people\nThe\npeople sharing equipment also have problems\nbecause they don‚Äôt have their own equipment:\nCan‚Äôt easily screen share something themselves\nTrouble seeing details in screen sharing since the screen is further away from them\nCan‚Äôt scroll through a slide deck at their own pace\nSharing people can‚Äôt easily participate (view or type) in a shared document with the agenda and meeting notes.\nThe disadvantages for remote people are much greater than for the sharing people and hard to notice for the sharing people.\nThe disadvantages cause previously remote participants to travel to the meeting to be in person for a better experience.\nThe extra travel is inefficient since it is time consuming, expensive, bad for the environment, and unhealthy.\nTheoretically you can have multiple people in a room with their own equipment but in practice it is much better to be in separate rooms:\nIt is annoying to first hear someone talk in the room and then hear it over audio with a delay.\nIt is hard to consistently mute yourself when not talking to prevent someone else‚Äôs voice coming through your microphone as well.\nTypes of meetings\nAsk Me Anything meetings\ncan be a useful opportunity for team members to meet a new leader, learn more about an existing team member, or gain clarity on a recent change.\nFormat: AMAs use the whole meeting time for questions from attendees, answered by the host.\nFireside Chats\nFireside chats are informal conversations between a host and a guest. The guest is typically a new leader, board member, or guest speaker. They are a useful opportunity to learn specific information about these individuals and their professional careers and personal interests. Fireside chats allow the audience to learn more about the guests in a casual and approachable setting.\nFormat: In advance of the call, the host will prepare questions and share them with the guest. During the call, the host will moderate the conversation with the guest, by verbalizing the prepared questions. There is specific amount of time reserved at the end of the agenda for questions from attendees.\nWalk and Talk calls\nA Walk and Talk call is when team members step away from their computers and get outside for a meeting. The difference between a\ncoffee chat\nand a Walk and Talk call is that a Walk and Talk call be held with people that you interact with frequently at GitLab. It could be social in nature or focused on a specific problem/topic that needs to be discussed. If it‚Äôs a problem-solving focused discussion, the outcome should be captured in a merge request. It should not be used if the problem being discussed requires screen sharing or detailed note taking. There are great physical and mental health benefits to a walk and talk call. There are also benefits with\nincreased focus and creativity\n. A Walk and Talk can also help prevent\nZoom fatigue\n.\nThe team members can use Zoom on their mobile device with the audio only function, or call one another from their preferred mobile device. A walk and talk call should be agreed to in advance to ensure that the local weather is compatible for a walk in both locations and that the walk and talk call fits into both team members‚Äô schedules. We‚Äôve created a Slack channel #walk-and-talk-meetings where, if you‚Äôd like, you can share pictures from your walking meetings.\nRelease retrospectives and kickoffs\nAfter GitLab releases a new version\nevery month\n, we have a\n30-minute call a few days later reflecting on what could have been\nbetter:\nWhat went well this month?\nWhat went wrong this month?\nWhat could we have done better?\nWe spend the first part of the retrospective meeting reviewing the action\nitems from the previous month.\nOn the 8th of each month (or the next business day), we have a kickoff meeting\nfor the version that will be released in the following month. The product team and other leads will have already had\ndiscussions on what should be prioritized for that release. The purpose of this kickoff is\nto get everyone on the same page and to invite comments.\nBoth the retrospectives and kickoffs are\nlive streamed to our GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel\nand posted to our\nUnfiltered YouTube channel\n.\nDeep Dives\nAs GitLab continues to grow, sharing knowledge across the community becomes even more important.\nThe\nDeep Dives page\ndescribes initiatives we are trying to encourage.\nThis aligns with how we work since everything at GitLab is\npublic by default\n.\nDaily Sync Escalation Process\nGitLab has a specific process to follow in crisis situations to ensure effective communications. Details can be found in the\ninternal handbook\n.\nPresentations\nAll presentations are made in Google Slides using\nour templates\n.\nPlease allow anyone at GitLab to edit the presentation (preferred) or at least comment on the presentation.\nIf the content can be public use File > Publish to the web > Publish to get a URL and paste that in the speaker notes of the first slide (commonly the title slide).\nThe title of every slide should be the message you want the audience to take away, not the subject matter. So use ‚ÄòOur revenue more than doubled‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòRevenue growth‚Äô.\nSlide titles should not be more than one line. Be concise in highlighting the key point that you want to make.\nDo not add a period at the end of a title.\nDuring introductions, make sure that nobody is presenting. We remember people better and have more empathy when we clearly see peoples faces and expressions.\nAt the end of the presentation, when you go to Q&A, stop presenting in Zoom. This way the other people can see the person who is speaking much better.\nAll presentations at GitLab should be based on screenshots of the handbook, issues, merge requests, review apps, and data from GitLab Insights and Sisense charts. In most cases it shouldn‚Äôt be needed to make content uniquely for the presentation. If you need something that doesn‚Äôt exist yet add it to the place it belongs and then copy it into the presentation. This way we can have a\nSingle Source of Truth\nfor everything we do. By using screenshots you indicate to people you did the right thing and they can find the canonical source in the appropriate place. Having to find information by digging through old presentations doesn‚Äôt scale. Consider linking the screenshot to the original source.\nDo not use cumulative graphs internally. For example total ARR, total user, total contributors, or total Merge Requests. Instead use IACV per dollar spend, users added per month, contributions per month, or\nMR rate\n. Cumulative graphs can\nhide trends\nand are\nfar more likely to be misinterpreted\n. The only acceptable use of cumulative graphs is for external presentations where they are expected by the audience and commonly used.\nWhen your presentation includes graphs or other data, make sure your graphs have clear titles and dimensions. Make sure your data has significant figures and labels. For example, use ‚ÄòJanuary: 1.95M projects‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòJanuary: 1.95M‚Äô. Keep in mind that your audience may not have the full context, especially if they are reading the presentation asynchronously.\nWhen giving a presentation, your commentary should not be a regurgitation of the words in the slide. The audience can read the slide for themselves; your commentary should focus on the most important takeaways.\nVideo and presentation tips with Lorraine Lee\nOn 2022-01-20, the L&D team hosted\nLorraine Lee\nfor a live speaker series on video and presentation techniques in an all-remote workspace.\nKey points addressed in the training include:\nIncrease your confidence on video\nusing lighting, visuals, and curating your environment\nKeep your audience engaged\nwith movement, power words, and the think/do/feel matrix\nStay connected with your audience\nby smiling, making eye contact, and framing yourself in video\nInsert energy\nby standing up, projecting, and using hand gestures\nWatch the replay below:\nWriting style guidelines\nAs you‚Äôre creating external or business content for GitLab, please refer to the\nGitLab Content Style Guide\n. For technical content, you can reference\nthis word list\n.\nThis list offers additional guidance for written communication at GitLab:\nDo not use rich text, it makes it hard to copy/paste. Use\nMarkdown\nto format text that is stored in a Git repository. In Google Docs, use ‚ÄúNormal text‚Äù using the style/heading/formatting dropdown and paste without formatting.\nRead our\nMarkdown Style Guide\nfor more information when using Markdown.\nDo not use ALL CAPS because it\nfeels like shouting\n. However, there is the\n#all-caps\nSlack channel\nfor your good-natured shouting needs.\nWe use Unix style (\nlf\n) line endings, not Windows style (\ncrlf\n), please ensure\n*.md text eol=lf\nis set in the repository‚Äôs\n.gitattributes\nand run\ngit config --global core.autocrlf input\non your client.\nWhen specifying measurements, please include both Metric and Imperial equivalents.\nWhen mentioning currency amounts that team members may need to convert to their local currency (e.g. benefits, expenses, or bonuses), link those amounts to our\nExchange Rates\nsection (e.g.\n).\nMonetary amounts shouldn‚Äôt have one digit, so prefer $19.90 to $19.9.\nGitLab is an internationally diverse company. US-based team members should not refer to team members outside the US as ‚Äúinternational‚Äù. Instead, use ‚Äúnon-US‚Äù. Please also avoid the use of ‚Äúoffshore/overseas‚Äù to refer to non-American continents.\nIf you have multiple points in a comment or email, please number them. Numbered lists are easier to reference during a discussion over bulleted lists.\nWhen you reference an issue, merge request, comment, commit, page, doc, etc. and you have the URL available, please include it.\nIn making URLs, always prefer hyphens to underscores, and always use lowercase.\nThe community includes users, contributors, core team members, customers, people working for GitLab Inc., and friends of GitLab. If you want to refer to ‚Äúpeople not working for GitLab Inc.‚Äù, just say that, and don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù. If you want to refer to people working for GitLab Inc., you can also use ‚Äúthe GitLab Inc. team‚Äù, but don‚Äôt use ‚ÄúGitLab Inc. employees‚Äù.\nWhen we refer to the GitLab community (excluding GitLab team members), please say ‚Äúwider community‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù.\nAll people working for GitLab (the company) are the\nGitLab team\n. We also have the\nCore team\nthat consists of volunteers.\nPlease always refer to GitLab Inc. people as GitLab team members, not employees.\nUse\ninclusive and gender-neutral language\nin all writing.\nAlways write ‚ÄúGitLab‚Äù with ‚ÄúG‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù capitalized, even when writing ‚ÄúGitLab.com‚Äù, except within URLs. When ‚Äúgitlab.com‚Äù is part of a URL, it should be lowercase.\nDo not use a hyphen when writing the term ‚Äúopen source‚Äù except where doing so eliminates ambiguity or clumsiness.\nIf an email needs a response, write the answer at the top of it.\nUse the future version of words, just like we don‚Äôt write internet with a capital letter anymore. We write frontend and webhook without a hyphen or space.\nOur homepage is\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/\n(with the\nabout.\nand with\nhttps\n).\nIf you use headers, properly format them (\n##\nin Markdown, ‚ÄúHeading 2‚Äù in Google Docs); start at the second header level because header level 1 is for titles. Do not end headers with a colon. Do not use emoji in headers as these cause links to have strange characters.\nDo not use acronyms when you can avoid them. Acronyms have the effect of excluding people from the conversation if they are not familiar with a particular term. Example: instead of\n, write\nmerge request (MR)\n.\nIf acronyms are used, expand them at least once in the conversation or document and define them in the document using\nKramdown abbreviation syntax\n. Alternatively, link to the definition.\nIf you don‚Äôt know the meaning of an acronym, ask. It‚Äôs always ok to\nspeak up\n.\nCommunicating dates and time\nFor external content, refer to the guidance in the\nGitLab Content Style Guide\n.\nFor internal content, use ISO dates:\nyyyy-mm-dd\nFor months, use\nyyyy-mm\n, so 2018-01 for January.\nRefer to a year with CY18 (never with 2018) and a quarter with CY18-Q1 to prevent confusion with fiscal years and quarters. If the year is obvious from the context it is OK to use Dec 4, but not 12/4.\nGitLab operates on a\nFiscal Year\noffset from the calendar year. When referring to a fiscal year or quarter, please use the following abbreviations:\n‚ÄúFY20‚Äù is the preferred format and means: Fiscal Year 2020, the period running from February 1, 2019 through January 31, 2020\n‚ÄúQ1‚Äù = the first quarter of the current Fiscal Year, so on Feb 1, 2020, ‚ÄúQ1‚Äù is the period from Feb. 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Note that Epics in GitLab follow Calendar Years and Quarters.\nWhen referring to a quarter in a future or past year, combine the two above: ‚ÄúFY21-Q1‚Äù\nWhen financial data is presented, include a note to indicate fiscal year (e.g. ‚ÄúFiscal Year ending January, 31 ‚ÄòYYYY‚Äù)\nFor time formatting guidelines, refer to the\nGitLab Content Style Guide\n.\nPlease remember that not everyone is working in the same timezone; what may be morning for you is evening for someone else. Try to say 3 hours ago or 4 hours from now, or use a timestamp, including a timezone reference.\nDon‚Äôt use ‚ÄúEOD‚Äù or ‚Äúend of day‚Äù (‚ÄúCOB‚Äù or ‚Äúclose of business‚Äù, ‚ÄúEOB‚Äù or ‚Äúend of business‚Äù), unless you are okay with a deliverable being due at the end of\nanywhere on earth\n. Team members communicate across timezones, where ‚Äúend of day‚Äù does not specify the exact date and time. When you want something due at a specific time,\ncommunicate the date and time\nby when the request should be done, for example:\nPlease review before 2023-06-10 5PM PT\n.\nVisuals\nMany times an explanation can be aided by a visual.\nWhenever presenting a diagram, we should still allow everyone to contribute.\nWhere possible, take advantage of the handbook‚Äôs support for\nMermaid\n. If you are new to using Mermaid or need help troubleshooting errors in your Mermaid code, the\nMermaid Live Editor\ncan be a helpful tool.\nWhere taking advantage of Mermaid isn‚Äôt possible, link to the original in our Google Drive so that the diagram can be edited by anyone.\nUbiquitous language\nAt GitLab we use\nubiquitous language\nto increase communication efficiency.\nThis is defined in\nDomain-driven design\nas: ‚ÄúA language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.‚Äù\nWe use it for activities in GitLab, even ones not implemented in software.\nBy having ubiquitous words to identify concepts we prevent confusion over what is meant, for example we refer to\nparts of our organization\nas a function, department, or group depending on exactly what is meant.\nMake sure that domains don‚Äôt overlap, for example\norganization size\nand\ndeal size\ndon‚Äôt reuse words to prevent overlap.\nIf a term is ambiguous don‚Äôt use it, for example our hiring team uses the terms\nroles\nand\nvacancies\n, but avoid the ambiguous word\njob\n.\nMake sure that projects and working groups have clear and direct names. Prefer ‚ÄúCI Spend Reduction Working Group‚Äù to ‚ÄúProject Raven Working Group‚Äù.\nMake sure that people can infer as much as possible from the word, for example our\nsubscription options\nallow you to know if someone is using self-managed or GitLab.com.\nMake sure terms don‚Äôt overlap without clearly defining how and why, for example see our\ntier definitions\n.\nKeep terms to one or at most two words to prevent people from introducing ambiguity by shortening a term. When using two words make the first word unique because people tend to drop the second word more often.\nMECEFU terms\nMECEFU is an acronym for Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive Few words Ubiquitous-language.\nYou pronounce it: MessiFu. Think of the great soccer player Lionel Messi and his\nkung fu\nor soccer fu skills.\nWe want to use MECEFU terms to describe a domain to ensure efficient communication. MECEFU terms have 4 characteristics that help with efficiency:\nMutually Exclusive: nothing is referenced by more than one term\nCollectively Exhaustive: everything is covered by one of the terms\nFew words: the longer terms are the more likely it is people will not use all of them and cause confusion, therefore consider two words as the upper limit for a single term. Avoid acronyms because they are hard to remember (we‚Äôre open to a few words to replace MECEFU as an acronym :)\nUbiquitous language:\ndefined above\nAn example of a MECEFU term is our\nsales segmentation\n:\nMutually Exclusive: There is no overlap between the numbers and there is a single dimension.\nCollectively Exhaustive: Everything for 0 to infinite employees is covered.\nFew words: Mid-market is a natural combination and SMB is abbreviated.\nUbiquitous language: We‚Äôre not using the word ‚ÄòEnterprise‚Äô which already can refer to our Enterprise Edition distribution.\nOne nit-pick is that the Medium of SMB and Mid of Mid-Market sound very similar.\nSimple language\nSimple Language is meant to encourage everyone at GitLab to simplify the language we use.\nWe should always use the most clear, straightforward, and meaningful words possible in every conversation.\nAvoid using ‚Äúfluff‚Äù words, jargon, or ‚Äúcorporate-speak‚Äù phrases that don‚Äôt add value.\nWhen you\ndon‚Äôt\nuse Simple Language, you:\nConfuse people and create a barrier for participants of your conversation.\nCause others to not speak up in a meeting because they don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying.\nAre not inclusive of those whose first language is not English.\nDo not add value with your words.\nWhen you\ndo\nuse Simple Language, you:\nGet work done more efficiently.\nBuild credibility with your audience (your team, coworker, customer, etc.).\nKeep people‚Äôs attention while you‚Äôre speaking.\nCome across more confident and knowledgeable.\nHere‚Äôs an example:\nOriginal sentence\nWe‚Äôre now launching an optimization of our approach leveraging key learnings from the project‚Äôs postmortem.\nA Simple Language sentence\nWe‚Äôre creating a new plan based on what we learned from this project.\nSimple Language is important both when we‚Äôre speaking to other team members and when we‚Äôre representing GitLab to people outside the company.\nBe sure to use Simple Language in written communications as well.\nOur handbook, website, docs, marketing materials, and candidate or customer emails should be clear, concise, and effective.\nCorporate marketing maintains guidelines on\nGitLab‚Äôs tone of voice\n.\nInstead of‚Ä¶\nTry‚Ä¶\nGetting buy-in/Getting alignment\nAsking for feedback since DRIs make decisions\nSynergy\nEffective Collaboration\nGet all your ducks in a row\nBe organized\nDo not let the grass grow too long\nWork quickly\nLeverage\nUse more explicit phrasing- debt, etc.\nSend it over the wall\nShare it with a customer\nBoil the ocean\nWaste time\nPunt\nMake less of a priority\nHelicopter view/100 foot view\nA broad view of the business\nTurtles all the way down\nCascade through the organization\nWhen someone has spare/extra cycles\nWhen someone is available\nInefficient things shouldn‚Äôt sound positive\nFor example, do not suggest that you‚Äôre ‚Äúworking in real-time‚Äù when a matter is in disarray. Convey that a lack of organization is hampering a result, and provide feedback and clear steps on resolving.\nDo not use a cool term such as ‚Äútiger team‚Äù when the\nexisting term of ‚Äúworking group‚Äù\nis more exact. While cool terms such as these may be useful for persuading colleagues to join you in working towards a solution, the right way isn‚Äôt to use flowery language.\nThe last example is when we used ‚ÄòPrioritizing for Global Optimization‚Äô for what we renamed to headcount reset. When we\nrenamed it\nwe saw a good reduction in the use of this disruptive practice of moving people around.\nUsing additional languages\nUsing American English as our standard language supports our values such as efficiency, results, and transparency.\nCareful use of another person‚Äôs language can be a celebration of diversity and build an atmosphere of inclusion.\nThe guidance in this section applies to written one-to-one communication, for example, merge request comments between an author and reviewer, not merge request descriptions or commit messages. Also keep the following in mind:\nUse of an additional language is optional.\nStick to the few simple phrases in the table below.\nAlways include the language used and a translation to English.\nTeam members can choose to indicate the languages they speak in their Slack profile.\nWhen in doubt, use American English.\nHere‚Äôs an example:\nHey @nmalcolm, I left some suggestions for your merge request. Ka mau te wehi! (Te Reo MƒÅori: great work / well done!)\n„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô (Japanese: thank you very much) for the review @cynthia!\nLanguage\nHello\nThank you\nGreat work / well done\nCroatian\nHvala\nJapanese\n„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô\nTe Reo MƒÅori\nKia ora\nNgƒÅ mihi\nKa mau te wehi!\nAvoid using Git in Project Names\nAvoid using\nGit\nin the naming of internal and external company related programs (BagGit, GitFit, Gitty, GitIt, etc.). Referencing Git creates an inaccurate perception that GitLab has a narrow focus. While GitLab started as a source control platform, it has become\nThe DevOps Platform\n.\nEmail\nWe have a low internal email culture, as we see greater efficiency in other forms of communication (e.g. Slack). If you are emailing, please use the following guidelines:\nSend one email per subject as multiple items in one email will cause delays (have to respond to everything) or misses (forgot one of the items).\nAlways reply to emails by replying to all, even when no action is needed. This lets the other person know that you received it. A thread is done when there is a single word reply, such as OK, thanks, or done.\nIf you‚Äôre sending an email to a large group of people (or a distribution list), put those recipients in BCC (rather than in the ‚ÄúTo‚Äù field) so that a reply all won‚Äôt ping hundreds of people.\nIf you forward an email without other comments please add FYI (for your information), FYA (for your action), or FYC (for your consideration). If you forward an external request with FYC it just means the person who forwarded it will not follow up on the request and expects you to decide if you should follow up or not, the terms comes from\nmovie promotion to voters\n.\nEmail forwarding rules are specified in the shared\nEmail, Slack, and GitLab Groups and Aliases\nGoogle Doc accessible only to people in the company. If you want to be added or removed from an internal alias, change a rule, or add a forwarding email alias, please\nsuggest an edit\nin the doc and\nsubmit a new access request\n.\nOnly Google Workspace domain admins are allowed to provision Google Groups and email distributions.\nEmails are asynchronous, for example, if your manager emails you on a weekend it is fine to reply during the workweek.\nIf an email is or has become\nurgent\nfeel free to ping people via chat referencing the subject of the email.\nIf you or your team needs to send an email to a group of team members, not grouped in a current\nGoogle email group\n, and specifically related to personally identifiable information (location, state, country, etc.) please contact a Total Rewards Analyst at total-rewards@gitlab who can create an email list from Workday data, with approval.\nWhere appropriate, consider using professional salutations including Hi or Hello and avoid colloquial expressions such as Hey, Oh, or Sup. Sometimes only the person‚Äôs name is suitable. The level of formality should often mirror the formality from previous messages when communicating with internal team members as well as external persons.\nTry to always use a person‚Äôs name when starting or responding to a message, especially if there are multiple persons cc‚Äôd, so that the addressee knows you are addressing them.\nMake sure all relevant letters and words that need capitalization are capitalized, such as the start of sentences or the word ‚ÄúI‚Äù.\nProofread your messages so that sentences are punctuated correctly, typos are fixed, and grammar is corrected. Consider using the really helpful\nGrammarly\ntool - this tool is great for both native English speakers and for those who use English as an additional language.\nAll messages and replies are signed with a professional send-off (ex. Best regards), your name, and your signature block.\nSlack\nSlack is used for:\nInternal-only communication and announcements impacting all team members\nLinking a GitLab Issue or Merge Request (confidential if necessary) where discussion can take place is encouraged when sharing announcements on Slack\nConsider creating a\nManager Mention MR\n, so that we can collaborate with Efficiency and Transparency across threads\nCompany newsletters and team updates\nAsynchronous team standups, questions, and quick collaboration\nInformal communication\nUse a\nbias for action\nto quickly move conversations that require collaboration and action out of Slack and into an issue.\nOnly 90 days of Slack activity will be retained, so Slack should specifically NOT be used for:\nObtaining approvals\nDocumenting decisions\nStoring official company records or documents\nSharing personal or sensitive information regarding any individuals\nInternal Slack messages between team members are still considered professional communication. Please do not use or add emoji‚Äôs to Slack that are of a political, religious or of a sexual nature. You can refer to the\nReligion and politics at work\nsection of the handbook. When in doubt do not use or add the emoji. If you have any concerns about an emoji that was used, please reach out to the author or if you are not comfortable doing so please reach out to your\nPeople Business Partner\n.\nThere is a lot of information pertaining to Slack, as it is a critical part of GitLab‚Äôs communication. See the\nSlack tools and tips page\n.\nGeneral guidelines\nEveryone can contribute, and while opinions are important to provide perspective, we value\nproposals\nand\niteration\n. If the subject is of value to the wider community, consider commenting on an existing issue or opening a new\nmerge request\ninstead.\nUse the\n:white_check_mark:\nemoji or similar to indicate an inquiry has been answered. Anyone can add the emoji. If you‚Äôre not sure, then feel free to leave it up to the person who asked. An emoji indicator is particularly helpful in channels where lots of questions are posted, such as\n#questions\n, and\n#git-help\n.\nIn general, you can think of emoji reactions as equivalent to body-language responses we use in real-life conversations, such as nodding your head as encouragement when a verbal (or in Slack, written) response might be too much. However, please be aware that use and understanding of emoji, like body-language, is not universal. Others may not communicate via those means the same way that you do, particularly those who are Autistic or otherwise neurodivergent. If in doubt, you can use text to clarify.\nIn both public and private channels,\nthreads\nare valuable for keeping conversations together. If you want to respond to a question or comment in a channel, please start a thread instead of responding below them in the channel. This helps to keep the discussion in one place where it is easy to follow, and reduces noise as each message in a thread does not result in an unread message for everyone in the channel.\nUnless you‚Äôre in an active chat, don‚Äôt break up a topic into multiple messages as each one will result in a notification which can be disruptive. Use\nthreads\nif you want to provide extra info to the question/comment you posted.\nIf you are having a hard time keeping up with messages, you can update your preferences to have Slack email you all notifications. To change the setting, go to\nPreferences > Notifications > When I'm not active on desktop...\nand ‚Äúsend me email notifications.‚Äù\nIf you agree in a message to start a video call (typically by asking ‚ÄúCall?‚Äù) the person that didn‚Äôt leave the last comment starts the call. So either respond to the ‚ÄúCall?‚Äù request with a video link or say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and let the other person start it. Do not say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and start a call 5 seconds later since it is likely you‚Äôll both be creating a video call link at the same time.\nAs an admin of the Slack workspace, if given the option to\n‚ÄúDisable future attachments from this website‚Äù\nwhen removing an attachment from a message\nthis will block the link/domain from\nunfurling\nin the entire Slack workspace\n. Be careful and deliberate when choosing this option as it will impact every user in the workspace.\nWhen referencing a Slack thread in a GitLab.com issue, don‚Äôt\nonly\nlink to the thread. Not only will people outside of the GitLab organization be unable to access the content, but the link will expire after the Slack retention period expires. Instead:\nReview the contents\nfor confidentiality of users, customers, or any other sensitive information before posting.\nCopy and paste the relevant parts of the thread into the issue using blockquote formatting.\nLink to the Slack thread and include\n(internal)\nafter the link. For example:\nhttps://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C0AR2KW4B/p1555347101079800\n(internal)\nPost a link to the issue note in the Slack thread to let others know that discussion has moved to the issue.\nWhen selecting your Slack display name, please do not have your name in all capital letters as this is often\nassociated as shouting\nin written communications.\nAvoid direct messages\nNote:\nWe don‚Äôt use the term\nprivate message\n, because these\ndirect messages\nare not inherently\nprivate\nlike a phone call or private letter. The messages are potentially accessible by Workspace admins or via Backups. Slack refers to these types of messages as\ndirect messages themselves\n.\nWhen using Slack for work-related purposes, please avoid direct messages.\nDirect messages discourage collaboration\n. You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help. Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.\nIf someone sends you a work-related direct message, it is okay to let them know you‚Äôd like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook. The process might look something like:\nIn the direct message:\nThanks for reaching out, that's a great question/idea I think the rest of the team could benefit from. I'm going to move this to #public-channel based on [our desire to avoid direct messages](/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages)\nIn the appropriate public channel:\n@Person asked \"question\" in a DM, pulling that out here if anyone else has input.\nAnswer the question in a thread on that channel message, allowing others to benefit.\nIf you find yourself getting a lot of direct messages that should go in a public channel, consider changing your Slack status to an attention grabbing emoji and set it to something like:\nPlease consider posting in a public channel before direct messaging\nWhy direct message me when you can post in a public channel?\nIf you must send a work-related direct message, don‚Äôt start a conversation with ‚ÄúHi‚Äù or ‚ÄúHey‚Äù as that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having trouble understanding issue #x, can we talk about it quickly?‚Äù.\nDo not use group direct messages\nUse private channels instead of group direct messages. Group direct messages are very hard to maintain, track, and respond to. They also have a key limitation in that you can‚Äôt add people to the conversation. This is a hindrance to collaboration and transparency.\nConsider whether the conversation can take place in a public channel. If not, please use a private channel instead. This channel may have a short-term purpose. It is acceptable to leave the channel and/or archive it if you are no longer an active participant or the channel is no longer in use.\nAs we grow headcount, we exponentially increase the lines of communication- 3 people have 3 communication lines, 4 have 6, and 41 have 820.\nAs a result, there is a natural tendency for people to prefer private channels of communication.\nCommunication is siloed.\nAs we grow, people may be reaching out to the wrong person.\nIf you have a question, other people might have it too.\nSlack is our primary source of chat communication and is where many personal interactions happen.\nWe want to continue to encourage folks to build personal relationships with one another which will often happen over DMs.\nUse public channels\nIf you use Slack and plan to message 3 or more people, we recommend a channel for customer/issue/project/problem/partnership.\nLearn about\ncommon channels and channel-naming conventions\n.\nIf something is important but not urgent - like complimenting or encouraging the entire team - use email or post in the channel without\n@\n-mentioning the team.\nIt‚Äôs not rude to leave a channel. When you‚Äôve had your questions answered or are no longer interested, feel free to leave the channel so it won‚Äôt distract you anymore.\nThe usage of ChatBots for integrations can sometimes depend upon the name of the channel. You should consult the channel about such integrations before changing the name of commonly used/popular channels to avoid inadvertently breaking integrations.\nBe respectful of others‚Äô time\nStart by understanding what we mean by respecting time. We should err toward putting material into channels over DMs and public channels over private channels even though we understand that this will generate more messages that can be read by more people. Respecting time is not about reducing the overall volume of channel messages that team members receive. It‚Äôs about making sure that messages are targeted, expectations for asynchronous responses are clear, and we are communicating with consideration.\nThe following tips provide ways to work respectfully with others given this context, though is not an exhaustive list:\nIf you‚Äôre only referring to someone, but don‚Äôt actually need their attention, and want to spare them from getting notified, spell out their name normally without\n@\nmentioning them.\nYou also do not need to\n@\nmention someone if they are part of a Slack thread unless you need their attention (for them to review, respond, etc.), since Slack has a dedicated view for threads.\nSlack messages should be considered asynchronous communication, and you should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the other person is doing.\nDo not feel obligated to respond to Slack messages when you are not working.\nFeel free to send a colleague a link to these guidelines if the communication in Slack should be done\nasynchronously\n.\nPlease avoid using @here or @channel unless this is about something urgent and important.\nIn chat, try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent and important, not just important. By overusing channel mentions, you make it harder to respond to personal mentions promptly since people get pinged too frequently. Additionally, if you are planning to\n@mention\na specific team (\nSlack User Group\n), consider the size of the group you are mentioning (\nsee group membership\n) and the impact of pinging all of these people for the particular situation. If something is urgent and important:\nUse\n@here\nto notify all currently\nactive\nmembers in the room. Please only use\n@here\nif the message is important\nand\nurgent.\nUse\n@channel\nto notify\nmembers in the room, irrespective of away status. Please only use\n@channel\nif the message is important\nand\nurgent.\nIf you are aware that your teammate is on vacation, avoid mentioning them in a high volume channel. It will be difficult to find the information or question when they return. If you need to ensure they refer back to the thread, ensure to send them a link to the relevant Slack message through a direct message.\nQuestions\nIf you have a question that you can‚Äôt find the answer to in our handbook (or you need help finding something in the handbook) team members across the company are here to help. Go directly to the subject matter experts/source in the\ndesignated slack channel\nto ensure your question is addressed.\nIf your question doesn‚Äôt relate to any of the existing topics:\nAsk it in the\n#questions\nSlack channel\nOnce you receive an answer, document it in the handbook and post the MR link in your question thread\n‚úîÔ∏è once you‚Äôve been helped\nWhen would GitLab use Corporate Export?\nThe times this feature would be used would be to comply with certain obligations. Corporate Export must be enabled by Slack in accordance with Slack‚Äôs policy, which can be found\nhere\n.\nExamples of instances where GitLab may need to use this feature may include, but are not limited to, those situations listed in\nSlack‚Äôs documentation\n.\nAre my direct messages and private channel conversations completely private?\nNo. The Slack Workspace Owner has the ability to export data from all direct messages and private channel conversations for the maximum retention period set by GitLab, which is currently set for 90-days. All messages that are older than 90-days cannot be exported by the Workspace Owner or any other Team Member at GitLab. While messages are not actively monitored, GitLab reserves the right to monitor its software for the reasons stated in its\nEmployee Privacy Policy\n, including, but not limited to, the safety and protection of our Team Members, the protection of our intellectual property, and the exercise or defense of legal claims.\nPlease keep\nin mind when communicating directly with other team members.\nIf you have a confidential personal issue that you do not feel comfortable discussing via a business-provided internal communications tool, it is recommended to use a personal form of communication such as a text message or phone call.\nFor additional questions, please address in the\nissue\n.\nEmergency chat\nSlack is down\nTo use the ‚ÄúSlack Down!‚Äù group chat on Zoom:\nIn the Zoom desktop app go to the\nTeam Chat\ntab\nClick\n+\nClick\nJoin a Channel\nSearch\nSlack down!\nClick\nJoin\nOnce service is restored, go back to Slack.\nZoom is down\nTo use Slack Huddle:\nNavigate to the appropriate Slack channel or direct message.\nUse\n/huddle\nto trigger a huddle, which supports both audio and video calls.\nYou may need to give permissions if it‚Äôs the first time you are using Slack calls.\nOnce service is restored, go back to Zoom.\nSlack and Zoom are down\nJoin the\nSlack Down!\nroom on Hangouts Chat.\nOnce service is restored, go back to Slack and Zoom.\nTypes of documents\nGoogle Docs\nNever use a Google Doc / Presentations for something non-confidential that has to end up on the website or the\nhandbook\n. Work on these edits via commits to a merge request. Then link to the merge request or diff to present the change to people. This prevents a duplication of effort and/or an out of date handbook.\nGoogle Docs can be useful when rapidly\niterating\n/commenting/suggesting on the content, but if the content is meant to be long lived it should be moved to the handbook as an SSOT and deprecated with a link to the handbook page. If the content is short lived, e.g. one-time report that won‚Äôt be referred to beyond 2-3 weeks, it can remain in a Google Doc or\npresentation\n.\nPageless is the GitLab preferred format\nGoogle Docs\nPageless format\nis the preferred format for company documents that won‚Äôt be printed. If you set your\ndefault to Pageless\nthen this will be applied to all future documents as well. If a document is likely going to be printed (for example, a contract) the older paged style is acceptable. See\nGood practices and helpful tips\nfor help navigating the pageless format.\nLink sharing\nIf you\ndo\nneed a Google Doc, create one with your company Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)\naccount and set the visibility, access controls and searchable flag according to the following guidelines.\nThe recommended defaults when sharing a document for GitLab internal purposes is setting visibility to\nGitLab\n, access to\nEditor\nand searchable\nCan find in search results\nto ensure everyone can contribute!\nNote:\nTo our knowledge, it is not possible to set the default to\nCan Edit\nand you have to change the permissions from\nView\nmanually. We hope that Google adds this capability in the future.\nVisibility Setting\nUse Cases\nAnyone with the link\nAvoid this setting. Instead, choose\nGitLab\n, then explicitly share the document with desired external individuals. Only use this if you want the document to be public but not indexed by Google.\nGitLab (Recommended Default)\nThis is the recommended default as it allows anyone within GitLab to easily discover documents via searching for their name within Drive.\nRestricted\nWhen the document contains highly sensitive or private information such as 1:1s with direct reports\nSearchable Setting\nEffect\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nCan find in search results.\nmakes the file available to anyone with a PeppGitLaberdine Google account and discoverable within GitLab Google Drive‚Äôs search feature.\nMust have link to access\nmakes the file available to anyone with a GitLab Google account who has the link.\nAccess Setting\nUse Cases\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nEditor\nAnyone that can view the document can edit it. This is the recommended setting when\nOn - GitLab\nis enabled for the document\nCommenter\nAnyone that can view the document can add a comment but cannot edit the document. This is ideal if you want to provide visibility but retain more fine-grained control of document editing.\nViewer\nIndividuals with access to the document will only be able to view it.\nReference Google‚Äôs\ndocumentation\non Link Sharing to learn more.\nGood practices & helpful tips\nIf you have content in a Google Doc that is later moved to the website or handbook,\ndeprecate the Google Doc\n.\nWhen referring to a Google Doc or folder on the Google Drive in the handbook, refrain from directly linking it. Instead, indicate the name of the doc. If you link the URL people from outside the organization can request access, creating workload and the potential for mistakes. (In the past, linking a Google Doc has led to inadvertently opening the sharing settings beyond what was intended.) This also helps prevent spam from people outside GitLab requesting access to a doc when clicking its link. To save people time you can also\nlink to the search results page\nwhich allows people to quickly get to the doc without anyone being able to request access. If there are multiple documents showing up in the search, you may filter your\nsearch link by adding the owner.\nIf you are having trouble finding a shared Google Doc, make sure you\nSearch <your domain>\nin Google Drive.\nIn our handbook, if you find yourself wondering whether it is better to provide a public link to a Google Doc vs. writing out the content on the website, use the following guideline: Is this document frequently adapted / customized? If yes, then provide a link, making sure that the document can be\ncommented on\nby\nanyone\nwith the link. For instance, this is how we share our employment\ncontracts\n. If the document is rarely customized, then provide the content directly on the site and deprecate the Google Doc.\nIf you want to quickly find where a team member‚Äôs cursor is in a Google Doc, click their icon at the top of the document and the app will jump you to the current location. This works in Sheets and Presentations as well.\nYou can set the notifications on a Google Doc so you only get emailed when someone tags you directly instead of getting emails for every comment. Click on ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù and select ‚ÄúOnly yours‚Äù. By the way, when you create the doc, it defaults to All, but when you are just shared with it, it defaults to Only yours. There is\nno global default\n.\nYou can find a template of the\nGitLab letterhead\non the shared Google Drive. Please be sure to make a copy of the document to your Google Drive before customizing the template for your use.\nIf you want to have the Google Doc be readable to the public, do not change the sharing settings from ‚ÄòEditable by Everyone at GitLab‚Äô,\npublish the document\ninstead.\nIn all cases, the sharing settings (who a document is shared with, if it is visible to the whole company, etc.) on a Google Doc should be the single source of truth for the confidentiality of the document.\nAvoid using your initials when adding content to Google Docs or referring to someone else. Use your full name, as Google Docs\nSmart Compose\nwill auto-complete names for you, and display information about the GitLab team member on hover. It makes documents more readable and consumable, especially for people outside your team/department.\nWhen there is a synchronous discussion about an issue or MR captured in a Google Doc, be sure to summarize the discussion into the issue or MR and link to the agenda item where it was discussed with a\nbookmark\n. If the notes are\nlimited access\nor no notes were taken, please say so. This will ensure that interested GitLab Team Members can see both the summary and context of the discussion.\nIn the\npageless format\nyou can use COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+J or\nView‚Äì>Hide Comments\nto quickly hide comments that reduce document width.\nWhen using Google Docs, paste full URLs rather than linking text.\nChips\nare the one acceptable alternative when linking to another Google document. Advantages for using URLs rather than hyperlinks include:\nGreater visibility when it is a long URL and specific. Links are important but easy to miss otherwise (short and only a different color and/or underlined).\nAbility to see what the content is without hovering over (which isn‚Äôt quick on mobile).\nMakes it easier to paste the content as formatting free text (not rich text), which we prefer and is sometimes the only option.\nHow to deprecate a Google Doc\nAdd ‚ÄòDeprecated: ‚Äô to the start of the title.\nRemove the content you moved.\nAdd a link to the new location at the beginning of the doc/first slide/first tab.\nAdd a link to the merge request or commit that moved it (if applicable).\nHandbook page\nPages like this are part of the\nhandbook\nProduct documentation\nGitLab Docs\n-\ndocs.gitlab.com\nis where you can find documentation on GitLab, the product.\nGitLab repositories\nrepository\n/\nrepositories\nare where files are kept under\nsource code management\n. In most cases, requires MRs to merge. The Handbooks are in a repository, our code is in a repository, etc.\nREADMEs\n-\nREADME.md\nfiles are what are shown by default when you browse a repository. Contains useful information to give context on what the project/repository are for. These can also be used for\nuser profiles\nas personal READMEs.\nGoogle Calendar\nWe recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to ‚ÄòMake available for GitLab - See all event details‚Äô. Consider marking the following appointments as ‚ÄòPrivate‚Äô:\nPersonal appointments\nConfidential & sensitive meetings with third-parties outside of GitLab\n1-1 performance or evaluation meetings\nMeetings on organizational changes\nThere are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone at GitLab:\nTransparency is one of our values and sharing what you work on is in line with our message of ‚Äúbe open about as many things as possible‚Äù.\nDue to our timezone differences, there are small windows of time when our availabilities overlap. If other members need to schedule a new meeting, seeing the details of recurring meetings (such as 1-1s) will allow for more flexibility in scheduling without needing to wait for a confirmation from the team member. This speaks to our value to be more efficient.\nIf you add blocks of time spent on recurring tasks to your Google Calendar to remind yourself to do things (e.g. ‚ÄúCheck Google Analytics‚Äù), consider marking yourself ‚ÄúFree‚Äù for those events so that coworkers know they may schedule a meeting during that time if they can‚Äôt find another convenient time.\nGoogle Calendar Appointment Scheduling\nThis feature allows you to create a link to an availability schedule that you can send to your customers or coworkers for them to schedule a call according to your availability.\nThis allows you to only show available spots while keeping your other calls private. This also avoids having to go back and forth between you and other person figuring out what day and time works best for both of you. Since this is a native Google Calendar functionality, there is no need to set up integrations with your calendar like other scheduling tools.\nA member of our Customer Success team created a\ndemo video of how to use this feature\n.\nExternal communication\nKey practices to consider during any meeting are listed below.\nVideo Calls - If this is your first time meeting a customer/prospect/partner/etc., turn on your camera when you login to Zoom. This will help to make the customer/prospect feel more comfortable as they are certain your undivided attention is geared towards them.\n‚ÄúNo agenda, no attenda‚Äù - Always have an\nagenda prepped and ready to go\n, with the exception of\ncoffee chats\n. Share this with your audience. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if there‚Äôs anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring. When sharing agendas with customers and partners it should be called ‚ÄúGitLab + Name Shared Collaboration & Agenda‚Äù, not ‚ÄúExternal Agenda‚Äù as that implies there is something the parties are not seeing.\n70/30 Rule - Ask open ended questions that leave the audience talking 70% of the time, while you are talking 30% of the time. Please note that this varies based on the type of meeting that you are conducting. Be conscious of what questions need to be asked and to capture those items.\nTake Notes - Effective note-taking is a valuable skill that will help you retain and recall any important details. Be the person who remembers all the details of your audience‚Äôs needs.\nAdapt to Audience Tone - Before going into the business portion of your meeting, evaluate first the tone of the audience. Adapt your tone accordingly in order to appeal to various types of personalities.\nMid-call - Half-way through the meeting, check in with your audience. Ask them what their thoughts are on the progression of this meeting and if what you‚Äôre presenting is on the right track. This helps both you and the audience by re-aligning expectations and making sure the meeting is going the right direction.\nPre-Close Summary - 10 Minutes (1-hour meetings) or 5 minutes (30 minute meetings) prior to ending the call, ask the audience to build out an agenda for the next step or meeting. This helps to secure next steps and to ensure there are no balls dropped.\nPost Meeting Action - Immediately write down notes and next steps and input into the proper directory (Google Drive, Salesforce, etc.).\nTwo Block Rule - For in person meetings with external parties you should wait until you‚Äôre more than two blocks from the meeting before discussing the results of the meeting. Nobody wants to hear themselves being discussed in the bathroom.\nCommunicating with media and industry analysts\nGitLab team members are not authorized to speak with the media or analysts on behalf of our company unless authorized by our Marketing department. Unless authorized, do not give the impression that you are speaking on behalf of GitLab in any communication that may become public. This includes posts to online forums, social media sites, blogs, chat rooms, and bulletin boards. This policy also applies to comments to journalists about specific matters that relate to our businesses, as well as letters to the editor and endorsements of products or services.\nFor more, please visit the\nCorporate Communications handbook section\n.\nPaid external speaking requests\nGitLab as the leader in all remote work creates opportunities for our team members to receive requests from external 3rd parties to participate on panels, blogs or news publication or articles. Recently our team members have been approached by external 3rd parties looking to pay or compensate GitLab team members for their time to discuss GitLab remote practice to help them guide a client. Other third parties may contact GitLab team members to provide subject matter expertise that they may have by virtue of their role at GitLab. As in any request we ask that team members verify who they are speaking with to make sure the source is indeed a valid and legitimate request. Always remember that you represent GitLab and if any question makes you uncomfortable or gives you a pause on whether you should answer then we recommend that you do not answer. A third party‚Äôs questions regarding GitLab financials, sales, compliance, executives or specifically where the company is heading should be treated with the most caution. We want and encourage all team members to be remote evangelists and this can be done without giving very specific information about GitLab. If you have any concern about a request please reach out on slack to\n#external-comms\nSocial media\nPlease see our\nteam member social media policy\n.\nPosting or streaming to YouTube\nSee the\nYouTube page\nfor options and instructions for posting recordings and live streaming to our YouTube channels.\nGuidelines for vendor meetings\nWe request external vendor meetings to use our video conferencing tool so we can quickly join the call and record the session if we need to. Confirm with vendor that they agree we can record the call. The DRI for the vendor meeting will generate the zoom link and share with the vendor.\nDecide ahead of the meeting who should be invited, i.e. those likely to get the most out of it.\nAhead of the meeting, we should agree internal agenda items/requirements/priorities and provide to the external provider.\nIn order to make the best use of time, we wish to avoid team introductions on the call, particularly where there are a number of us attending. We can include a list of attendees with the agenda and give it to the vendor before or after the meeting. Introductions can be helpful in some external calls. In those meetings, use\nthese guidelines\n.\nWhen a question or issue is raised on the agenda, if the person who raised it is present they will verbalize it live on the call; or if they are not present, then someone will raise it for them. This is a common GitLab practice.\nWhere possible, we request that the vendor provides their slides / presentation materials and any other related information after the meeting.\nDo not demo your tool live, create a pre-recorded walk-through of the tool and make it available to GitLab before the meeting so we can ask questions if needed.\nBe cognizant of using inclusive language.\nWe respectfully request that everyone is mindful of the time available, to help manage the call objectives effectively.\nUser communication guidelines\nKeep conversations positive, friendly, real, and productive while adding value.\nIf you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you‚Äôre posting to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post. Just make it clear that you have done so.\nThere can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You don‚Äôt need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.\nAssume positive intent\nand explicitly state the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says before you respond, not a weaker one that‚Äôs easier to criticize.\nRapoport‚Äôs Rules\nalso implores you to list points of agreement and mention anything you learned.\nAnswer questions, thank people even if it‚Äôs just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.\nAppreciate suggestions and feedback.\nDo not make promises that you can‚Äôt keep.\nDo not offer\nplatitudes\n. Be direct and respectful. For\nexample\n- we don‚Äôt need to suggest that our actions are because we ‚Äúheard feedback‚Äù when they are really done for other reasons.\nGuide users who ask for help or give a suggestion and share links.\nImproving Open Development for Everyone\n,\nTypes of requests\n.\nWhen facing negative comments, respond patiently and treat every user as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into\nthe strongest supporters\n.\nBy default, discussions in issues and MRs are public and could include participation of wider community members. It is important to make the wider community members feel welcome participating in discussions and sharing their view. Wider community members also submit\nMRs to help improve our website/handbook\nand this is often their first contribution to GitLab. We want to make sure that we are responsive to their contributions and thank them for helping improve GitLab.\nAdhere to the\nCode of Conduct\nin all communication. Similarly, expect users to adhere to the same code when communicating with the GitLab team and the rest of the GitLab community. No one should accept being mistreated.\nCompany phone number\nIf you need to provide the details of GitLab‚Äôs contact information you can take the\naddress from the visiting page\nfor reference; or the\nmailing address\nof the office in the Netherlands if that is more applicable.\nIf a phone number is required, leave this field empty by default. If that is not possible, then use\nthe general number (+1-415-761-1791), but be aware that this number simply guides to a voice message that refers the caller back to contacting us via email.\nEffective communication competency\nCompetencies\nare the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.\nIn an all-remote organization effective communication is key to exchanging knowledge, ideas, and information. Effective communication at GitLab:\nUses\nasynchronous\ncommunication as the starting point and stays as open and transparent as we can by\ncommunicating via text\nthrough public issues, merge requests, and Slack channels (over DMs).\nPlaces an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down ensuring a\nsingle source of truth\n.\nProduces video\nwhen necessary.\nIf you would like to improve your skills or expand your knowledge on topics relating to Communication at GitLab, check out our resources:\nCommunicating effectively and responsibly through text\nEmbracing asynchronous communication\nSkills and behavior of applying effective communication as a Team Member\n:\nEffectively practices communication via text.\nUses asynchronous communication when possible:\nmerge requests\n(preferred) or\nissues\n.\nDirects all communication to the appropriate channels (Slack, GitLab, email).\nRecognises when synchronous communication is the more appropriate option.\nDirects all decisions and discussions to the Handbook as a single source of truth.\nRecords videos to communicate information when that is the most efficient and effective way to consume the content.\nEmploys multimodal communication to broadcast important decisions.\nPractices low context communication and provides as much background as possible when communicating via text to avoid confusion.\nSkills and behavior of applying effective communication as a People Manager\n:\nImplements working asynchronously across teams, departments or across the company.

If in doubt, there‚Äôs an internal, GitLab University micro course on\n‚ÄòPrivileged communication‚Äô\n, which is relevant to any team member who communicates with the LACA team, seeking legal advice on behalf of GitLab. The training explains the legal protection which may be applied to certain communications between team members and LACA and how best to communicate in order to be protected.\nIt is also important to note that, if you receive any formal documents that appear to be legal notices, demands, subpoenas, court papers, or other potential litigation materials, you should please forward these by email to the legal team immediately (to the ‚Äô\nlegal@gitlab.com\n‚Äô email address) without responding yourself. Please add a brief note explaining when and how you received the document. These materials often have strict response deadlines, and your prompt sharing allows the legal team to review and address them properly to protect both you and GitLab.\nLast modified May 1, 2025:\nUpdate file employment-law.md (\n28f76b4e\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 760}

It means once you get travel approval it is on you to go get people to the event/meetings to create pipeline.\nTrip Notes\nThe ultimate purpose of attending any GitLab field event is to gain insight and add value. Sid Sijbrandij, our co-founder, talks about the importance of conferences and events\nhere\n. He believes the main goal of GitLab team participation should always be to connect with our customers and prospects and not to solely attend presentations. Trip notes are our internal process for tracking and capturing this data.\nWhy and When?\nTrip notes are required for the entire Commercial Sales Team anytime a team member travels for the company while working at GitLab. We believe it would be fun and valuable if you also shared trip notes when you traveled for personal reasons; however, that is up to your discretion.\nHow to properly document your trip notes?\nPlease follow the best practice process and use the\ntrip note template\nas a format to prepare for your future trip.\nTrip Notes Best Practice\nCommercial attendee will write up their notes in a google doc.\nPlease save your notes as GitLab internal read only for Commercial Team review in the\nCommercial Sales Drive Trip Notes Folder\n.\nOnce saved, please slack and share a link to your notes in the commercial_global_all channel to alert the team of your recent trip.\nFinally, please share your\nPost Trip feedback\nfor the entire company and the Field Marketing team directly in the specific Event Issue on the ‚ÄòPost Event Recap & Feedback‚Äô spreadsheet.\nGive Back Project\nWhat is the Give Back Project?\nThe Give Back Project is a self-selected opportunity to help the Commercial Sales team achieve better results. It is a finite project that, upon completion, is to be adopted by no less than 70% of the Commercial Sales team and used at least once a month.\nThe Give Back Project is assigned to all new Commercial Sales team members and is required to be completed as part of their on-boarding process.\nWhy is there a Give Back Project?\nThe goal of the Give Back Project is to allow new team members to be able to instantly contribute to the Commercial Sales team\nFosters GitLab‚Äôs values of collaboration and results\nThe Give Back Project gives team members the opportunity to be exposed to problems on the team today and will allow the team to look back and see how we addressed shortcomings in the past\nHow to properly document a Give Back Project\nGive Back Projects are described and worked by team members in the\nCommercial Sales issue tracker\nIf it is something that needs to be repeated (like a customer AMA) an associated handbook entry is created with a description on how a new person could achieve this\nAlthough the Give Back Project is designed to be finite, there is always room for iteration at GitLab. Be sure to include any necessary instructions on how a different team member would be able to add to your project if necessary\nExample Give Back Projects\nCustomer AMAs:\nMeetings for GitLab team members with current customers that provide an opportunity to ask them about anything in regard to their experience with GitLab\nCustomer Meetings:\nSharing the best practices for conducting any kind of external meeting at GitLab\nTrip Notes:\nallows team members who attend field events to track and capture data in order for the rest of the team to gain insight\nDoing Business with Partners/Channels:\nGuidelines on how to work with partners and resellers in order to ensure value is maximized in these areas\nHow to Handle New Customers After They Purchase:\nBest practices for handling new GitLab customers based on the scope of their purchase\nTechnical Evaluation of Customers:\nHow to properly evaluate a customer‚Äôs current technical environment in order to create organizational alignment and prescribe how GitLab can best solve their problems\nFor a complete list of our Give Back Projects and other Onboarding assignments our team is working on, please click the private link\nhere\n.\nPaid Time Off (PTO) and Results\nWe have found following steps beneficial to make the process of time off easy for Sales and keep business continuity.  This does not serve as a replacement to the company wide\nGuide to Paid Time Off\nor add process for\nSick Time Policy\n. This is the expanded approach to preparing yourself and the team for time off planned specific to the group.\nInform Manager as in the GitLab team members guide to time off\nAsk a regional team member for coverage and share planned time off\nSelect someone ideally in similar role and who has capacity to cover while OOO\nIt may be helpful to create a shared doc of action items, and follow reference from the handbook\nThere may be cases where double coverage or support from your manager is needed if no one else is available\nNote: For\nFamily & Friends Day\n, there is no need for backup coverage as it is a publicly visible shutdown for GitLab. Please message in your below OOO auto-reply as such including the handbook page, and contact details for technical support\nSubmit time-off in Time Off by Deel in Slack, and add your chosen team member who is covering for you as the assignee role for all tasks, you can label it something like ‚Äúimmediate and general‚Äù\nCreate calendar invite with title:\nEx: ‚ÄúFirst and Last Name OOO - (First and Last Name) is Covering‚Äù. Optional invite to your manager and person covering.\nBlock the morning of your return date on your calendar so you can return to work with catch-up time for things like:\nRe-submitting forecast in Clari\nRanking new accounts that came through\nRespond to email, support tickets, via Required 7\nOptionally schedule time on the return day to sync with the individual covering for you\nRole responsibilities to prepare being out of office\nAny quotes that are currently out to clients, resend via docusign with the person covering for you cc‚Äôd on them. Intro AE covering to client in case either have questions via email\nRun\nthis report\n, edit the\ndates\nfield in the top right corner to be the dates you are OOO, then select ‚Äòrun report‚Äô. Make sure ZERO next steps are falling on the dates you are out and cover anything not urgent before PTO. This will ensure you leave you without a huge workload for your backup or you in return.\nIf you have an urgent next step scheduled, reach out before vacation, inform the client you will be OOO and get either the person covering for you or your manager included by\ncc:\non the email w/ intro\nIf you have less urgent next steps approaching, assess if they should be handled before or after vacation and then edit the next steps date based on your assessment\nSet your email OOO auto-reply including the email of the person covering for you. If your manager is available the days you are out you can add them as well in the email message and any other urgent correspondence\nOn the day before time off:\nEnsure all required 7 reports are up to date\nSubmit forecast in Clari\nOptions on phone notifications related to work:\nEncouraged: Delete apps associated with work such as email and slack\nRecommended if it is difficult to get these apps back on your phone: Silence notifications on apps associated with work\nLeave your computer closed and have a blast!\nArea Sales Managers have additional steps to consider before leaving for time off:\nSet expectations on coverage for 1:1s and team meetings\nUpdating quote approval routing in SFDC to the person covering for you. Navigate to you name dropdown - My Settings - Personal - Approver Settings.  Search for the person covering next to Delegated Approver, confirm and select Save\nIn Navan, set Vacation Delegate in Settings - Account Details\nSubmit forecast\nIf planned time off exceeds the 25 consecutive days as outlined in the guide, request temporary ASM coverage for forecasting in Clari by submitting a request in the\nSales Operations\nproject.\nRole responsibilities of covering for a team member as backup\nRespond within 24 hours to the absent AE‚Äôs customers if they contact you.\nAddress new Required 7 items that appear on your team‚Äôs Required 7 dashboard for the absent AE.\nTake any urgent customer calls or BDR/SDR calls that have been set up. If you are not able to attend for any reason, you are expected to tell your manager so that appropriate backup can be found. Customer or prospect calls on the calendar should not be delayed or rescheduled.\nWork on and close deals in the absent AE‚Äôs territory while they are out.\nBackup AEs are not required to:\nCover tasks unrelated to the specific AE role. For example, if the absent AE is a member of a Team Member Resource Group (TMRG), you are not expected to attend TMRG meetings.\nOutbound campaigns to the absent AE‚Äôs customers (you can if you want to, of course).\nAgree to be a backup if you do not have time to do so, or cover multiple team members. There are other AEs who can help.\nForecast on behalf of the absent AE. Only update their opportunities as needed.\nRequired 7\nNew team members should familiarize themselves with\nThe Required 7\n. These are the 7 tactical skills required to be an excellent Commercial Sales Account Executive:\nRanking your accounts\n-\nvideo here\nRank all accounts and explain why; log your sources for future efficiency; this needs to be your (recent) ranking, not the previous owners, nor the ranking from the prior fiscal. If it‚Äôs unchanged, make the note that it is unchanged and why\nBuilding your (consider changing the deck)\ncustom deck\nfor any opp amount over $5k SMB $10k MM\nAmount\n(n.b. amount, not Net ARR) that:\nCalculates the ROI of using GitLab vs. next best option (this might be vs. do nothing)\nProvides the 2 options for the customer going forward - normally both with GitLab (example: Ult or Prem)\nDemonstrates a customised vision for the customer: ‚Äúwhat if you used all of GitLab to do DevOps in a single app?‚Äù\nCapture the full response, in the customers‚Äô words to that vision and the reasons why they think it is possible, or not possible. This capture can be done in the speaker notes so your customer can validate and then copied into an activity after the call.\nvideo here\n, and be sure to check out\nthis video\non creating an effective ROI slide deck and\nthis supporting deck\nCapturing key information:\nHow did the customer/prospect hear about GitLab and what is their understanding of what we do?\nMeaningful information on why we won/lost a deal\nLogging your\ncall notes\nvideo on taking efficient notes during a meeting\nand top tips from a top performer\nhere\nUpdating your next steps\n-\nvideo here\nCommand plans\n, what needs to be filled in:\n$5k SMB, $10k MM\nAmount\n- All fields in opportunity overview (the whys) and close-plan over this Amount threshold\n$10k SMB, $20k MM\nNet ARR\n- Full Command Plan over this Net ARR threshold\nIf you don‚Äôt yet know the answers or have the data, you will populate the Command Plan fields with your script and next steps to get that information\nException to command plan: for channel managed opportunities we may not have access - put\nChannel-Managed\nin the opportunity title\n(\ntraining session here\nand\ntraining deck here\n)\nKeeping your opportunities\nup to date at all times\nvideo\nAccount Ranking\nIt is a requirement for the Commercial Sales Team to tier their accounts using the fields on the Account Object. This helps prioritize the accounts to go after when prospecting for new or expansion. Please see below definitions specific to SMB and Mid-Market AEs.\nRanking Training and Definitions\nCommercial Sales: Account Ranking Training Clippet\nSMB Account Executive Definitions for Account Ranking\nRank 1: Top 10 Accounts with new business or upselling possibility within the next 12 months\nRank 1.5: Future opportunities that we should not lose track of as there is a sales opportunity here with no timeline\nRank 2: Believe there is an opportunity, but will take additional work before opening and beginning a sales cycle\nRank 3: Greenfield, SDR attention - perhaps a drip campaign\nSMB AE must have potential user field filled in on the account object for Rank¬†1, and 1.5\nSMB AE must have the notes section filled in on why an account is Rank¬†2 or 3\nMid-Market Account Executive Definitions for Account Ranking\nRank 1: Accounts that I am working to maximize their Net ARR this fiscal year.\nRank 1.5 The subset of Rank¬†2 that is best and trending toward being future Rank¬†1s.\nRank 2 Accounts that I am working to grow and I speak with them at least once a month.\nRank 3 Accounts that I keep informed about GitLab and DevOps monthly.\nClose Date Conventions\nFirst, forecasting, down to even the opportunity level, is a routine exercise for accuracy, not motivation or aspiration. Each week on Wednesday it is required to update five values in Clari by close of business (5 PM) local time.¬† This is Renewal Loss Best Case, Renewal Loss Best Case, Gross Net ARR Best Case, Gross Net ARR Commit, and Net 50/50.¬† At this time, it is required to double-check pipeline cleanliness and always follow the close date conventions listed here.\nThe close date should always be in the month that you believe it has the most likely chance of closing (with only one exception as dictated below).\nAt\nall times\nthe Net ARR amount should reflect your best estimate of the actual amount that the opportunity will have on it when it closes in the month reflected in the close date. There are no exceptions other than returning from an onsite visit, even if you have not spoken with the account. If you get a new opp you should quickly assess the account and, given your experience, make an educated guess on what amount the company will transact at.\nThe Stage represents where you believe the customer is in their buying process, not only the specific steps they have taken with you.\nThe three close dates:\nLast day of the month it will close in\nonly if you have a compelling event defined\nThe actual day the opportunity will close when the quote goes out for signature. It will appear past due if we don‚Äôt get the signature back and pushes to the Friday of the week it should close.¬† Renewals default to this convention\nFirst day of the following month, no compelling event defined\nPlacing the close date on the first day of the month is a temporary status of\nup to 48 hours\nduring which time the AE would work directly with their Champion / Economic Buyer to confirm the compelling event and client timeline.  Once determined, the AE would move the close date to the last day of the month of actual closing.\nThis close date carries a window of roughly 60 days of when you think it will come in\nExample\n: It‚Äôs April 23rd, a new business Mid-Market opportunity is identified for a company at 410 employees and growing at an unknown rate (unclear due to being an agency). The company completed their evaluation with a trial ending this month, there are defined problems initially trying to solve, with some people who have used GitLab before.\nQuestion for AE and self, what % chance of the purchase occurring in April, May, or June?\n90% April, 10% May\nChorus recordings\nA recording Chorus license is mandatory for all Commercial Account Executives. Our intent is to record customer calls for the following reasons:\nFor training, to make sure we are giving customers the best possible experience\nTo give to the customer as a visual record of our conversations with them\nTo verify any details we may have missed in the conversation\nMandatory steps required to record calls\nFollow instructions for using\nChorus Scheduler\nDeal Reviews\nProject 35\nAs we continue to grow as an organization, developing our sales skills to deliver an impeccable sales experience is a critical component of the customer experience, either leading them to enjoy working with GitLab or not, depending on the quality of that experience. We‚Äôve created a program called ‚ÄúProject 35‚Äù to help you improve your selling skills. We are utilizing our largest opportunities for the quarter to hone in our selling skills with the goal of these skills being valuable on all other sales opportunities.\nAs part of Project 35 we will be focusing on the following core selling skills:\nRunning excellent sales calls & importance of pre-call prep\nStronger discovery to uncover Command Plan (why now, why GitLab, why do anything at all)\nBuilding ROI\nFinding & cultivating champions\nNegotiation\nComplex Deal Management\nCollaboration - amongst peers and leadership\nPreparation for your next role & large deal management\nDuring a Project 35 call, The AE who is discussing their opportunity will answer the following questions:\nPrep for a no. What are all the questions or reasons they will say no?\nAre we building a relationship (onsite, something else?)\nNail the project name and the timing of the project (sell services)\nSelling against a ROI slide\nBased on the information uncovered in the prior questions, use supporting reasons for AEs to update their next steps live. Managers should enter their comments in the Manager Notes section for any deals they review live or asynchronously.\nEngage wider sales team. Who are, by name, the CSMs, SAs, Partners that are helping sell the deal. Please assign them to the discussion in the document so that they are able to join the call and contribute to the discussion.\nOpportunity Consults and Lightweight Deal Reviews\nAn\nOpportunity Consult\n(OCF) is an in depth, two-way conversation between the AE and the ASM to review the opportunity\nCommand Plan\n. The AE should expect to provide the ASM with more detailed information about the\nOpportunity Overview\nfields, the customer‚Äôs pain points and desired outcomes, challenges or gaps in qualification aligned to the\nopportunity qualification framework, articulate a\nClose Plan\nand identify the biggest opportunity risk(s) and action(s) to mitigate those risks.\nA Lightweight Deal Review (LDR) is a shorter (5-10 minute) deal review that is designed to identify gaps in the\nCommand Plan\nand specific next steps. At the end of an LDR, an AE and ASM should have a plan in place to capture the information that is not in the Command Plan, and a specific plan of action on and before the next call.\nOpportunity Next Steps Best Practices\nAlways keep Next Steps Date and Next Steps up to date as an assignment to a future version of yourself on how you will take action to continue the customers buying process.\nWhen you start your day you need to check all inputs like email, zendesk, and lead queue so you can triage those requests into your priorities for that day.\nAllocate times of your day in four ways:\nCustomer meetings scheduled\nProactive email and internal efforts\nProactive calling efforts\nTime to check inputs again\nWhen beginning a proactive time block, open your opportunities view and sort by Next Steps Date.\nYour Next Steps should be specific and compelling so that you can take action on them within 3 minutes of reading.\nNext Steps\nshould contain\nonly\nthe actions you will take next: no dates, no history, just the Next Steps\nWhen you update\nNext Steps\n, the\nNext Steps History\nwill automatically capture your prior\nNext Steps\n, applying a date stamp and storing them in reverse-chronological order\nPlease Note:\nIf you previously included history in the\nNext Steps\nfield, the next time you update\nNext Steps\nyou will need to clear the field completely and input only your Next Steps\nOpportunity-Specific Slide Deck\nIt is required that all opportunities above $10,000 (Mid Market) and $5,000 (SMB) in total amount (not Net ARR) will have a custom slide deck that is shared with the customer or prospect. The custom deck must be attached to the opportunity by pasting the deck link in the SalesForce field ‚ÄòLink to Custom Pitch Deck‚Äô on the opportunity home page. This will enable Mid Market Account Executives and SMB Account Executives to capture critical account information. Additionally, this will facilitate selling on value rather than features.\nCustom Deck Requirements\nVisual Requirements\nDeck‚Äôs main color will match or resemble that of the customer‚Äôs.\nWhere possible, use the customer‚Äôs logo.\nIt is appropriate to ask the customer for a blank template.\nCustomer Agreed-upon Agenda\nWhen meeting with the customer, leverage an agreed upon agenda to aide in co-selling.\nCalculated ROI of GitLab v. Next Best Option\nFor New Business the next best option could be ‚Äòdo nothing‚Äô or our competition.\nFor Renewals the next best option could be to go back to what they were doing before.\nTwo options (rough plans) with GitLab going forward\nFor new business this takes the form of\nTwo Lane Selling\nwhere we give them a high engagement and a low engagement option.\nFor a renewal, this could be a one year v. a three year option, or Premium v. Ultimate.\nNon-Custom Single Application pitch to the customer\nThis slide should have a visual representation of using GitLab as a single application for the entire software development life cycle.\nThe intent of this slide is to have the conversation with the customer on ‚Äòwhat is possible‚Äô, and to capture their feedback\nFull capture of the customer‚Äôs feedback on the ‚ÄòSingle Application‚Äô slide\nCapture the customer‚Äôs actual words in the speaker notes of the ‚Äòsingle application‚Äô slide\nRed / Green Process and Procedures\nRed / Green Purpose\nEffective ASM coaching of the why now, why do anything, why GitLab and specific next steps the Account Executive will take with the prospect/client. The goal of the red/green process is to accurately forecast which opportunities will close for each designated fiscal period (Month/Quarter). The red/green process is  meant to most acutely build skills around identifying the timeline that is most comfortable for the customer to close.\nRed / Green Definition\nDesignating each opportunity that has a shot to close at the end of each fiscal period as either Red (not going to close before the end of the month), or Green (going to close before the end of the month), and updating manager notes with a defense of the color and a specific next step the AE will complete by the next check in (usually the next day). For context, a green account will have a ‚Äúwhy now‚Äù that corresponds with a close before the end of the period.\n- The threshold (unless otherwise stated) for accounts that will be reviewed during Red/Green is:\n- SMB: $2,000 NetARR or greater\n- Mid-Market: $7,000 NetARR or greater\nRed / Green Tactics\nRed/Green meetings are held the 15th (or closest non-weekend day prior to the 15th) of each month, and the last five work days of the month.\nArea Sale Managers should conduct R/G meetings live with each of their Account Executives. This discussion should not be held asynchronously. Checklist of items below in this order. Advance to next question once prior is confident\nIs this opportunity Red or Green?\nWhy do anything at all?\nWhy GitLab?\nWhy now? (Is there a time-driven reason this opportunity will close within a specific time frame)\nWhat level is your closest relationship with?\nHow can they help you:\nGet accurate information on the ideal time for the customer to buy GitLab?\nGet you access to someone else in the organization who has access to the above information?\nWhat is the AEs immediate next step based on the answer to the items above? If anything less than ‚Äúwait for account to move from closing to closed-won‚Äù, then see ‚ÄúWhy Now‚Äù question.\nAn example of a specific next step would be to ask your closest contact: ‚ÄúIs this at all easier for you if we close this next month?‚Äù\nOnce Red/Green discussion is complete on the account, the ASM will enter notes in the ‚Äúmanager notes‚Äù section of the opportunity to reflect the discussion and the immediate next step the account executive will take.\nRepeat the same process the following date for all accounts above the threshold.\nRed / Green Outcome\nHit the forecast we commit to and build better sales skills for our AEs and better coaching skills for our ASMs.\n- Ideal skills that need to be built are:\n- Understanding the concepts and execution around knowing the ideal timeline the customer wants to close.\n- Identifying pain and having customers understand both the negative impacts of not switching to GitLab as well as the realized positive business outcomes by switching to GitLab.\n- Building a time-bound mutual success plan with the customer based on the severity or the ability for the customer to devote resources to a project.\nRed / Green Lookback Process\nAt the first R/G meeting of the following period, the leadership team will submit their actual closed-won for the prior period as well as their final R/G commitment. Team will then discuss the reasons why each finished where they did and identify any items that led to variation from commitment.\nSMB Account Executives\nSMB Account Executives ‚ÄúSMB AEs‚Äù act as Account Executives and the face of GitLab for\nprospects and customers. They are the primary point of contact for companies that employ between 1 to 99 employees.\nSMB Roles\nSMB Account Executives are designated into one of the following pod positions:\nFirst Order\nPooled\nExpand\nNamed\nSMB Account Executives in First Order will assist prospects in their evaluation through the first buying process. Depending on the account, the other three roles will be the customer‚Äôs primary point of contact for any renewal and expansion discussions.

Proper sales pipeline management helps you allocate your time correctly, increase deal velocity, and increase total deal volume, size, and revenue through accurate forecasting practices.\nA well-managed sales pipeline requires a clear process with defined activities and exit criteria that serve as a roadmap to getting a deal from discovery to closed won (or qualified out quickly). The following process is specific to the Commercial Sales team and will ensure you have a clean pipeline and accurate forecast.\nDetailed Exit Stage Criteria Google Sheet\nExit Criteria at a Glance\nPlease read through the\nCommercial Sales Opportunity Stages handbook page\nfor more information.\nWeb Direct Oppty Management in Salesforce\nFind the report view for all CFQ ‚Äúcurrent fiscal quarter‚Äù Web Direct purchases in your territory ‚ÄúSMB_Web Directs CFQ_name‚Äù:\nCheck that there are no open opportunities that could have been a duplicate by viewing the opportunities listed under the Account\nIf not a duplicate, place the main contact in the opportunity on the outreach sequence ‚ÄúSMB_Web Direct Outreach‚Äù - by: Madeline Hennessy\nDependent on the opportunity and company if personal outreach is preferred, you must log your activity and have a next step date to follow up on your activity\nLicensing/Subscription Management\nNote: if you need access to a system,\nopen an Access Request\nGitLab Trials & Subscription Management\nAccess\nthe CustomersDot\nto provide changes to a user, group, or subscription.\nTroubleshooting & How-To Resources for Licensing & Subscription Management\nDetailed instructions on how to handle problems with licenses and subscriptions can be found in\nthese instructions and resources.\nMore information about\nsales order processing\ncan be found in the Business Ops handbook section.\nMid Market Account Executive\nMidmarket Account Executives are the primary point of contact between prospective and existing customers of GitLab within a space defined as mid-market, which currently works with companies that employ between 100 to 1,999 employees. These GitLab team members manage the spectrum of project sizes, ranging from small fast growing teams in smaller agile organizations to complex enterprise projects advising on the journey with GitLab to achieve specific business outcomes.\nMid-Market AEs work closely in tandem with the business development team and sales management to manage a broad book of business spread over a large opportunity value range and focus on exceeding client expectations.\nMid Market Roles\nNew Logo AE\n: These AEs work on the\nBase Accounts\nthat are not currently customers of GitLab. Once the customer has signed its first contract, the customer is transitioned to the SMB, MM, or ENT segment depending on the size of the customers.\nMM Key Accounts Named AE\n(MMKAN): These AEs work on current customers that have been deemed to be high spending (high CARR) or have the potential to be high spending (high LAM). To be successful the MMKAN AE must expand their accounts more than the standard expansion rate for their named list of accounts. The named list for each MMKAN AE will grow through the fiscal year as the MMKAFO AE wins new high potential customers.\nMM Territory AE\n: These AEs work geographic regions of accounts that have not been vetted to be New Logo AE or MM Key Account named AE. The role sells to both prospects and current accounts.\n‚ÄúMM Key Accounts‚Äù can be used to refer to MM Key Accounts First Order and MM Key Accounts Named collectively.

Tag your Area Sales Manager when research is complete for further review by @ mentioning them. If the ASM has reviewed the data provided by the Account Executive as well as doing their own due diligence and is unsure of the rules of engagement, they should screenshot their research, post it on the account in chatter and tag the Regional Director for review by @ mentioning them. Finally, if a Regional Director is unsure of the rules of engagement after reviewing the data provided and doing their own due diligence, they should screenshot their research, post it on the account in chatter and tag the Regional Vice President for review and final decision. All final decisions for Commercial account and opportunity ownership are up to the sole discretion of the Regional Vice President of the Commercial Division.\nAccounts who became customers on or after February 1st of the fiscal year\nAccounts will be separated into the following categories\nSales Assisted First Order\nWeb Direct First Order\nFor sales assisted first orders, it is the responsibility of the account executive who conducts the initial discovery with the prospect to research and qualify the number of employees and headquarter location for the account.\nIf the account has less than 100 employees the account will be managed by SMB for the remainder of the fiscal year\nIf the account 100 employees or greater the account will be managed by Mid Market for the remainder of the fiscal year\nIf the account has greater than 500 employees or greater than 100 LAM dev please see the Rules of Engagement Between MMKAFO and Mid-Market Territory for FY ‚Äò23 for proper lead routing\nFor web direct first orders we understand there may be a degree of differentiation of actual employee count versus what our systems capture based on the tools utilized to enrich data. It is the responsibility of the Account Executive who owns the first order to identify the correct number of employees after the web direct first order and ensure that the employee count is not ‚Äúwholly wrong‚Äù. Wholly wrong is used only for accounts that upon initial assignment are assigned by automation i.e. no team member reviewed them at first transaction.\nWholly wrong is defined as the following\nMid Market owned accounts with less than 80 employees\nSMB owned accounts with greater than 120 employees\nIf an account is wholly wrong, it is the responsibility of the account owner to chatter @sales-support to reassign the first order and the account to the correct segment.\nIf an account is not wholly wrong but above or below the segment line (respectively) is it the responsibility of the account owner to chatter @sales-support to flag the account to move to the appropriate segment at the beginning of the following fiscal year.\nAll accounts that are not researched or identified as being assigned to the wrong segment will be reassigned.\nIf the AE qualifies this and then keeps it, this can lead to disciplinary action.\nAs part of the qualification process tt is expected to qualify the location of company headquarters and employee count so we can best support the customer. It is not acceptable to qualify location and employee count in a manner that jeopardizes the customer experience. If you are unsure, always tag your manager in chatter to review the data before involving the customer.\nRules of Engagement Between MMKAFO and Mid-Market Territory for FY ‚Äò23\nFiscal Year 2023 Account Moves\nFor all accounts that are in SalesForce.com as of February 24, 2022 the Mid-Market Key Accounts First Order team will own all accounts that are:\nSegmented to Mid-Market NORAM or EMEA\nMarked as ‚ÄúFirst Order Available‚Äù in SalesForce\nHave a full time employee count of 500 employees or greater as marked in the ‚ÄúAccount Demographic Max Family Employees‚Äù field under Account Demographics in SFDC.\nHave a potential user count of 100 users or more as measured by the LAM Dev Count Field.\nTo avoid confusion the logic is\n[1 AND 2 AND (3 OR 4)]\n.\nNote: If an AE suspects that the employee count or potential user count is not accurate in our data sources, it is the AEs responsibility to uncover the employee count and potential user count during the discovery phase. If an account is identified to belong to either territory or First Order and the other party continues to work the lead without doing proper due diligence, the account will be reassigned to the appropriate party.\nNew Accounts to SalesForce.com after Feb 24, 2022\nFor all\ninbound\nMQLs for which an account does not yet exist in SalesForce.com, the routing of that lead and account will be based exclusively on employee count.\nIf the account has 500+ employees it will be routed to the MMKAFO team\nIf the account has less than 500 employees it will be routed to the Mid-Market Territory team\nMMKAFO AEs are able to go\noutbound\nto accounts that are not yet in SalesForce.com that fit the criteria in the Mid Market Key Accounts definition:\nMid-Market accounts that have either 500+ employees OR 100 potential users as defined by LinkedIn Engineering + IT personnel count.\nMMKAFO AEs are able to create the outbound accounts in SFDC that fit the above criteria, and ask Sales Operations to move the account into their name.\nNote: If it is found out that an AE asks for an account to be deduplicated in order to work said account, disciplinary action will be taken.\nAccount Moves Throughout Fiscal Year 2023\nIf an MMKAFO AE finds out through discovery that a sub 500 employee account segmented to First Order in reality has less than 100 potential users, they should immediately ask for the account to be moved to Territory.\nIf a ‚ÄúFirst Order Available‚Äù account is segmented to Territory, and the Territory AE finds out through discovery that the account actually has more than 500 employees, they should immediately ask for the account to be moved to First Order.\nThe automation for new accounts in the system means accounts with under 500 employees but over 100 potential users will be routed to territory and left there unless they have no activity at the quarter change over.\nIf it is found out that an AE intentionally ignores rules number 1 or 2 more than twice in a fiscal year disciplinary action is likely to be taken.\nCo-Selling\nCo-selling is the responsibility of both the Account Executive and their Area Sales Manager to join sales calls together. This is to ensure the best client/prospect experience, along with jointly finding the highest potential within that account.\nArea Sales Managers have an expectation to log a minimum of 5 co-selling calls per rolling 7 days, although we are aiming to achieve closer to 10-12 calls over a rolling 7 days.\nCo-Selling Roles when working with your ASM\nPrimary Seller: Consider this role as the main pitch person. You are directing the conversation, sharing the deck and taking live notes and adding value, while also keeping on track with the agenda decided upon.\nCo-Seller: This individual is responsible for raw notes in Salesforce, time management, and digging into comments to identify areas where we should be finding additional information. The Co-pilot should be digging into levels and amounts of pain when the Pilot moves on without capturing this.\nFor additional information please visit this\nreinforcement module\nWorking with Channel Partners\nThe GitLab partner network is ready to work with GitLab Account Executive‚Äôs in order to extend the customer selling and services capacity offered by Commercial Sales. Channel‚Äôs approach to this is called Partner Co-selling and working with Partners involves building a simple, clear, mutual customer opportunity plan establishing ‚Äúwho will do what, when?‚Äù.\nWhat are the key benefits from working with partners?\nAEs Working with Partners for Increased Customer Value & Net ARR\nExtended reach and capabilities via Partner sales and services capacity and reach via GitLab-trained Partner AE‚Äôs, SA‚Äôs, Engineers, and often a GitLab channel manager to coordinate/assist.\nAccelerated reach to new customer logos ‚Äú\nLand\n‚Äù: Partners are beginning to bring GitLab new logo opportunities via mining their customer base. In many cases, Partners already have a ‚Äútrusted Partner status‚Äù with their customers, which also serves to accelerate new logo engagements.\nIncreased customer ‚Äú\nExpand\n‚Äù success: In many cases, Partners will sell and deliver the key services called for to ensure customers get the maximum value from their GitLab technology investment and drive stage advance along with user growth.\nDeployment and related services: For faster delivery and increased capacity, AEs are turning to Partners to sell and deliver these services, also CSM-like customer success services.\nIn the case of OPEN partners via distributors, dramatic reduction in the admin steps associated with quote-to-order process.\nHow do AEs work with partners for increased customer value & Net ARR?\nGitLab has a mature Partner network with good coverage of GitLab-trained Sales and Technical resources. There are a few ways in which AEs will work with a customer including a Partner.\nApproved Partner GitLab Deal Registrations\nAs these are received in your territory, in most cases* you will be contacted by a GitLab channel team member to arrange a co-selling kickoff call to develop a simple Partner co-selling plan to share with the Partner. GitLab Channel Managers do not proactively manage all OPEN Partners. AEs can always request Channel Manager support for a Deal Registration by slacking channel-sales or available contacts.\nIf you find themselves thinking 1. ‚Äúa Partner SA could execute on this customer-requested SA task‚Äù, or 2. AEs have customers that could benefit from a ‚ÄúPartner services attach engagement‚Äù, reach out on slack\n#channel-sales\nwith a Partner engagement request, if possible with a link to the related account or opportunity. A member of the channel team will promptly reach out to learn more about the request, and connect you with a Partner that is pre-qualified to promptly and properly execute on the task at hand, and keep you updated along the way.\nAEs should lead planning and execution of the joint opportunity/customer pursuit with alignment and support of the partner and GitLab Channel Manager. The plan should be\ntracked in SFDC with tasks and action items\n. Partners should always get an email confirmation of any tasks assigned to them (via AE or Channel Mgr).\nChannel Managers will engage with AE‚Äôs in the following ways:\nWhen a new deal registration arrives in the AE‚Äôs pipeline\nTo review 2-3 Partners for the AE to work with for AE-selected joint customer success motions:\nThe Channel Manager will bring the possibilities forward during this call\n2 examples of working with Partners are featured in\nthis LevelUp\nAEs should share their thoughts about prioritizing which Partner activities would be best for which of their customers\nIn the case of Open partners via distributions, when the opportunity is ready, AE‚Äôs email\npartnersupport@gitlab.com\nwith the link to the opportunity requesting quote-to-order support (chatter alias coming soon)\nResources to learn more about teaming with Channel Partners?\nIf this is a first time for an AE, we recommend watching the available training delivered.

Below are the responsibilities of the New Logo team and the Mid-Market Key Account Named team.\nWhen to Pass an Account Mid-Market or Enterprise\nNew Logo AEs will own an account until an account becomes a paid customer. Once this happens, the account will graduate into their respective segment (SMB, MM, or ENT).\nHandover Process\nNew Logo AE Responsibilities\nPlease refer to the\nNew Logo Team Playbook\nfor additional information about the role and responsibilities.\nEnsure the opportunity is marked as ‚ÄòClosed-Won‚Äô.\nEnsure the customer has a working license.\nLog an activity (naming convention: [NL AE NAME] NL Account Summary for Handoff)  on the account level detailing the following:\nWhy the account chose GitLab (use case)\nThe expected NetARR to be sold in the next 12 months\nEstimated timeframe of the next purchase\nWhy you believe b and c to be the case\nWork with the Named or Territory AE, the CSM (if known), and the customer to set up a handoff call\nNew Logo AE should take the lead on scheduling this call\nNote\n: Should the NL Rep and Named or Territory AE agree ahead of time that an email introduction will suffice, then the team can bypass the handoff call.\nIf the initial amount AND the potential of the next opportunity are less than a combined NetARR of $10,000, or the inheriting AE agrees, a handoff email can be used.\nEnsure all material like custom decks are added into a dedicated customer sub-folder in the\nCustomers & Prospects\ndrive.\nCreate a sub-folder in one of the folders labeled A-Z based on the first letter of the customer account name. (Example: Acme Inc. would go in the folder labeled ‚ÄúA‚Äù)\nAdd all customer facing or internal documents related to that customer into the folder. This way the entire Account Team will be able to view all related content.\nFor Web Directs without prior engagement :There will be no handover as the FO AE has not had any engagement.\nDigital Sales Room\nA Digital Sales Room is a secure, personalized webpage where AEs can share curated content, collaborate with prospects, and track buyer engagement throughout the sales process. It centralizes all sales materials, presentations, and communications in one branded space, eliminating scattered emails and creating a seamless buyer experience.\nDigital Rooms - Highspot Overview Training\nDigital Rooms 101\nEngage Buyers with Digial Rooms\nNamed/Territory AE Responsibilities\nWork with the New Logo AE, CSM, and customer to schedule a handoff call (or email).\nThe goal should be to have two-way communication with the customer within one week of the initial close.\nIf an email is used, the Named or Territory AE should respond at their earliest convenience to introduce themselves as the new primary point of contact\nLook at the account activities for the activity logged by the FO AE.\nBased on the above notes, open a growth opportunity if scheduled before the first renewal date\nRead through all notes tagged (ii), the custom pitch deck, and the command plan to gain an understanding of the account and its potential.\nEngage the CSM on strategic accounts and get them engaged asap\nFor Web Directs: It is the responsibility of the Named/Territory AE to reach out to the new customer.\nProcess to Move Accounts From Base to Named/Territory\nPlease refer to the\nGo-To-Market Rules of Engagement\npage for additional information about account graduation for the New Logo Team.\nWhen to Consider Involving a Named or Territory AE Before the Initial Deal is Done\nThere may be situations where it is beneficial to either GitLab, the Prospect, or both to introduce the Named or Territory AE before the initial deal closes. These situations include, but are not limited to:\nExtra support is needed for a strategic account.\nA CSM may need to be engaged before the initial contract is signed.\nAn onsite meeting may need to happen and the Named/Territory AE is in a better geographical location to handle it.\nThe customer has asked to be introduced to who will handle their account after the initial contract is signed.\nGeneral Guidelines to Follow When Making this Consideration\nIt is always the decision of the New Logo AE to determine if an introduction should be made pre-contract signature, but there are some general best practices to follow if an introduction is to be made.\nIdeally, pre-contract introductions would be limited to higher LAM accounts, so this does not become a scale issue.\n99 LAMDev for Key Accounts\n->49 LAMDev for Territory Accounts\nIn an effort to not waste Named/Territory AEs time, an introduction should not be made unless there is a very high close percentage. Therefore, an introduction is best if made when the opportunity is in\nstage 5 or 6\n.\nNamed/Territory AEs and New Logo AEs should meet often (every other week on average) to identify accounts where a pre-contract introduction would make sense.\nCommercial Leadership Development Pilot Program\nThis pilot program is for Commercial team members interested in learning more about Sales management and building foundational leadership skills.\nThis program is designed to give team members:\nExposure to leadership topics and development of foundational leadership skills\nLeadership frameworks that they can modify and apply to their teams\nExperience with the expectations of a sales leader and how that differs from an individual contributor role\nOpportunity to network with peers and other cross functional stakeholders\nThe program will run for a total of\n8\nweeks;  each week focusing on a new topic.

HelpLab is monitored during most working hours and is the centralized support platform for all people-related queries. Read more about our\nPeople Connect methods of engagement\n.\nWe trust team members to always use their best judgement when facing any emergency. Team members are encouraged to dial their country‚Äôs emergency services number for any critical and/or medical emergency. In the case that other team members are aware of a team member‚Äôs emergency (during a Zoom call for example) and wish to call that country‚Äôs emergency services on the original team member‚Äôs behalf, we do not recommend this as only certain People Ops team members have access to team member addresses and we would take on the role of communicating with emergency services, should this extremely rare situation arise.\nIn the event a team member is in an unsafe situation due to a natural disaster, please see the\nDisaster Recovery Plan\npage.\nHow to Report Violations\nAs stated in the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n, we have a section related to reporting violations. GitLab has engaged Navex to provide EthicsPoint, a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool, an anonymous ethics hotline for all team members. The purpose of the service is to insure that any team member wishing to submit a report anonymously about conduct addressed in the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\ncan do so without the fear of retaliation.\nIn addition to EthicsPoint, GitLab has engaged Lighthouse Services to provide an anonymous reporting hotline for all team members to submit reports regarding team member relations. Reports may cover but are not limited to the following topics: wrongful discharge or disciplinary action,\nsexual harassment\n, discrimination, conduct violations, alcohol and substance abuse, threats, improper conduct, violation of company policy.\nPlease note that the information provided by you may be the basis for an internal and/or external investigation into the issue you are reporting and your anonymity will be protected by Lighthouse to the extent possible by law. However, your identity may become known during the course of the investigation because of the information you have provided. Reports are submitted by Lighthouse to a company designee for investigation according to our company policies.\nLighthouse has a toll free number and other methods of reporting are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for use by team members.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.lighthouse-services.com/gitlab\nUSA Telephone:\nEnglish speaking USA and Canada: 833-480-0010\nSpanish speaking USA and Canada: 800-216-1288\nFrench speaking Canada: 855-725-0002\nSpanish speaking Mexico: 01-800-681-5340\nAll other countries telephone: +1-800-603-2869\nE-mail:\nreports@lighthouse-services.com\n(must include company name with report)\nFax: (215) 689-3885 (must include company name with report)\nIn addition to EthicsPoint and Lighthouse, please review the\nTeam Member Relations\npage.

The goal of these pages is to ensure that team members and People Managers can plan ahead and have an overview of upcoming programs and timelines.\nCommunication on People Programs that require action\nEach quarter a Slack reminder will go out in #people-manager-and-above channel to review the next quarter calendar events. Each month shows Task, which outlines the people manager responsibility associated with the specific program, and (if applicable) highlights the Key Date. We will also leverage our Manager Newsletter and the Company Newsletter for broadcasting our programs widely.\nUpdating calendars\nEach month on the first Monday there‚Äôs a calendar reminder to update the calendars on that date. This calendar reminder includes People Business Partners and the DRI in L&D.\nAlso with sharing the calendars in the news letters People Business Partners and L&D will be tagged.\nThe goal of the calendar is to include information at least two quarters ahead of the current quarter. For questions about the updates to the calendars you can always reach out to People Connect.\nSupport provided by the Legal, Employment team to the People Group\nThe Legal-Employment team, collaborates with and provides support to the People team in many functional areas.\nEmail approval from the Senior Director of Legal, Employment is required prior to engagement with external counsel to allow for accurate tracking of costs.\nInvoices will be sent to Senior Director of Legal, Employment, for approval.\nWhen support from the People Operations team is required by the Legal, Employment team\nThe Legal, Employment team may require support from the People Operations team, for communicating a country specific legal requirement to team members, to consult with team members in an entity country if necessary or to arrange legally required contract amendments, to name just a few examples. As these matters may relate to individual team members or groups of team members, they are appropriately managed in a confidential manner.\nIf the Legal, Employment team makes a request for support or assistance from the People Operations team, the request should be formulated using a template (\nlinked here\n, though accessible internally only to Legal, Employment and the People Operations team).\nThe request should include\nall\nthe required detail and explanation to enable people connect to support, including:\nAn explanation of what is needed\nWhether there‚Äôs a timeline on the request (ensuring people connect are provided with as much lead time as possible)\nWhether all the information needed, has been provided, eg contact names, dual language translations if applicable, links to any relevant documents etc\nA note on whether an FAQ to share with team members is needed or whether people connect have enough information to answer any questions which might arise\nWhether there are any follow up actions for legal or for people connect\nA short explanation or summary (if necessary) or courtesy update for the managers of any affected team members\nWhether confirmation of completion is needed\nTo make a request, a copy of the template should be saved, filled out as above, dated and passed to Alissa Meeks/the People Operations Manager so the request can be assessed and assigned to a member of the people connect team for completion. Once assigned, the member of the People Operations team who will be assisting with the request should touch base with the member of the Legal, Employment team who has made the request, to confirm that the request is being worked on and so it‚Äôs easy to collaborate on finishing out the task.\nSupport provided by the People Operations team to the People Business Partner team\nMost tasks/requests from the People Business Partners for the People Operations team will be handled via a HelpLab. If a general query/question, the PBP may request guidance in the private\n#pbp-peopleops\nSlack channel. This is a private channel. The People Operations Team, will self-assign a task, within 24 hours and comment in Slack/HelpLab on the request to confirm.\nPeople Operations Responsibilities & Response Timeline\nPlease note that the source of truth for role responsibilites is the job family for the\nPeople Operations Team\n. The table below is meant to provide a quick overview of some of the core responsibilities for the team.\nPeople Operations Team\nResponsibility\nResponse Timeline\nOnboarding\n2 weeks prior to start date\nOffboarding\nImmediate action for involuntary & 24 hours for voluntary\nOrganizational Changes\nWithin 3 days of effective date of change\nLetters of Employment\nWithin 24 hours\nEmployment Verification\nWithin 24 hours\nAnniversary Emails\nFirst day of the following month\nHelpLab Queries\nWithin 24 hours\nProbation Period Notifications\nDaily (when applicable)\nContract Renewals\n30 days or more prior to team member‚Äôs renewal date\nExit Interviews\nDuring voluntary offboarding team member‚Äôs last week\nUS Unemployment Claim Management\nAs Needed and Audited Quarterly\nRelocations\nAs requested, usually completed 30 days or more prior to team member‚Äôs relocation date\nOther listed processes for the People Connect Team can be found\nhere\nEmployment Solutions Team\nResponsibility\nResponse Timeline\nCountry Conversions\nAs soon as approval is given by CFO.

The page includes information on accessing a team directory, requesting a letter of employment, mortgage forms, the companies reference request policy, ordering business cards, and changing your name in GitLab systems.\nAddresses\nFor the mailing addresses, see our\nvisiting\npage.\nFor the NL office, we use\naddpost\nto scan our mail and send it to a physical address upon request.\nReporting potential inaccurate LinkedIn Profiles\nGitLab does not actively search for LinkedIn profiles that have inaccurate information about being a GitLab Team member. However, there are instances where a profile is identified and there is question on whether the person is truly a GitLab team member. Here is the process for flagging a potentially inaccurate profile and the actions that the People Connect Team will do to confirm and potentially report a profile.\nTeam members should first check in Slack and/or on the organizational page to determine if the team member is a current GitLab team member.\nIf the team member cannot confirm the profile, team members should reach out to the People Operations Team via\nHelpLab\nwith the LinkedIn profile in question.\nThe People Operations team member will confirm in Workday that they are not/have not been a team member.\nThe People Operations team member will confirm with talent acquisition to confirm if they have ever been interviewed, made an offer or were declined.\nThe People Operations team member will reach out to the\nDeveloper Relations team\nto confirm if they are an active wider community member via the\n#developer-relations\nSlack channel, using the\n@devrel-team\ntag.\nIf they are a confirmed member of the wider community but not a team member, the Developer Relations team will reach out the profile and ask them to change their profile to match their GitLab involvement.\nIf they are not a current member of the wider community and talent acquisition has confirmed they do not have a profile in Greenhouse, talent acquisition will create a Do Not Hire profile.\nThe People Operations team member will report the account to LinkedIn via the\nReporting Inaccurate Information on Another Member‚Äôs Profile\nUsing Workday\nWe use Workday to maintain team member information.  All team members (all contract types) are in Workday.\nWorkday is managed and maintained by the People Tools and Technology team.\nSee our\nWorkday Guide\nto  learn more about how to use Workday.\nUsing Culture Amp\nAdministrative access to CultureAmp will be limited based on role and responsibility. There are 3 different levels of access:\nAccount Administrator access can manage account setting and team member data, create surveys and has access to all survey results.\nSurvey Creator administrator access can create, manage and design surveys, select participants and share results.\nSurvey data analyst administrator can export raw data from all surveys enabled for raw data extract.\nTo request access please open an access request with the type of account\naccess requested\nand the business need. You can assign the access request to Anesia Chan\n@anechan\nand Laura Janssen\n@Laura-Janssen\n(as backup) for review and approval. The default admin access will be the Survey Creator administration rights unless other access is specified. Please note that Survey Data Analyst admin rights will not be granted to team members outside of the People group with out permission from the Chief People Officer.\nIf you need support with a specific CultureAmp Survey, please complete this\nissue template\nto alert the People Analytics Team.\nTake Time Out to Learn\nAt GitLab, we believe that\ncareer growth is non-linear\n. In practice, non-linear career growth is an opportunity for team members to increase efficiency with new skills, develop as leaders with new responsibilities, and grow as an expert in their field.\nBut growth only happens when we make intentional time and space to learn.\nAs a People Group, we‚Äôre embracing this attitude of continuous learning together, with the challenge that, as a team, we can spend a total of\n300 hours\nlearning before the end of FY25 Q3! We encourage everyone to participate, spending approx. 2 hours per month learning something new, as a way to prioritize your development and use work time to uplevel and upskill.\nAt the end of the quarter, we‚Äôll ask folks to self-report hours spent learning, and take a tally of total People Group learning hours.\nHere are a few ways you might spend time learning this quarter:\nCreate an IGP\nto track and monitor your growth goals\nUtilize the\nGrowth and Development Fund\nto engage in a class or conference\nOrganize a\njob shadow\nor\ninternship for learning\nto increase exposure and collaboration with different roles and teams.\nAttend an AMA or async Group Conversation, and contribute by asking a question.\nOrganize a discussion on your team about a shared topic (i.e. article, book, or podcast on a topic that is relevant to your team‚Äôs work)\nAttend a TMRG career growth event\nWe encourage everyone to have an ongoing conversation about career growth with their manager during weekly 1:1s. If this isn‚Äôt already part of your weekly check in, consider adding it to your agenda template now!\nInvesting in your growth is essential for both your individual success and the success of our entire team.

Docsy GitLab is included in both handbook sites.\nwww-gitlab-com\nis the source repository of data files used by both handbook sites.\nhandbook\nis the public handbook site.\ninternal-handbook\nis the internal handbook site.\nTemplates and Partials\nReview the Hugo development documentation to learn more.\nhttps://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/\nhttps://gohugo.io/functions/partials/\nThere are some\npartials specific to GitLab\n.\nAccess tokens\nTo minimize maintenance, a small number of group and project access tokens are used.\nThis overview is not meant to be a comprehensive list. Search in this and other development documentation pages for details on the individual access tokens.\n, currently called\nDocsy GitLab Release\n. Used for various things, primarily:\ndocsy-theme\nrelease\njob\nnotify\nhandbook jobs\n, currently called\nTriage bot\n. Used for various maintenance tasks, primarily:\nTriage\nCI jobs in\nmaintenance-tasks\nProject access tokens are sometimes created for project specific tasks, such as\n.\nA ‚Äúzap‚Äù\n(internal) (use shared 1Password sign in) has been configured with a group level webhook to notify the\n#handbook-escalation\nchannel. Due to its reliability, you may want to consider creating an issue, or some other reminder.\nHandbook monitoring\nThe\nhandbook monitor project\nruns a pipeline every 10 minutes (see pipeline schedule) to check if the handbook is ‚Äúup‚Äù using\nhurl\n.\nThere is another scheduled monthly pipeline that will rebuild the image used in CI. This job will only run if there‚Äôs an environment variable\nset to\nto avoid rebuilding the image with every scheduled CI job.\nIf the job fails, the pipeline will post to the\n#handbook-escalation\nSlack channel.\nNotices are also posted in that channel when pipelines fail on the\nmain\nbranch of the handbook projects.\nNote: Internal handbook is not monitored in this way as there is a blocking issue. See\ninternal-handbook#90\n.\nSimilarly, the request for\nintegrating the handbook to infra‚Äôs monitoring\nis pending. See\ndocsy#14\nfor more information.\nRun the handbook locally for edits\nSupported methods:\nDocker or compatible runtime (all software preinstalled in a container image)\nLocal installation (experienced users, more software dependencies, can break)\nRequirements\nCommand line:\ngit\n,\nwget\n(for syncing data). Additional requirements for local installation, see below.\nDocker or compatible runtime (for running the Hugo environment in a container)\nOn\nmacOS\n: Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, etc.\nOn\nLinux\n: Docker engine, Podman, etc.\nClone the handbook Git repository\nCloning the repository allows you to manually edit the handbook locally. If you prefer to use the Web IDE, please continue reading the\nediting the handbook\ndocumentation.\nWe recommend using git to clone the repository and then editing the handbook with a text editor such\nas\nVisual Studio Code\n,\nTypora\n,\nNova\nor\nSublime\nto name a few.\nClone the repository:\nPublic handbook\n:\ngit clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook.git\nInternal handbook\n:\ngit clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-com/content-sites/internal-handbook.git\nDocsy GitLab theme\n:\ngit clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-com/content-sites/docsy-gitlab.git\nSet up the repository\nAfter cloning the repository, sync the required data files from the\ndata file location (currently the\nwww-gitlab-com\nrepository).  Without this\nstep, the handbook cannot be run locally.\nOpen a terminal, navigate into the cloned handbook repository path, and run the\nsync-data.sh\nscript.\nExample for the public handbook:\ncd\nhandbook\n./scripts/sync-data.sh\nRunning Hugo\nHugo needs to be run to generate the static files from the handbook markdown content.\nWhen installing Hugo, review the CI file of the relevant handbook repository for the version of Hugo in use. The latest version may or may not work.\nThere are two ways to run Hugo:\nRunning the Handbook in Docker\nRunning the Handbook Locally\nParameters for Hugo\nThe handbook is huge, and by default, the\nhugo server\ncommand loads everything to memory.\nThe following options for the\nhugo\ncommand can be helpful for debugging or otherwise running locally:\n--environment=production\n: generate a production build (asset minification, checksums, etc)\nNote:\nhugo v0.x.x+extended\nversion must be installed, use\nhugo version\nto check\nNote:\nnpm i\nmust be run as a prerequisite to install\npostcss\nand\nautoprefixer\ndependencies\n--renderToDisk\n: slower but requires less memory to run. Useful if you have less than 16GB allocated to docker machine\n--verbose\n: enables verbose logging output\n--templateMetrics\nand\n--templateMetricsHints\n: prints metrics related to how frequently templates are invoked and how much time is being spent evaluating them\n--printMemoryUsage\n: periodically prints memory usage while the site is building\nBuild static files\nTo render the entire site to disk (and inspect the output in\n${PWD}/public\n),\npurge the generated files first, and then run Hugo.\nmake clean\ndocker run --rm -v\n$(\npwd\n)\n:\n$(\npwd\n)\n-w\n$(\npwd\n)\nhugomods/hugo:exts hugo\n# or\nhugo\nPermissions\nFor some pages to render you may need a\npersonal access token\n.\nGenerate one and export it as an environment variable prior to running\nhugo\ncommands:\nexport\nHUGOxPARAMSxGITLAB_API_KEY\n=\n\"<token>\"\nhugo ...\nIf you need to make changes to the underlying theme you‚Äôll need to make changes in the\nGitlab-Docsy\nmodule\n.\nLinting content\nTo enforce rules and guidelines, we use:\nCustom Handbook lint\nHugo lint\nmarkdownlint\nVale\nOnce an error is encountered, the relevant job fails and a comment is added to the merge request with a list of errors, with guidance for the suggested fix.\nWarnings and suggestions are not reported in the comment, but are in the code quality report.\nCurrently, all configuration and script files exist in each repository. See\nconfiguration file sync issue\n.\nHandbook lint\nThe custom handbook lint script (\nhandbook version\n) is used to verify a number of the guidelines we have, including:\nMedia files\nImage location for new images.\nImage size for images in the MR.\nVideo location for new videos.\nCodeowners\nFolder or file exists.\nA controlled document is listed in the\n[Controlled documents]\nsection, and vice versa.\nA required approval includes the specified groups, such as\ne-group\n.\nWarns if a listed user is not in the\nteam.yml\n.\nNote: If a user exists, but the job says they‚Äôre not a team member, check the relevant\ndata/team-member.yml\nfile to see if the GitLab username matches.\nHugo lint\nWe use\nHugo lint\nto check for the validity of internal links. It supports relative linking to the markdown file, and the production path.\nEach job also outputs the top 30 incorrect links to assist in fixing them.\nSee the ReadMe for more information about how Hugo lint works.\nmarkdownlint\nRefer to the\nmarkdown guide\nfor style guide information, and guidance on rules.\nWe use\nmarkdownlint-cli2\nin our pipelines with a slightly customized set of rules.\nBefore pushing any changes, you can run\nmarkdownlint-cli2\nand fix any suggested changes to avoid pipeline failures.\nTo run\nmarkdownlint-cli2\nusing Docker, run:\ndocker run --rm -v\n$(\npwd\n)\n:\n$(\npwd\n)\n-w\n$(\npwd\n)\ndavidanson/markdownlint-cli2 content/**/*.md\nIf you have\nmarkdownlint-cli2\ninstalled locally\n, you can run the command in the relevant repository.\nThis method is recommended when editing the config file (look for the\nmarkdownlint\nfile), and testing the changes. To have markdownlint automatically fix some errors,\nadd the fix option:\nmarkdownlint-cli2 --fix\n\"content/**/*.md\"\nRules are configured to be close to the\nGitLab documentation markdownlint\n, without some of the stricter styling rules.\nThe relevant rules are also noted in the\nmarkdown guide\n.\nVale\nWe use\nVale\nto verify some of the rules in the\nHandbook Markdown Guide\n.\nVale errors will fail the pipeline and are included in the MR comment.\nWarnings are included in the job log, code quality, and MR diff.\nTo run Vale using Docker, run:\ndocker run --rm -v\n$(\npwd\n)\n:\n$(\npwd\n)\n-w\n$(\npwd\n)\njdkato/vale content\nIf you have vale installed locally, you can test the changes. To limit the results, add the\nminAlertLevel\noption, such as:\nvale --no-wrap --minAlertLevel error --glob\n=\n'{content,assets,layouts}/**/*.md'\n.\nRules are configured to be close to the\nGitLab documentation vale rules\n.\nWhen the\ngitlab_base\nrules are exactly the same, they are included in the\ngitlab_base\nfolder in the content sites repositories.\nWhen the rules differ, they are stored in the\nhandbook\nfolder.\nDocsy GitLab Theme Development\nDocsy\nis used as a base for the internal and public handbooks. Modifications\nand extensions have been added on top to ensure efficient handbook usage.\nAll Hugo partials and shortcodes should be added to this repository, instead\nof duplicating them locally into the handbook projects.\nThe\nDocsy GitLab theme\nis integrated into the public/internal handbook repositories using a Go module in\ngo.mod\n.\nLocal Development\nTo develop on the Docsy GitLab theme locally build the handbook (or internal-handbook) project with the updated local copy of the docsy-gitlab theme following the steps below:\nAdd the following line to the bottom of the\ngo.mod\nfile in the handbook project:\nreplace\ngitlab\n.\ncom\n/\ngitlab\n-\ncom\n/\ncontent\n-\nsites\n/\ndocsy\n-\ngitlab\n=>\n/\ndocsy\n-\ngitlab\nRun the Hugo server:\nhugo server\nLoad the site locally:\nopen http://localhost:1313/\nAny changes made to files in local\ndocsy-gitlab\nproject will be rendered in the local instance.\nTesting changes\nWhen making changes that may have a user impact (not content only changes):\nTest the changes\nlocally\nfirst by performing the upgrades to\ngitlab-docsy\n,\nhandbook\n, and\ninternal-handbook\nand running the builds locally. Manual testing locally will make it easy to spot any major issues.\nIf there are no concerns, create a MR in the Docsy project with the changes, and have a maintainer review. Ensure that only the relevant changes you‚Äôre testing are in the MR.\nNote: At the moment, there is no review app for the\ndocsy\nproject. When relevant, include local testing notes in the MR.\nWith the new version of the theme available, create new MRs in\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\nwith the changes and upgrade to the theme if needed. Use review apps for both MRs to test the dependency changes in a production-like environment.\nApply the changes to the internal handbook first, and ensure changes are okay.\nNext, apply the changes to the public handbook.\nIf there are any issues, revert the changes to the handbook projects.\nReleases\nChanges made to\ndocsy-gitlab\nwill be made available to the\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\nafter the version is bumped and deployed to each project. This includes all theme updates with partials, shortcodes, and any changes to\n/docs\n. Much of this process has been automated, but a few manual steps are still required. To release a\ndocsy-gitlab\nchange follow these steps:\nAfter the merge request is merged, a pipeline on the\nmain\nbrach will kick off. After the pipeline succeeds, the\nrelease\njob can be triggered manually. For example:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/docsy-gitlab/-/pipelines/1304430830\nThe release job will do three things:\nCreate a release in the\ndocsy-gitlab\nproject. Example:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/docsy-gitlab/-/releases/v0.3.25\nCreate a merge request to\nhandbook\n. Example:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/merge_requests/6086\nCreate a merge request to\ninternal-handbook\n. Example:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/internal-handbook/-/merge_requests/4771\nAssign a\nhandbook backend maintainer\nor codeowner to each MR for review.\nOnce the merge request to\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\nhave been merged, the theme changes will be deployed to the sites.\nFor more information on the release process, see the\nrelease script\n.\nDependencies\nUpdating dependencies\nNote: Before updating dependencies, review the\ngo.mod\nfile in the target\nproject for additional notes and requirements.\nAlways update dependencies individually to isolate potential bugs and regressions. Never pull\nlatest\nbut pin the dependencies to a specific released version.\nhugo mod get server.com/project-name@version\nGoogle Docsy\nhugo mod get github.com/google/docsy@v0.9.1\nDo not bump Docsy versions without testing them extensively in MR review apps.\nRedirects\nYou can add redirects to the\nlayouts/index.redirects\nfile in the relevant repository.\nRefer to the\nGitLab Pages redirect documentation\nfor how these are formatted.\nPlease add your redirect in chronological order with a removal date of:\n3 months for within a single handbook, from one relative path to another relative path,\n3-6 months when linking from one handbook to another (such as linking from\nhandbook.gitlab.com\nto\ninternal.gitlab.com\n), or\n3-12 months for external links, meaning not part of the\nhandbook.gitlab.com\nor\ninternal.gitlab.com\ndomains.\nCI/CD Pipelines\nHandbook & Internal Handbook\nThe CI/CD pipelines for the\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\nprojects are roughly the same, and should remain that way.\nbuild\nstage\nThe\nbuild\nstage performs a few linter and security jobs (\nhandbooklint\n,\nhugolint\n,\nmarkdownlint\n, and\nsecret_detection\n), and a\nbuild\njob which builds the whole site and saves it as CI artifacts.\ndeploy\nstage\nThe\ndeploy\nstage uses the artifacts generated in the\nbuild\nstage to deploy the production site for changes to the\nmain\nbranch or review apps which can be deployed for MRs.\nnotify\nstage\nThe\nnotify\nstage has two jobs that are triggered on specific events:\npost_comment_on_failure\nposts a comment to the MR when the\nmarkdownlint\nor\nhandbooklint\njobs fail.\nnotify_slack_on_build_failures\npost a message to the #handbook-escalation Slack channel when there is a build failure on the\nmain\nbranch. This type of failure would indicate a broken CI pipeline.\nmode\nThe pipelines can be triggered to run in\nmode which means they will run all the test and build jobs, but none of the deploy or notify jobs. A pipeline can be triggered in\nmode by setting the\nCI variable to\ntrue\n. This is used primarily by the downstream pipelines triggered from the\nwww-gitlab-com\nproject.\nTools or scripts that need to interact with the repositories to perform handbook tasks should use the\nCI variable. This is\ngroup level access token\ncalled\nDocsy GitLab Release\nwith a\ndeveloper\nrole and has\napi\nand\nwrite_repository\nscopes. This token will expire after a year and will need to be refreshed. Follow the steps below to refresh the token:\nCreate a new developer group level access token in <https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/content-sites/-/settings/access_tokens with api> and\nwrite_repository\nscopes. Give it the name\n(replace the\nportion with the current date).\nUpdate the value of GITLAB_TOKEN in\ndocsy-gitlab\n,\nhandbook\n, and\ninternal-handbook\nwith the new token value.\nCreate a new release of the Docsy GitLab Theme and ensure the pipeline works correctly.\nDelete the old token.\nSee above for more on\ngeneral management of access tokens\n.\nGitLab Pages Deployment\nThe deploy and review apps are configured in the\npages\njob in the\n.gitlab-ci.yml\nconfiguration file.\nReview app deploys can be run for merge requests by running the manual\npages\njob, or by adding the\n~\"deploy-review-app-always\"\nlabel to the MR.\nProduction deploys are only run from the\nmain\nbranch.\nConditional CI variables are used to configure the environment for review apps using\nGitLab Pages Multiple Deployments\n.\nvariables\n:\n'mr$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID'\n:\n'mr$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID'\n:\nThe\nroute map\nis configured in the\n.gitlab/route-map.yml\n.\nDocsy GitLab\nThe CI/CD pipeline for\ndocsy-gitlab\nis responsible for building, testing, and releasing the Docsy GitLab theme used by both\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\n.\ntest\nstage\nThe\ntest\nstage performs the\nmarkdownlint\n, and\nsecret_detection\njobs.\nbuild\nstage\nThe\nbuild\nstage performs runs the\nhugo\ncommand to ensure the theme builds successfully.\nrelease\nstage\nThe\nrelease\nstage performs one manual job to create a new release of the theme and merge requests to both\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\n. See the\nReleases\nsection for more details.\nwww-gitlab-com\nThe CI/CD pipeline for\nwww-gitlab-com\nis responsible for triggering downstream builds of both\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\nin\nmode. This ensures that any changes to dependent data files in\nwww-gitlab-com\nwill build successfully for both\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\n.\nDanger review and reviewer roulette\nRight now the handbook projects doesn‚Äôt use the\nReviewer Roulette\nfeature of the\ndanger-review\nCI/CD component\n. See\nissue\n.\nWe use the\narchitecture\nplugin to provide guidance on how to review MRs that contain changes to\narchitecture evolution design documents\n.\nIn order to make Danger post message to MRs we need to setup a project token (\napi\nscope with\nDeveloper\nrole) and\na CI/CD variable called\nto contain this project token (\nMasked\nbut not\nProtected\n).\nSee above for more on\ngeneral management of access tokens\n.\nFor more details, follow the\nDanger documentation\nand inspect the\nMR adding the reviewer roulette to the public handbook\n.\nCode quality report MR commenter\nThe CI/CD linting jobs generate code quality report artifacts for MR widget integration. If there are errors detected,\na custom CI/CD job posts a Markdown table summary as MR comment, linking to helpful handbook editing resources.\nThe\nparse-codequality-report.sh\nscript in the\nhandbook\nand\ninternal-handbook\ngenerates the code quality report posted in the MR. Changes to these reports need to be applied to both projects.\nThe code quality report relies on the\nto perform the reporting actions on any MRs.\nCI/CD maintenance tasks\nSee\nmaintenance tasks\n.\nTriage bot\nThe\ntriage-bot\nproject is meant to help triage issues in the handbook, internal-handbook, and docsy-theme projects.\nIt has two main goals:\nEnsure issues are triaged.\nClose stale issues and merge requests.\nPlease see the\n.triage-policies.yml\nfor rules.\nYou can find more about how to create policies in the\nGitLab triage gem project readme\n.\nThe triage bot is scheduled to run 3 times a week. See the project‚Äôs pipeline schedule for details.\nTriage uses the\naccess token to perform tasks. This must have the Developer role to take actions on merge requests.\nSee above for more on\ngeneral management of access tokens\n.\nHandbook Maintenance\nDocumentation on how to carry out maintenance tasks.\nRunning the Handbook in Docker\nInstructions for running the Handbook projects in Docker\nRunning the Handbook Locally\nInstructions for running the Handbook projects locally\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 3086}

When deciding whether an MR should be reverted,\nthe following should be true:\nSomething broke and there is no acceptable work around. Examples of this include:\nA feature broke and is categorized as\n~severity::1\nor\n~severity::2\n.\nSee severity labels\nMaster broken\nThere are failing migrations\nThere are no dependencies on the change. For example, a database\nmigration has not been run on production.\nReverting merge requests that add non-functional changes and don‚Äôt remove any existing capabilities\nshould be avoided in order to prevent designing by committee.\nThe intent of a revert is never to place blame on the original author. Additionally, it is helpful\nto inform the original author so they can participate as a DRI on any necessary follow up actions.\nThe\npipeline::expedited\nlabel, and\nmaster:broken\nor\nmaster:foss-broken\nlabel must be set on merge requests that fix\nmaster\nto skip some non-essential jobs in order to speed up the MR pipelines.\nBroken\nmaster\nIf you notice that pipelines for the\nmaster\nbranch of\nGitLab\nor\nGitLab FOSS\nare failing, returning the build to a passing state takes priority over everything else development related, since everything we do while tests are broken may:\nbreak existing functionality\nintroduce new bugs and security issues\nimpede productivity for all of engineering and our release processes\nWhat is a broken\nmaster\n?\nA broken master is an event where a pipeline in\nmaster\nis failing.\nThe cost to fix test failures increases exponentially as time passes due to\nmerged results pipelines\nused. Auto-deploys, as well as monthly releases and security releases, depend on\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nmaster being green for tagging and\nmerging of backports\n.\nOur aim should be to keep\nmaster\nfree from failures, not to fix\nmaster\nonly after it breaks.\nAny question or suggestion is welcome in the\n#g_development_analytics\nchannel who owns the broken\nmaster\nautomation proceess.\nBroken\nmaster\nservice level objectives\nThere are two phases for fixing a broken\nmaster\nincident which have a target SLO to clarify the urgency. The resolution phase is dependent on the completion of the triage phase.\nPhase\nService level objective\nTriage\n4 hours from the 2nd occurrence of a broken\nmaster\nincident creation until assignment\ngroup labeled on the incident\nResolution\n4 hours from assignment to DRI until incident is resolved\nMerge request author or team of merge request author or dev on-call engineer\nNote: Recurring incidents are negatively impacting master pipeline stability and development velocity. Any untriaged, recurring incident will be automatically escalated to\n#dev-escalation\nfollowing this timeline:\ntimeline\ntitle Pipeline incident escalation\nsection Pipeline failure incident #1\nnot recurring in 24 hours and no human activity : Auto closed\nany human update on incident #1\n: labels incident #1 with escalation skipped\n: does not trigger any group ping or escalation\nsame job failures recurring in incident #2\n: closes incident #2 as duplicate of incident #1\n: labels incident #1 with escalation needed\n: pings attributed group channel after 10 minutes of inactivity\n: 2nd ping to group channel after 30 minutes of inactivity\n: pings stage channel in after 3 hours 40 minutes of inactivity\n: escalates to dev-escalation after 4 hours of inactivity\n: labels incident #1 is escalated\nIf an incident becomes a blocker for MRs and deployments before being auto-escalated, the team member being impacted should refer to the\nbroken\nmaster\nescalation\nsteps to request help from the current\nengineer on-call\nas early as needed.\nAdditional details about the phases are listed below.\nBroken\nmaster\nescalation\nRecurring broken\nmaster\nincidents are automatically escalated to\n#dev-escalation\nunless it is triaged within 4 hours.\nIf a broken\nmaster\nis blocking your team before auto-escalation (such as creating a security release) then you should:\nSee if there is a non-resolved\nbroken\nmaster\nincident\nwith a DRI assigned and check discussions there.\nCheck discussions on the failure notification in the triage DRI‚Äôs group Slack channel to see if anyone is investigating the incident you are looking at. See\nTriage broken master\nfor information on who the triage DRI is.\nIf there is not a clear DRI or action to resolve, use the\ndev escalation\nprocess to solicit help in the broken\nmaster\nincident.\nEscalation on weekends and holidays\nMaster broken incidents must be manually escalated to\n#dev-escalation\non\nweekends and holidays\nif necessary. Without a manual escalation, the service level objective can extend to the next working day; that is, triage DRI is expected to triage the incident on the next working day. Regardless of when the label was applied, we always consider an incident to be in an\nescalated\nstate as long as it has the ~‚Äúescalation::escalated‚Äù label, until the incident is resolved.\nTriage broken master\nDefinitions\nFlaky test: A test that fails, then succeeds when the CI job running the test is retried.\nBroken master:\nA test that fails even when the CI job running the test is retried.\nA failing test that can be reproduced locally on the\nmaster\nbranch.\nAttribution\nIf a failed test can be traced to a group through its\nfeature_category\nmetadata, the broken\nmaster\nincident associated with that test will be automatically labeled with this group as the triage DRI through\nthis line of code\n. In addition, Slack notifications will be posted to the group‚Äôs Slack channel to notify them about ongoing incidents. The triage DRI is responsible for monitoring, identifying, and communicating the incident.\nA notification will be sent to the attributed group‚Äôs Slack channel and\n#master-broken\n.\nTriage DRI Responsibilities\nMonitor\nPipeline failures are sent to the triage DRI‚Äôs group channel, if one is identified, and will be reviewed by its group members. The failures will also be sent to\n#master-broken\nfor extra communication. If an incident is announced in a DRI group‚Äôs Slack channel, the channel member should acknowledge it and assume the triage DRI responsibilities.\nIf the incident is a duplicate of an existing incident, use the following quick actions to close the duplicate incident:\n/assign me\n/duplicate\n#<original_issue_id>\n/copy_metadata\n#<original_issue_id>\nIf the incident is not a duplicate, and needs some investigation:\nAssign the incident to yourself:\n/assign me\nChange the incident status to\nAcknowledged\n(in the right-side menu).\nIn Slack, the\n:ack:\nemoji reaction should be applied by the triage DRI to signal the linked incident status has been changed to\nAcknowledged\nand the incident is actively being triaged.\nIdentification\nReview non-resolved\nbroken\nmaster\nincidents\nfor the same failure. If the broken\nmaster\nis related to a test failure,\nsearch the spec file in the issue search\nto see if there‚Äôs a known\nfailure::flaky-test\nissue.\nIf this incident is\ndue to non-flaky reasons\n, communicate in\n#development\n,\n#backend\n, and\n#frontend\nusing the Slack Workflow.\nAnnounce that\nmaster\nis fixed by enter\n/broadcast master fixed\nin the chat bar of the\n#master-broken\nchannel to invoke this workflow, and then click\nContinue the broadcast\n.\nCreate a revert MR directly\nto save some time in case we need to revert down the line.\nIf you are reverting an MR that performs a database migration, you need to follow the\nDeployment blockers process\nto prevent the migration from proceeding to deploy and running on staging and production.\nIf the migration is executed in any environments, communicate to the release managers in\n#releases\nchannel and discuss whether it‚Äôs appropriate to create another migration to roll back the first migration or turn the migration into a no-op by following\nDisabling a data migration steps\n.\nIf you identified that\nmaster\nfails\nfor a flaky reason\n, and it cannot be reliably reproduced (i.e. running the failing spec locally or retrying the failing job):\nQuarantine\nthe failing test to restore pipeline stability within 30 minutes if the flakiness is continuously causing master pipeline incidents.\nAlternatively, if the failure does not seem disruptive, and you have a fix that you are confident with, submit the fix MR with the ~‚Äúmaster:broken‚Äù label to ensure your pipeline is expedited.\nIf a flaky test issue already exists, add a comment in it with a link to the failed broken master incident and/or failed job. We have automation in place to create test failure issues automatically. The issue is named after the spec path, which can be a search keyword.\nIf a flaky test issue doesn‚Äôt exist, create an issue from the\nNew issue\nbutton in top-right of the failing job page (that will automatically add a link to the job in the issue), and apply the\nBroken Master - Flaky\ndescription template.\nAdd the appropriate labels to the main incident:\n# Add those labels\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::flaky-test\"\n/label ~\n\"failure::flaky-test\"\n# Pick one of those labels\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::dataset-specific\"\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::datetime-sensitive\"\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::state leak\"\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::random input\"\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::transient bug\"\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::unreliable dom selector\"\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::unstable infrastructure\"\n/label ~\n\"flaky-test::too-many-sql-queries\"\nClose the incident\nAdd the stacktrace of the error to the incident (if it is not already posted by gitlab-bot), as well as Capybara screenshots if available in the job artifacts.\nTo find the screenshot: download the job artifact, and copy the screenshot in\nartifacts/tmp/capybara\nto the incident if one is available.\nIdentify the merge request that introduced the failures. There are a few possible approaches to try:\nCheck the commit in the failed job, and find the associated MR, if any (it‚Äôs not as simple most of the times though).\nLook at the project activity\n, and search for keywords in the recent merged events.\nLook at the recent commits on master\nand search for keywords you might see in the failing job/specs (e.g. if you see a\ngeo\nspec file is failing, specifically the\nshard\nspec, search for those keywords in the commit history).\nYou can\nfilter with the\nMerge branch\ntext\nto only see merge commits.\nLook at the spec file history or blame views, by clicking respectively the\nHistory\nor\nBlame\nbutton at the top of a file in the file explorer, e.g. at\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/backup.rb\n.\nIf you identified a merge request, assign the incident to its author if they are available at the moment. If they are not available, assign to the maintainer that approved/merged the MR. If none are available, mention the team Engineering Manager and seek assistance in the\n#development\nSlack channel.\nYou can find the team somebody is in and who‚Äôs the manager for that team by searching in\nhttps://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/\n.\nIf no merge request was identified, ask for assistance in the\n#development\nSlack channel.\nPlease set the appropriate\n~master-broken:*\nlabel from the list below:\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::caching\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::ci-config\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::dependency-upgrade\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::external-dependency-unavailable\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::flaky-test\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::fork-repo-test-gap\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::pipeline-skipped-before-merge\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::test-selection-gap\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::need-merge-train\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::gitaly\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::state leak\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::infrastructure\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::infrastructure::failed-to-pull-image\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::infrastructure::frunner-disk-full\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::infrastructure::gitlab-com-overloaded\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::job-timeout\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::multi-version-db-upgrade\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::missing-test-coverage\"\n/label ~\n\"master-broken::undetermined\"\n(Optional) Pre-resolution\nIf the triage DRI believes that there‚Äôs an easy resolution by either:\nReverting a particular merge request.\nMaking a quick fix (for example, one line or a few similar simple changes in a few lines).\nThe triage DRI can create a merge request, assign to any available maintainer, and ping the resolution DRI with a\n@username FYI\nmessage.\nAdditionally, a message can be posted in\n#backend_maintainers\nor\n#frontend_maintainers\nto get a maintainer take a look at the fix ASAP.\nIf the failures occur only in\ntest-on-gdk\njobs, it‚Äôs possible to stop those jobs from being added to new pipelines while the cause is being fixed. See the\nrunbook\nfor details.\nPro-tips for Triage DRI\nFor an initial assessment of what might have contributed to the failure, we can try the experimental AI-assisted\nroot cause analysis\nfeature following\nthis documentation\n.\nTo confirm flakiness, you can use the\n@gitlab-bot retry_job <job_id>\nor the\n@gitlab-bot retry_pipeline <pipeline_id>\ncommand to retry the failed job(s), even if you are not a project maintainer.\nNote\n, The\nretry_job\ncommand can fail for the following reasons:\nRetrying the same job twice with the\nretry_job\ncommand will result in a failure message because each failed job can only be retried once.\nIf there is no response to either of the\nretry\ncommands, you are likely invoking them in non-supported projects. If you‚Äôd like to request for the commands to be added to your project, please\nmake an issue\nand inform\n#g_development_anallytics\n. You are encouraged to self-serve the MR following\nthis example\nand submit it for review for maximum efficiency.\nResolution of broken master\nThe merge request author of the change that broke\nmaster\nis the resolution DRI.\nIn the event the merge request author is not available, the team of the merge request author will assume the resolution DRI responsibilities.\nIf a DRI has not acknowledged or signaled working on a fix, any developer can take assume the resolution DRI responsibilities by assigning themselves to the incident.\nResponsibilities of the resolution DRI\nPrioritize resolving recurring broken\nmaster\nincidents over new bug/feature work. Resolution options include:\nDefault\n: Revert the merge request which caused the broken\nmaster\n. If a revert is performed,\ncreate an issue to reinstate the merge request and assign it to the author\nof the reverted merge request.\nReverts can go straight to maintainer review and require 1 maintainer approval.\nThe maintainer can request additional review/approvals if the revert is not trivial.\nThe\npipeline::expedited\nlabel, and\nmaster:broken\nor\nmaster:foss-broken\nlabel must be set on merge requests that fix\nmaster\nto skip some non-essential jobs in order to speed up the MR pipelines.\nQuarantine\nthe failing test if you can confirm that it is flaky (e.g. it wasn‚Äôt touched recently and passed after retrying the failed job).\nAdd the\nquarantined test\nlabel to the\nfailure::flaky-test\nissue you previously created during the identification phase.\nCreate a new merge request to fix the failure if revert is not possible or would introduce additional risk. This should be treated as a\npriority::1\nseverity::1\nissue.\nTo ensure efficient review of the fix, the merge request should only contain the minimum change needed to fix the failure. Additional refactor or improvement to the code should be done as a follow-up.\nThe resolution DRI must address all failures in the pipeline. Be mindful that the initial opened issue for the incident will only announce the jobs that failed so far. But after you fix those jobs, other subsequent jobs could fail on the same pipeline that you‚Äôre triaging. The triage DRI is responsible for this whole pipeline, and not only for the initial failed jobs.\nApply the\nPick into auto-deploy\nlabel (along with the needed\nseverity::1\nand\npriority::1\n) to make sure deployments are unblocked.\nIf the broken\nmaster\nincident affects any stable branches (e.g.\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25274\n) or is caused by a flaky failure,\nopen new merge requests\ndirectly against the active stable branches\nand ping the current release manager in the merge requests to avoid\ndelays in releases / security releases.\nSee\nHow to fix a broken stable branch guide\nfor more details.\nCommunicate in\n#master-broken\nwhen the fix was merged\nOnce the incident is resolved, select the\nBroadcast Master Fixed\nworkflow in the\n#master-broken\nchannel, and click\nContinue the broadcast\nto communicate it.\nWhen\nmaster\nbuild was failing and the underlying problem was quarantined /\nreverted / temporary workaround created but the root cause still needs to be\ndiscovered, the investigation should continue directly in the incident.\nCreate an\nissue\nfor the\nDevelopment Analytics group\ndescribing how the broken\nmaster\nincident could have been prevented in the Merge Request pipeline.\nWhen resolution steps are completed and all of the required fixes are merged, close the incident.\nResponsibilities of authors and maintainers\nOnce the resolution DRI announces that\nmaster\nis fixed:\nMaintainers should start a new merged results pipeline (for canonical MRs)\nand enable ‚ÄúAuto-merge‚Äù.\nThere‚Äôs no need to rebase once\nmaster\nhas been fixed since we use\nmerged results pipelines\n.\n(For forks only) Authors should rebase their open merge requests (since\nmerged results pipelines\nisn‚Äôt supported in these cases).\nMerging during broken master\nMerge requests\ncan not be merged\nto\nmaster\nuntil the incident status is changed to\nResolved\n.\nThis is because we need to try hard to avoid introducing\nnew\nfailures,\nsince it‚Äôs easy to lose confidence if it stays red for a long time.\nIn the rare case where a merge request is\nurgent\nand must be merged\nimmediately\n, team members can follow the process below to have a merge\nrequest merged during a broken\nmaster\n.\nCriteria for merging during broken master\nMerging while\nmaster\nis broken can only be done for:\nMerge requests that need to be deployed to GitLab.com to alleviate an ongoing production incident.\nMerge requests that fix broken\nmaster\nissues (we can have multiple broken\nmaster\nissues ongoing).\nHow to request a merge during a broken\nmaster\nFirst, ensure the latest pipeline has completed less than 2 hours ago (although it is likely to have failed due to\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nusing\nmerged results pipelines\n).\nNext, make a request on Slack:\nPost to either the\n#frontend_maintainers\nor\n#backend_maintainers\nSlack\nchannels (whichever one is more relevant).\nIn your post outline\nwhy\nthe merge request is\nurgent\n.\nMake it clear that this would be a merge during a broken\nmaster\n, optionally add a link to this\npage in your request.\nInstructions for the maintainer\nA maintainer who sees a request to merge during a broken\nmaster\nmust follow this process.\nNote, if any part of the process below disqualifies a merge request from being merged\nduring a broken\nmaster\nthen the maintainer must inform the requestor as to\nwhy\nin the\nmerge request (and optionally in the Slack thread of the request).\nFirst, assess the request:\nAdd the\n:eyes:\nemoji to the Slack post so other maintainers know it is being assessed.\nWe do not want multiple maintainers to work on fulfilling the request.\nAssess whether the merge request\nis urgent or not\n. If in doubt, ask the requestor for more\ndetails in the merge request about why it is urgent.\nNext, ensure that all the following conditions are met:\nThe latest pipeline has completed less than 2 hours ago (although it is likely to have failed due to\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nusing\nmerged results pipelines\n).\nAll of the latest pipeline failures also happen on\nmaster\n.\nThere is a corresponding non-resolved\nbroken\nmaster\nincidents\n.\nSee the ‚ÄúTriage DRI Responsibilities‚Äù steps above for more details.\nNext, add a comment to the merge request mentioning that the merge request will be merged\nduring a broken\nmaster\n, and link to the broken\nmaster\nincident. For example:\nMerge request will be merged while\n`master`\nis broken.\nFailure in\n<\n>\nhappens in\n`master`\nand is being worked on in\n<\n>\n.\nNext, merge the merge request:\nIf the ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù button is enabled (this is unlikely), then click it.\nOtherwise, you must:\nUnset the\n‚ÄúPipelines must succeed‚Äù setting\nfor the\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nproject\n.\nClick the ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù button.\nIf the merge train is enabled, a warning will be displayed stating the code changes won‚Äôt be validated by the merge train. Considering the criticality of the merge request it is acceptable to dismiss the warning.\nSet the ‚ÄúPipelines must succeed‚Äù setting to be on again.\nBroken\nmaster\nmirrors\n#master-broken-mirrors\nwas created to remove duplicative notifications from the\n#master-broken\nchannel which provides a space for\nRelease Managers\nand the\nDeveloper Experience teams\nto monitor failures for the following projects:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab\nhttps://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ee\nThe\n#master-broken-mirrors\nchannel is to be used to identify unique failures for those projects and flaky failures are not expected to be retried/reacted to in the same way as\n#master-broken\n.\nBroken JiHu validation pipelines\nWe run JiHu validation pipelines in some of the merge requests, and it can be\nbroken at times. When this happens, check\nWhat to do when the validation pipeline failed\nfor more details.\nSecurity Issues\nSecurity issues are managed and prioritized by the security team. If you are assigned to work on a security issue in a milestone,\nyou need to follow the\nSecurity Release process\n.\nIf you find a security issue in GitLab, create a\nconfidential issue\nmentioning the relevant security and engineering managers, and post about it in\n#security\n.\nIf you accidentally push security commits to\ngitlab-org/gitlab\n, we recommend that you:\nDelete the relevant branch ASAP\nInform a release manager in\n#releases\n. It may be possible to execute a garbage collection (via the Housekeeping task in the repository settings) to remove the commits.\nFor more information on how the entire process works for security releases, see the\ndocumentation on security releases\n.\nRegressions\n~regression\nimplies that a previously\nverified working functionality\nno longer works.\nRegressions are a subset of bugs. The\n~regression\nlabel is used to imply that the defect caused the functionality to regress.\nThe label tells us that something worked before and it needs extra attention from Engineering and Product Managers to schedule/reschedule.\nThe regression label does not apply to bugs for new features for which functionality was\nnever verified as working\n.\nThese, by definition, are not regressions.\nA regression should always have the\n~regression:xx.x\nlabel on it to designate when it was introduced. If it‚Äôs unclear when it was introduced, the latest released version should be added.\nRegressions should be considered high priority issues that should be solved as soon as possible, especially if they have severe impact on users. When identified in time, for example in a SaaS deployment, fixing them within the same milestone avoids their being included with that release.\nUse of the ~regression label on MRs\nFor better efficiency, it‚Äôs common for a regression to be fixed in an MR without an issue being created, either through reversion of the original MR or a code change. Regardless of whether there is an issue or not, the MR should also have the\n~regression\nand\n~regression:xx.x\nlabels. This allows for trends to be accurately measured.\nBasics\nStart working on an issue you‚Äôre assigned to. If you‚Äôre not assigned to any issue, find the issue with the highest priority and relevant label you can work on, and assign it to yourself.\nYou can use this query, which sorts by priority for the started milestones\n, and filter by the label for your team.\nIf you need to schedule something or prioritize it, apply the appropriate labels (see\nScheduling issues\n).\nIf you are working on an issue that touches on areas outside of your expertise, be sure to mention someone in the other group(s) as soon as you start working on it. This allows others to give you early feedback, which should save you time in the long run.\nIf you are working on an issue that requires access to specific features, systems, or groups, open an\naccess request\nto obtain access on staging and production for testing your changes after they are merged.\nWhen you start working on an issue:\nAdd the\nworkflow::in dev\nlabel to the issue.\nCreate a merge request (MR) by clicking on the\nCreate merge request\nbutton in the issue. This creates a MR with the labels, milestone and title of the issue. It also relates the just created MR to the issue.\nAssign the MR to yourself.\nWork on the MR until it is ready, it meets GitLab‚Äôs\ndefinition of done\n, and the pipeline succeeds.\nEdit the description and click on the\nRemove the Draft: prefix from the title\nbutton.\nAssign it to the suggested reviewer(s) from\nReviewer Roulette\n. If there are reviewers for multiple categories, for example: frontend, backend and database, assign all of them. Alternatively, assign someone who specifically needs to review. When assigning, also @mention them in the comments, requesting a review.\n(Optionally) Unassign yourself from the MR. Some may find leaving the MR assigned to themselves easier to track the MRs they are responsible for by using the built in MR button/notification icon in the GitLab navigation bar.\nChange the workflow label of the issue to\nworkflow::in review\n. If multiple people are working on the issue or multiple workflow labels might apply, consider breaking the issue up. Otherwise, default to the workflow label farthest away from completion.\nPotentially, a reviewer offers feedback and assigns back to the author.\nThe author addresses the feedback and this goes back and forth until all reviewers approve the MR.\nAfter approving, the reviewer in each category unassigns themselves and assigns the suggested maintainer in their category.\nMaintainer reviews take place with any back and forth as necessary and attempts to resolve any open threads.\nThe last maintainer to approve the MR, follows the\nMerging a merge request\nguidelines.\n(Optionally) Change the workflow label of the issue to\nworkflow::verification\n, to indicate all the development work for the issue has been done and it is waiting to be deployed and verified. We will use this label in cases where the work was requested to be verified by product OR we determined we need to perform this verification in production.\nWhen the change has been verified, change the workflow label to\nworkflow::complete\nand close the issue.\nYou are responsible for the issues assigned to you. This means it has to ship with the milestone it‚Äôs associated with. If you are not able to do this, you have to communicate it early to your manager and other stakeholders (e.g. the product manager, other engineers working on dependent issues). In teams, the team is responsible for this (see\nWorking in Teams\n). If you are uncertain, err on the side of overcommunication. It‚Äôs always better to communicate doubts than to wait.\nYou (and your team, if applicable) are responsible for:\nEnsuring that your changes\napply cleanly to GitLab Enterprise Edition\n.\nThe testing of a new feature or fix, especially right after it has been merged and packaged.\nCreating any\nrelevant feature or API documentation\nShipping secure code, (see\nSecurity is everyone‚Äôs responsibility\n).\nOnce a release candidate has been deployed to the staging environment, please verify that your changes work as intended. We have seen issues where bugs did not appear in development but showed in production (e.g. due to CE-EE merge issues).\nBe sure to read general guidelines about\nissues\nand\nmerge requests\n.\nUpdating Workflow Labels Throughout Development\nTeam members use labels to track issues throughout development. This gives visibility to other developers, product managers, and designers, so that they can adjust their plans during a monthly iteration. An issue should follow these stages:\nworkflow::in dev\n: A developer indicates they are developing an issue by applying the\nin dev\nlabel.\nworkflow::in review\n: A developer indicates the issue is in code review and UX review by replacing the\nin dev\nlabel with the\nin review\nlabel.\nworkflow::verification\n: A developer indicates that all the development work for the issue has been done and is waiting to be deployed, then verified.\nworkflow::complete\n: A developer indicates the issue has been verified and everything is working by adding the\nworkflow::complete\nlabel and closing the issue.\nWorkflow labels are described in our\nDevelopment Documentation\nand\nProduct Development Flow\n.\nWorking in Teams\nFor larger issues or issues that contain many different moving parts, you‚Äôll be likely working in a team. This team will typically consist of a\nbackend engineer\n, a\nfrontend engineer\n, a\nProduct Designer\nand a\nproduct manager\n.\nTeams have a shared responsibility to ship the issue in the planned release.\nIf the team suspects that they might not be able to ship something in time, the team should escalate / inform others as soon as possible. A good start is informing your manager.\nIt‚Äôs generally preferable to ship a smaller iteration of an issue, than ship something a release later.\nConsider starting a Slack channel for a new team, but remember to write all relevant information in the related issue(s). You don‚Äôt want to have to read up on two threads, rather than only one, and Slack channels are not open to the greater GitLab community.\nIf an issue entails frontend and backend work, consider separating the frontend and backend code into separate MRs and merge them independently under\nfeature flags\n. This will ensure frontend/backend engineers can work and deliver independently.\nIt‚Äôs important to note that even though the code is merged behind a feature flag, it should still be production ready and continue to hold our\ndefinition of done\n.\nA separate MR containing the integration, documentation (if applicable) and removal of the feature flags should be completed in parallel with the backend and frontend MRs, but should only be merged when both the frontend and backend MRs are on the master branch.\nIn the spirit of\ncollaboration\nand\nefficiency\n, members of teams should feel free to discuss issues directly with one another while\nbeing respectful of others‚Äô time\n.\nConvention over Configuration\nAvoid adding configuration values in the application settings or in\ngitlab.yml\n. Only add configuration if it is absolutely necessary. If you\nfind yourself adding parameters to tune specific features, stop and consider\nhow this can be avoided. Are the values really necessary? Could constants be\nused that work across the board? Could values be determined automatically?\nSee\nConvention over Configuration\nfor more discussion.\nChoosing Something to Work On\nStart working on things with the highest priority in the current milestone. The priority of items are defined under labels in the repository, but you are able to sort by priority.\nAfter sorting by priority, choose something that you‚Äôre able to tackle and falls under your responsibility. That means that if you‚Äôre a frontend developer, you work on something with the label\nfrontend\n.\nTo filter very precisely, you could filter all issues for:\nMilestone: Started\nAssignee: None (issue is unassigned)\nLabel: Your label of choice. For instance\n,\nDiscussion\n,\nQuality\n,\nfrontend\n, or\nPlatform\nSort by priority\nUse this link to quickly set the above parameters\n. You‚Äôll still need to filter by the label for your own team.\nIf you‚Äôre in doubt about what to work on, ask your lead. They will be able to tell you.\nTriaging and Reviewing Code from the rest of the Community\nIt‚Äôs every\ndevelopers‚Äô responsibilities\nto triage and review code contributed by the rest of the community, and work with them to get it ready for production.\nMerge requests from the rest of the community should be labeled with the\nCommunity contribution\nlabel.\nWhen evaluating a merge request from the community, please ensure that a relevant PM is aware of the pending MR by mentioning them.\nThis should be to be part of your daily routine. For instance, every morning you could triage new merge requests from the rest of the community that are not yet labeled\nCommunity contribution\nand either review them or ask a relevant person to review it.\nMake sure to follow our\nCode Review Guidelines\n.\nWorking with GitLab.com\nGitLab.com is a very large instance of GitLab Enterprise Edition. It runs release candidates for new releases, and sees a lot of issues because of the amount of traffic it gets. There are several internal tools available for developers at GitLab to get data about what‚Äôs happening in the production system:\nPerformance Data\nThere is extensive\nmonitoring\npublicly available for GitLab.com. For more on this and related tools, see the\nmonitoring handbook\n.\nError Reporting\nSentry\nis our error reporting tool\nlog.gprd.gitlab.net\nhas production logs\nprometheus.gitlab.com\nhas alerts for the\nproduction team\nScheduling Issues\nGitLab Inc has to be selective in working on particular issues. We have a limited capacity to work on new things. Therefore, we have to schedule issues carefully.\nProduct Managers are responsible for scheduling all issues in their respective\nproduct areas\n, including features, bugs, and tech debt. Product managers alone determine the\nprioritization\n, but others are encouraged to influence the PMs decisions. The UX Lead and Engineering Leads are responsible for allocating people making sure things are done on time. Product Managers are\nnot\nresponsible for these activities, they are not project managers.\nDirection issues are the big, prioritized new features for each release. They are limited to a small number per release so that we have plenty of capacity to work on other important issues, bug fixes, etc.\nIf you want to schedule an issue with the\nSeeking community contributions\nlabel, please remove the label first.\nAny scheduled issue should have a team label assigned, and at least one type label.\nRequesting Something to be Scheduled\nTo request scheduling an issue, ask the\nresponsible product manager\nWe have many more requests for great features than we have capacity to work on.\nThere is a good chance we‚Äôll not be able to work on something.\nMake sure the appropriate labels (such as\ncustomer\n) are applied so every issue is given the priority it deserves.\nProduct Development Timeline\nTeams (Product, UX, Development, Quality) continually work on issues according to their respective workflows.\nThere is no specified process whereby a particular person should be working on a set of issues in a given time period.\nHowever, there are specific deadlines that should inform team workflows and prioritization.\nWith the monthly\nrelease date\nbeing the third Thursday of the release month, the\ncode cut-off\nis the Friday prior.\nThe\nnext milestone begins\nthe Saturday after code cut-off.\nAll other important dates for a milestone are relative to the release date:\nMonday, 19 days before the milestone begins\n:\nDraft of the issues that will be included in the next release (released next month).\nStart capacity and technical discussions with engineering/UX.\nAssess error budgets to determine feature/reliability balance.\nDevelopment engineering manager provides product manager with prioritization input for\n~type::maintenance\nissues per\ncross-functional prioritization\nQuality\nprovides product manager with prioritization input for\n~type::bug\nissues per\ncross-functional prioritization\nMonday, 12 days before the milestone begins\n:\nProduct manager, taking into consideration prioritization input from development EM, Quality, and UX to create a plan of issues for the upcoming milestone.\nRelease scope is finalized. In-scope issues marked with milestone\n%x.y\n; label\n~deliverable\napplied.\nKickoff document is updated with relevant items to be included.\nMonday, 5 days before the milestone begins\n:\nRelease scope is finalized.

After the stages/section level reviews are complete, the VP of Development coordinates a summary review with the CTO, VP of Product, VP of UX, and VP of Quality.\nWednesday, 11 days after the milestone begins\n:\nGitLab Bot opens\nGroup Retrospective\nissue for the current milestone.\nFriday, the day the milestone ends\n:\nIssues for milestone completed, with docs, and have been merged into master.\nFeature flags should be flipped from default off to default on after verification to be in the release. See\nfeature flags\n.\nMerging by the milestone code cut-off (Friday)\ndoes not guarantee\nthat the feature will be in the release. See\nrelease timelines\n.\nIndividual\nrelease post entries\nmerged for all relevant issues.\nBy end of the day, milestone\n%x.y\nis expired.\nOn or around Wednesday, the day before the release date\n:\nGroup Retrospective issues\nare updated with shipped and missed deliverables and team-members are tagged in the discussion.\nWednesday, the day before the release date\n:\nMilestone Cleanup\nruns on the schedule at\nMilestone cleanup schedule\n.\nThird Thursday of the release month\n:\nRelease Day!\nüöÄ\nRelease shipped to production.\nRelease post published.\nFriday immediately after release day\n:\nThe patch release process for the milestone starts. This includes regular and security patch releases.\nAll of the milestone‚Äôs unfinished issues and merge requests are automatically moved to the next milestone, with the exception of\n~security\nissues.\nOn or around the Wednesday immediately following the release day\n:\nProduct plans\nare updated to reflect previous and current releases, including category epics and direction pages.\nOn or around the second Monday following the release day\n:\nNon-critical security patches are\nreleased\n.\nRefer to\nrelease post content reviews\nfor additional deadlines.\nNote that deployments to GitLab.com are more frequent than monthly major/minor releases.\nSee\nauto deploy transition\nguidance for details.\nKickoff\nAt the beginning of each release, we have a kickoff meeting, publicly livestreamed to YouTube. In the call, the Product Development team (PMs, Product Designers, and Engineers) communicate with the rest of the organization which issues are in scope for the upcoming release. The call is structured by\nproduct area\nwith each PM leading their part of the call.\nThe\nProduct Kickoff page\nis updated each month, which follows the content on the livestream.\nMilestone Cleanup\nEngineering Managers are responsible for capacity planning and scheduling for their respective teams with guidance from their counterpart Product Managers.\nTo ensure hygiene across Engineering, we run scheduled pipelines to move\nunfinished work (open issues and merge requests) with the expired milestone to\nthe next milestone, and label\n~\"missed:x.y\"\nfor the expired milestone.\nAdditionally, label\n~\"missed-deliverable\"\nwhenever\n~\"Deliverable\"\nis\npresented.\nThis is currently implemented as part of our\nautomated triage operations\n. Additionally, issues with the\n~Deliverable\nlabel which have a milestone beyond current +1, will have the\n~Deliverable\nlabel removed.\nWe keep the milestone open for 3 months after it‚Äôs expired, based on the\nrelease and maintenance policy\n.\nThe milestone cleanup is currently applied to the\nfollowing groups and projects\n:\nGitLab\n,\nschedule\nGitLab Runner\n,\nschedule\nGitLab Gitaly\n,\nschedule\nGitLab charts\n,\nschedule\nGitLab QA\n,\nschedule\nOmnibus GitLab\n,\nschedule\n(only moving milestone for now, not labelling)\nMilestones closure is in the remit of\nthe Delivery team\n. At any point in time a release might need to be created for an active milestone,and once that is no longer the case, the Delivery team closes the milestone.\nMilestone cleanup schedule\nThe milestone cleanup will happen on the milestone due date.\nThese actions will be applied to open issues:\nOpen issues and merge requests will be moved to the next milestone, and\nlabeled with\n~\"missed:x.y\"\n.\n~\"missed-deliverable\"\nwill also be added whenever\n~\"Deliverable\"\nis presented.\nMilestones are closed when the Delivery team no longer needs to create a backport release for a specific milestone.\nUse Group Labels and Group Milestones\nWhen working in GitLab (and in particular, the GitLab.org group), use group labels and group milestones as much as you can. It is easier to plan issues and merge requests at the group level, and exposes ideas across projects more naturally. If you have a project label, you can promote it to a group milestone. This will merge all project labels with the same name into the one group label. The same is true for promoting group milestones.\nTechnical debt\nWe definitely don‚Äôt want our technical debt to grow faster than our code base. To prevent this from happening we should consider not only the impact of the technical debt but also consider the impacts spreading like a contagion. How big and how fast is this problem going to be over time? Is it likely a bad piece of code will be copy-pasted for a future feature? In the end, the amount of resources available is always less than amount of technical debt to address.\nTo help with prioritization and decision-making process here, we recommend thinking about contagion as an interest rate of the technical debt. There is\na great comment\nfrom the internet about it:\nYou wouldn‚Äôt pay off your $50k student loan before first paying off your $5k credit card and it‚Äôs because of the high interest rate. The best debt to pay off first is one that has the highest loan payment to recurring payment reduction ratio, i.e. the one that reduces your overall debt payments the most, and that is usually the loan with the highest interest rate.\nTechnical debt is prioritized like\nother technical decisions\nin\nproduct groups\nby\nproduct management\n.\nFor technical debt which might span, or fall in gaps between groups they should be brought up for a\nglobally optimized\nprioritization in\nretrospectives\nor directly with the appropriate member of the\nProduct Leadership team\n. Additional avenues for addressing technical debt outside of product groups are\nRapid Action issues\nand\nworking groups\n.\nDeferred UX\nSometimes there is an intentional decision to deviate from the agreed-upon\n, which sacrifices the user experience. When this occurs, the Product Designer creates a follow-up issue and labels it\nDeferred UX\nto address the UX gap in subsequent releases.\nFor the same reasons as technical debt, we don‚Äôt want Deferred UX to grow faster than our code base.\nThese issues are prioritized like\nother technical decisions\nin\nproduct groups\nby\nproduct management\n.\nAs with\ntechnical debt\n, Deferred UX should be brought up for\nglobally optimized\nprioritization in\nretrospectives\nor directly with the appropriate member of the\nProduct Leadership team\n.\nUI polish\nUI polish issues are visual improvements to the existing user interface, touching mainly aesthetic aspects of the UI that are guided by\nPajamas\nfoundations. UI polish issues generally capture improvements related to color, typography, iconography, and spacing. We apply the\nUI polish\nlabel to these issues. UI polish issues don‚Äôt introduce functionality or behavior changes to a feature.\nExamples of UI polish\nAesthetic improvements\n(\nexample\n): removing unnecessary borders from a UI, updating the background color of an element, fixing the font size of a heading element.\nMisalignment of text, buttons, etc\n(\nexample\n): although because many times something isn‚Äôt broken, these improvements are considered UI polish. These could also be considered a bug.\nIncorrect spacing between UI elements\n(\nexample\n): when two interface elements are using inconsistent spacing values, such as 10px instead of 8px. It could also be considered technical debt. Note that if two interface elements have zero space between them, its an obvious bug.\nVisual inconsistencies across different product areas\n(\nexample\n): visual inconsistencies could occur when we have a series of buttons on a particular view. For example, when 3/4 of them have been migrated to use the Pajamas component, and 1/4 of them are still using a deprecated button, resulting in a visual inconsistency. This is considered a UI polish.\nWhat is not UI polish\nFunctional inconsistency related to the experience\n: for example, using a manual action to add an assignee automatically shows the assignee in the sidebar but using a manual action to add a weight to an issue does not automatically show the weight in the sidebar. This is not currently considered UI polish. It would be considered a UX issue.\nImproving visibility of system status\n: status indicator improvements are experience improvements and are not classified as UI polish.\nEven when updating something that is purely visual, such as a status icon, to improve the meaning the user has of what they are viewing, we are trying to improve the experience of that user.\nMonitor Merge Request Trends\nOpen merge requests sometimes become idle (not updated by a human in more than a month). Once a month, engineering managers will receive an\nMerge requests requiring attention triage issue\nthat includes all (non-WIP/Draft) MRs for their group and use it to determine if any action should be taken (such as nudging the author/reviewer/maintainer). This assists in getting merge requests merged in a reasonable amount of time which we track with the\nOpen MR Review Time (OMRT)\nand\nOpen MR Age (OMA)\nperformance indicators.\nOpen merge requests may also have other properties that indicate that the engineering manager should research them and potentially take action to improve efficiency. One key property is the number of threads, which, when high, may indicate a need to update the plan for the MR or that a synchronous discussion should be considered. Another property is the number of pipelines, which, when high, may indicate a need to revisit the plan for the MR. These metrics are not yet included in an automatically created a triage issue.\nSecurity is everyone‚Äôs responsibility\nSecurity\nis our top priority. Our Security Team is raising the bar on security every day to protect users‚Äô data and make GitLab a safe place for everyone to contribute. There are many lines of code, and Security Teams need to scale. That means shifting security left in the\nSoftware Development LifeCycle (SDLC)\n. Each team has an\nApplication Security Stable Counterpart\nwho can help you, and you can find more secure development help in the\n#sec-appsec\nSlack channel.\nBeing able to start the security review process earlier in the software development lifecycle means we will catch vulnerabilities earlier, and mitigate identified vulnerabilities before the code is merged. You should know when and how to proactively\nseek an Application Security Review\n. You should also be familiar with our\nSecure Coding Guidelines\n.\nWe are fixing the obvious security issues before every merge, and therefore, scaling the security review process. Our workflow includes a check and validation by the reviewers of every merge request, thereby enabling developers to act on identified vulnerabilities before merging. As part of that process, developers are also encouraged to reach out to the Security Team to discuss the issue at that stage, rather than later on, when mitigating vulnerabilities becomes more expensive. After all, security is everyone‚Äôs job. See also our\nSecurity Paradigm\n.\nRapid Engineering Response\nFrom time to time, there are occasions that engineering team must act quickly in response to urgent issues. This section describes how the engineering team handles certain kinds of such issues.\nScope\nNot everything is urgent. See below for a non-exclusive list of things that are in-scope and not in-scope. As always, use your experience and judgment, and communicate with others.\nIn Scope\nLast-minute release blocking bug or security patch before an imminent release.\nHigh severity (severity::1/priority::1) security issues. Refer to\nsecurity severity and priority\n.\nHighest priority and severity customer issues based on the\npriority and severity definitions\n.\nNot In Scope\nAn operational issue of GitLab.com or a self managed customer environment. This falls under the\non-call\nprocess.\nSelf developed and maintained tools that are not officially supported products by GitLab.\nFeature request by a specific customer.\nProcess\nPerson requesting Rapid Engineering Response creates an issue supplying all known information and applies\npriority and severity\n(or\nsecurity severity and priority\n) to the best of their ability.\nPerson requesting Rapid Engineering Response raises the issue to their own manager and the\nsubject matter domain\nengineering manager (or the delegation if OOO).\nIn case a specific group cannot be determined, raise the issue to the Director of Engineering (or the delegation if OOO) of the\nsection\n.\nIn case a specific section cannot be determined, raise the issue to the Sr. Director of Development (or the delegation if OOO).\nThe engineering sponsor (subject matter Manager, Director, and/or Sr. Director) invokes all stakeholders of the subject matter as a rapid response task force to determine the best route of resolution:\nEngineering manager(s)\nProduct Management\nDocs\nSecurity\nSupport\nDistribution engineering manager\nDelivery engineering manager (Release Management)\nAdjust\npriority and severity\nor\nsecurity severity and priority\nif necessary, and work collaboratively on the determined resolution.\nPerformance Refinement\nA bi-weekly performance refinement session is held by the Development and QE teams jointly to raise awareness and foster wider collaboration about high-impact performance issues.\nA high impact issue has a direct measurable impact on GitLab.com\nservice levels or error budgets\n.\nScope\nThe\nPerformance Refinement issue board\nis reviewed in this refinement exercise.\nProcess\nTo participate in the bi-weekly refinement, ask your engineering director to forward the invite of the\nPerformance Refinement\nmeeting which is at 15:00 UTC every other Thursday. Here is the\nmeeting agenda\n.\nTo nominate issues to the board:\nAssign\na performance severity\non the issue to help asses the priority assignment for the refinement session.\nEnsure that the issue clearly explains the problem, the (potential) impact on GitLab.com‚Äôs availability, and ideally, clearly defines a proposed solution to the problem.\nUse the label\nbug::performance\n.\nFor the issues under the\nOpen\ncolumn:\nAn engineering manager will be assigned if either the\nMilestone\nor the label\nworkflow::ready for development\nis missing.\nEngineering manager brings assigned issue(s) to the Product Manager for prioritization and planning.\nEngineering manager unassigns themselves once the issue is planned for an iteration, i.e. associated with a\nMilestone\nand the label\nworkflow::ready for development\n.\nTo highlight high-impact issues which need additional discussion, please add an agenda item.\nIf a guest attendee would be helpful for collaboration, please forward the invite. For example, a CSM or Support Engineer may have information that would be helpful for an upcoming topic.\nInfradev\nThe infradev process is established to identify issues requiring priority attention in support of SaaS availability and reliability. These escalations are intended to primarily be asyncronous as timely triage and attention is required. In addition to primary management through the Issues, any gaps, concerns, or critical triage is handled in the\nSaaS Availability weekly standup\n.\nScope\nThe\ninfradev issue board\nis the primary focus of this process.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nInfrastructure\nNominate issues by adding\nInfradev\nlabel.\nAssess\nSeverity\nand\nPriority\nand apply the corresponding label as appropriate.\nProvide\nas much information as possible\nto assist development engineering troubleshooting.\nDevelopment\nDevelopment directors are responsible for\ntriaging Infradev issues\nregularly by following the\ntriage process\nbelow.\nDevelopment managers are encouraged to\ntriage issues\nregularly as well.\nDevelopment managers collaborate with their counterpart Product Managers to refine, schedule, and resolve Infradev issues.\nUsually, issues are nominated as Infradev issues by SREs or Managers in the Infrastructure Department. Development engineers/managers are not expected to nominate Infradev issues.\nHowever, when it‚Äôs necessary to spin off new issues from an existing Infradev issue, development engineers and managers may also apply\nInfradev\nlabel to the new issues.\nWhen development engineers and managers split off new Infradev issues, they must have a\nSeverity\nand\nPriority\nlabels to the new issues.  The labels should correspond to the importance of the follow-on work.\nProduct Management\nProduct Managers perform holistic prioritization of both product roadmap and Infradev issues as one unified backlog.\nProduct Managers collaborate with their counterpart Development Managers to refine, schedule, and resolve Infradev issues.\nTriage Process\n(To be completed primarily by Development Engineering Management)\nIssues are nominated to the board through the inclusion of the label\ninfradev\nand will appear on the\ninfradev board\n.\nReview issues in the Open column. Look for issues within your Stage/Group/Category, but also for those which lack a clear assignment or where the assignment may need correction.\nReview the\nseverity\non the issue to validate appropriate prioritization.\nEnsure that the issue clearly explains the problem, the (potential) impact on GitLab.com‚Äôs availability, and ideally, clearly defines a proposed solution to the problem.\nAssign a Development Manager and a Product Manager to any issue where the\nMilestone\nor the label\nworkflow::ready for development\nis missing.\nDevelopment Manager and Product Manager collaborate on the assigned issue(s) for prioritization and planning.\nDevelopment Manager and Product Manager unassign themselves once the issue is planned for an iteration, i.e. associated with a\nMilestone\nand the label\nworkflow::ready for development\n.\nAll Issues should be prioritized into the appropriate workflow stage. It is the intent to maintain no Open (un-triaged) items.\nIssues with\n~infradev ~severity::1 ~priority::1 ~production request\nlabels applied require immediate resolution.\n~infradev\nissues requiring a ~‚Äúbreaking change‚Äù should not exist.  If a current\n~infradev\nissue requires a breaking change then it should split into two issues.  The first issue should be the immediate\n~infradev\nwork that can be done under current SLOs.  The second issue should be  ~‚Äúbreaking change‚Äù work that needs to be completed at the next major release in accordance with\ndeprecation guidance\n. Agreement from development DRI as well as the infrastructure DRI should be documented on the issue.\nInfradev issues are also shown in the monthly\nError Budget Report\n.\nA Guide to Creating Effective Infradev Issues\nTriage of infradev Issues is desired to occur asynchronously. These points below with endure that your infradev issues gain maximum traction.\nUse the\nInfraDev issue template\nto create the issue on the gitlab-org/gitlab issue tracker.\nClearly state the scope of the problem, and how it affects GitLab SaaS Platforms\n. Examples could include:\nReliability issues: the problem could cause a widespread outage or degradation on GitLab.com.\nexample\nSaturation issues: the problem could leave to increased saturation, latency issues due to resource over-utilization.\nexample\nService-level degradation: the problem is causing our service-level monitoring to degrade, impacting the overall SLA of GitLab.com and potentially leaving to SLA violations.\nexample\nUnnecessary alerts: the problem does not have a major impact on users, but is leading to extraneous alerts, impacting the ability of SREs to effectively triage incidents due to alerting noise.\nexample\nProblems which extend the time to diagnosis of incidents: for example, issues which degrade the observability of GitLab.com, swallow user-impacting errors or logs, etc. These could lead to incidents taking much longer to clear, and impacting availability.\nexample\nDeficiencies in our public APIs which lead to customers compensating by generating substantially more traffic to get the required results.\nexample\nQuantify the effect of the problem\nto help ensure that correct prioritization occurs.\nInclude costs to availability. The\nIncident Budget Explorer\ndashboard can help here.\nInclude the number of times alerts have fired owing to the problem, how much time was spent dealing with the problem, and how many people were involved.\nInclude screenshots of visualization from Grafana or Kibana.\nAlways include a permalink to the source of the screenshot so that others can investigate further\n.\nProvide a clear, unambiguous, self-contained solution to the problem\n. Do not add the\ninfradev\nlabel to architectural problems, vague solutions, or requests to investigate an unknown root-cause.\nEnsure scope is limited\n. Each issue should be able to be owned by a single stage group team and should not need to be broken down further. Single task solutions are best.\nEnsure a realistic severity is applied\n: review the\navailability severity label guidelines\nand ensure that applied severity matches. Always ensure all issues have a severity, even if you are unsure.\nIf possible, include ownership labels\nfor more effective triage. The\nproduct categories\ncan help determine the appropriate stage group to assign the issue to.\nCross-reference links to Production Incidents, PagerDuty Alerts, Slack Alerts and Slack Discussions\n. To help ensure that the team performing the triage have all the available data.\nBy adding ‚ÄúRelated‚Äù links on the infradev issue, the\nInfradev Status Report\nwill display a count of the number of production incidents related to each infradev issue, for easier and clearer prioritization.\nEnsure that the issue title is accurate, brief and clear\n. Change the title over time if you need to keep it accurate.\nBy adding an infradev label to an issue, you are assuming responsibility and becoming the sponsor/champion of the issue\n.\nProvide a method for validating that the original issue still exists\nSometimes infradev issues will resolve on their own, or are resolved as a side-effect of an unrelated change.\nIn the infradev issue description, provide a clear way of checking whether the problem still exists.\nHaving a way of checking validity can save on a great deal of back-and-forth discussion between Infradev Triage participants including Engineering Managers, Directors and Product Managers and make space for other non-resolved issues to get scheduled sooner.\nIdeally, provide a link to a Grafana query or an ELK query and clear instructions on how to interpret the results to determine whether the problem is still occurring.\nCheck the ‚ÄúVerfication‚Äù section in this issue as an example of this\n.\nAlternatively, provide clear instructions on how to recreate or validate the problem.\nIf an issue has been resolved, use the following process:\nReassign the issue back to the author, or an appropriate owner, requesting that they confirm the resolution, and close the issue  if they concur. If not, they should follow up with a note and unassign themselves.\nCode Review Guidelines\nCode reviews are mandatory for every merge request, you should get familiar with and follow our Code Review Guidelines.\nCode Review Values\nGitLab team members' code review values\nIteration\nIn order to provide changes in an iterative and incremental manner, we should always seek to create ‚Ä¶\nRelated Engineering Workflows\nAt GitLab we have a number of engineering processes that we use on a daily basis.\nRelease/Feature Determination Workflow\nThis document explains the workflow for determining if a feature will be included in a milestone ‚Ä¶\nLast modified July 7, 2025:\nExpand infradev process to reference all SaaS platforms rather than just GitLab.com (\n09694d48\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 9544}

This includes our regular cadence of monthly releases which happen\nevery month\n, and patch/security releases whenever necessary.\nRelease posts follow a process outlined here, and the templates that are used to create them also highlight what needs to be done, by whom, and when those items are due.\nFrequently used templates\nHelpful reference pages\nRelease post scheduling\nSchedule\nAt a high level, the Release post schedule is:\nMonday, 3 weeks before release\nRelease Post Manager manually trigger the following\nscheduled pipelines in the www-gitlab-com project\n:\nRelease Post Process Kickoff Tasks\nThese invoke the\nbin/rake release_post:start\nrake task. (\npipeline configuration\n;\nrake task\n)\nThis task creates the branches, MRs, and issues necessary to run the Release Post process\nThe MRs and issues will be assigned to the Release Post Manager using the content in\nrelease_post_managers.yml\nAfter the\nRelease Post Process Kickoff Tasks\npipeline completes, and the release post branch is created with associated merge request, manually trigger the following\nscheduled pipelines in the www-gitlab-com project\n:\nAdd deprecations and removals to current release post branch\nMonday through Thursday, 3 weeks before release\nPMs\ncontribute MRs for their\ncontent blocks\nFeatures and Upgrades\nare contributed as release post item MRs targeting the release post branch\nPrimary items are added to\nfeatures.yml\nRecurring content blocks for Omnibus, GitLab Runner, and Mattermost are added by the area owner\nNon-standard product announcements, uncategorized items, and other announcements can be announced using the\nextras\ncontent type\nEMs and PMs\nannounce\ndeprecations and removals\nThursday, 1 week before release\nCode cutoff\nEMs and PMs\nmake sure items that are feature flagged are\nenabled by default\nto ensure inclusion into the self-managed release.\nDeprecation and removal MRs are assigned to TWs for final review and merge.\nTW Reviewers\nfinish review of Features, Deprecations, Removals, Upgrades, and Extras\nPMMs, Product Design Managers, Product Designers, and PM Leaders\ndo optional reviews of release post item MRs\nEMs\n:\nMerge feature release post item MRs if the underlying code was merged by the Thursday, 1 week before release\nMerge feature release post item MRs if manually verified to be in the release\nMRs can be manually verified using the\n/chatops run release check <MR URL> <RELEASE>\nchatops command\nTW Reviewers\nmerge deprecation and removal MRs\nNote:\nMRs added after the Thursday, 1 week before release should target the\nrelease-x-y\nbranch, not\nmaster\nMonday of release week\nAt\n4 pm UTC (11 am ET / 8 am PT)\n, another\nrelease post automation\ntask (\nscheduled pipeline\n;\nrake task\n) performs content assembly\nRelease Post Manager\npicks features to highlight and creates the introduction content\nMonday through Tuesday of release week\nContributor Success\nadds the\nNotable Contributor\nRelease Post Manager and Technical Writer\nperform final reviews\nChanges after\n4 pm UTC (11 am ET / 8 am PT)\non the Monday of release week will be done via the\nrelease-X-Y\nbranch and are subject to approval by the Release Post Manager.\nThe TW Lead verifies the deprecations and removals links in the release post\nRPM create a\nWhat‚Äôs New\nNote:\nThe Monday through Tuesday of release week can fall on vacations or holidays. PMs should designate who to respond to time-sensitive inquiries should they be unreachable. Release Post Managers are empowered to make decisions and\ndisplay bias for action\nif they haven‚Äôt received a response by EOD on the Tuesday of release week.\nThursday, release day\nRelease team\npublishes the latest package\nAfter the package is\nreleased\n, the\nRelease Post Manager\npublishes the release post to the  master branch\nThe\nGitLab.org Releases page\nwill also populate the changelog via an\nautomated process\nwhen release posts are published (\npipeline task\n)\nNote:\nDetails for all of these steps are described in the\nMonthly release\npost\nMR template\nand the\nMonthly release\npost item\nMR template\n.\nParticipants\nRelease Post Manager\nPM contributors\nPMM reviewers\nPMM lead\nTW lead\nProduct Design reviewers\nTW reviewers\nTechnical advisors\nEngineering Managers\nVolunteering for the Release post\nEach month, a Product Manager, Technical Writer, and an Engineering Department Technical Advisor volunteer to manage the release post, as listed in the\nRelease Post Scheduling page\n. Product Marketing Managers also sign up, but mostly as shadows for awareness for their related marketing activities. The Product Manager volunteer will lead the release post as the Release Post Manager and is listed as the Author of the release post when the post is published. To update the\nrelease post scheduling list\n, all volunteers need to edit the data file below:\nData YAML file\n: gathers the Release Post Managers for every release (9.0 onwards). Be sure to update the ‚ÄúManagers‚Äù section below the ‚ÄúVersions‚Äù if this is your first release.\nIt‚Äôs highly recommended that all volunteers shadow the release post prior to the one they run. Volunteers can update the previously mentioned data YAML file to indicate both when they shadow and when they help run the release post.\nRelease Post Managers will need\nMaintainer\naccess privileges for the\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/\nproject. If you need access, model your request after\nthis confidential issue\n.\nRelease Post Manager\nProduct Managers of any level (IC or managers) can volunteer for any release that doesn‚Äôt have someone assigned yet. While we encourage IC product managers to take advantage of this opportunity to demonstrate their leadership skills, we also value that managers will bring their experience to the role.\nBefore committing to the date of your choice, please be sure you can perform the critical path Release Post Manager tasks between Thursday, 1 week before release, and the\nrelease date\nof the month as defined in the\nmonthly MR template\n. If you cannot perform any of the Release Post Manager tasks between Thursday, 1 week before release, and the\nrelease date\nof the month, please sign up for a release post that better aligns with your availability.\nTo assign yourself as Release Post Manager or Release Post Manager‚Äôs shadow, simply add your name on the\nRelease Post Scheduling page\nby submitting an MR to update the\n/data/release_post_managers.yml\nfile. Otherwise, PMs will be assigned using a fair scheduling principle leveraging this\ntracking doc\n:\nMembers that never managed a release post before\nMembers that have the longest interval since they managed their last release post\nAfter joining the company, there is a grace period of a few months where the new Product Manager\nwill get up to speed with the process, then they will be scheduled to manage a release post.\nAdding members to the list is a shared task, and everyone can contribute by following the\nprinciple described above. Scheduled people are pinged in the merge request to make them aware.\nThey don‚Äôt need to confirm or approve, since they can always update the list if they are not\navailable for the given release post.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Important\nIf you‚Äôre scheduled for a given month and you can‚Äôt make it because you‚Äôre on\nvacation, overloaded, or for any other reason, that is okay,\nas long as you swap the\nRelease Post Manager role\nwith someone else\nbefore\ncreating the merge request and starting the\nwhole process. If you take it, you‚Äôre responsible for the entire process and must be\navailable to carry it out until the end.\nRelease Post Manager Shadow\nEach month, a Product Manager also acts as a shadow to support the Release Post Manager tasks if needed, act as back up on decisions in absence of the Release Post Manager and prepare to run the next release post. By shadowing the month prior to leading the effort, Product Managers are prepared and aware of any shifts in processes or optimizations needed since the last time they participated.\nShadows should remain engaged with the release process by:\nFollowing the activity in the slack channels\nAttending the weekly standups\nAssisting the Release Post Manager with content reviews and any other tasks they ask for help on\nIn order to properly onboard the shadow, the Release Post Manager should:\nSet up an initial coffee chat with your shadow the week after the previous release ships to get to know each other and clarify any initial questions from the shadow\nPoint the shadow to this page\nInclude the shadow in the initial release post MR creation\nInclude the shadow on all meetings and as much as possible on activities like reviews or other opportunities where you can work synchronously together\nRemember: The goal of the shadow is to get them engaged and aware of the process so they can run one on their own. Include the shadow as much as possible so they can learn and be prepared!\nTechnical Advisor considerations\nWe recommend that technical advisors volunteer for at least 2 or 3 release posts in a row to allow proper time for orientation with the process and the ongoing technical backlog.\nTechnical advisors are expected to:\nSolve problems with Git branch conflicts and Ruby installations.\nBe able to technically contribute to\nwww-gitlab-com\nsource code.\nResolve some of the\nbacklog issues\n.\nThe responsibilities of a technical advisor can be seen in more detail in\nTechnical advisors\n.\nRelease Post Manager Responsibilities\nCritical path tasks\nCompleting all the tasks assigned to the Release Post Manager in the Release Post MR template\nReminder: If you cannot perform any of the Release Post Manager tasks between Thursday, 1 week before release, and the\nrelease date\nof the month as defined in the\nmonthly MR template\n, it is recommended you sign up for another release post.

As such, if the Release Post Manager is seeking guidance on how to phrase certain posts, it‚Äôs recommended to scroll to the approximate date that post would have been made by the previous Release Post Manager in the relevant Slack channel. However, here are some best practices and an example:\nMake a clear, descriptive statement of what‚Äôs being shared and why\nIf you need someone to take an action, say so explicitly and tag that person\nIf the action requested is time sensitive, give a clear due date\nIf there are known issues they need to be aware of, list them out\nAlways cc your release post team for big announcements so everyone is in the loop\nWhen communicating in either Slack\n#release-post\nor\n#X-Y-release-post-prep\n, organize your announcements and requests via unique discussions threads to make it easier to track conversations. For example, avoid combining various reminders just because they fall on the same date when they address different topics. As a general rule, if there‚Äôs is a unique task list item for the reminder in the MR template, that reminder should get its own separate post whether it is in Slack or the MR itself. Also, review GitLab‚Äôs\neffective slack communication\nguidance.\nSample post to executive stakeholders for review is below.\nThe name of the PLT member who is reviewing this month can be found on the\nrelease post scheduling page\n@[name of PLT member who is reviewing this month] The 13.6 Release Post has been generated and can be reviewed at\n`https://release-13-6.about.gitlab-review.app/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/index.html`\nPlease share your feedback by\n<\ntime\ndatetime\n=\n\"18:00\"\n>\n6 pm UTC (1 pm ET / 10 am PT)\n</\ntime\n>\non Friday November 20 (tomorrow). Thank you for your review!\nCurrently there are no known issues/adjustments to the content but I know of one deprecation that needs to be added and will happen with my first wave of edits.\nHere's the 13.6 release post MR:\n`https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/66652`\ncc\nLead\n@tech\n-advisor\nOther samples for posts include reminders and notices on any items that the Release Post Manager is taking:\nüé∫ Hi team! Announcing a \"last call\" that no further contributions to the bugs, performance improvements, and usability improvements MRs will be taken after the Thursday, 1 week before release. Please get them in üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è cc @[name of PLT member who is reviewing this month]\nHey team, reminder that there are currently XX Open and Ready MRs targeting XX.X milestone (link to open MRs). Please take a moment to ask your EMs to merge or to move out the items that won't make milestone.\nHi all, I will be completing the final merge for the release post in the next 45 minutes-1 hour! I will be coordinating any activities with team members to resolve any problems that come up. cc\n@Tech\nAdvisor\nLead\nThe Developer Advocacy Team will reach out to the Release Post Manager in Slack #release-post following their\nRelease days process\nwhen they need help responding to inquiries about content in the release post blog. These needs will primarily arise within the first week of going live with the blog. However, as the Author for a specific release post, you may get pinged to help coordinate a response some weeks later as issues arise. You will usually just need to find the best DRI to handle the issue, often the PM of the release post item in question.\nSometimes, external PR and Marketing firms reporting on the release or managing media relations may ping the RPM directly with questions, since the RPM is the ‚Äúauthor‚Äù of the release post. If this happens, the Release Post Manager should figure out who in Marketing can take over this communication.\nContent reviews\nThe due dates for various reviews across all participants can be found on the\nrelease post MR template\nand the\nrelease post item MR template\n. PM contributors are encouraged to cease attempts to add new content blocks after the content merge deadline on the Thursday, 1 week before release, and especially after final content assembly happens on the Monday of release week at\n3 pm UTC (11 am ET / 8 am PT)\n. Exceptions can be made for highly impactful features, but it is up to the discretion of the Release Post Manager to work with the PM to add more content blocks up until the Wednesday, day before release.\nKeeping an eye on the various content reviews (TW, PMM, and Director) for the individual release post items (content block MRs) is the responsibility of PM contributor. However, it is recommended that the Release Post Manager keep an eye on how many items are not yet marked with the Ready label on the Thursday, 3 weeks before release of the month or not yet merged on the Thursday, 1 week before release, and check in with PMs in Slack Release Post channel to support and clear hurdles if needed. A really easy way to do this is to keep your eyes on the\nPreview page\nand copy-edit and link check items as new items appear. It‚Äôs also important to do this because this page is LIVE to users and should be error free.\nThe review and any needed adjustment to the ordering of secondary features due to stakeholder feedback is the responsibility of the Release Post Manager. Secondary features, removals, and upgrade notes are all sorted alphabetically by title, grouped by stage. To affect the sort order of the secondary features, a change to the content block‚Äôs\ntitle\nis required. The Release Post Manager should work with the product managers of the content blocks to make these changes, to ensure accuracy and alignment.\nAfter the Review App for the release post has been generated, the Release Post Manager solicits additional feedback from the\nproduct leaders\nvia Slack in the #release-post channel.\nIt is the Release Post Manager‚Äôs responsibility to make sure all content is completed by the Tuesday of release week, ensuring a one day buffer is left for final error fixes and small improvements.\nTo the extent possible, we strive to use\nGitLab‚Äôs Community Code Review Guidelines\nwhen performing Release Post content review.\nWhat RPM should look for when reviewing content blocks\nIt is recommended for the Release Post Manager to review all content for quality, including the marketing intro. But when reviewing content blocks in each release post item MRs, the RPM should look for the following:\nAre the why (problem) and the what (solution) clearly stated? See\nwriting about features\nas a guideline for what feature descriptions should contain.\nDo the filenames follow the recommended file-naming convention? See\nimportant note on naming files\nunder\nInstructions\nfor PM contributors.\nTips for reviews\nUtilize the\nAvailable now on GitLab\npage to easily scan release post items that have been merged.\nSearch the\nAvailable now on GitLab\nand preview pages for characters like\n[\n,\n]\n,\n(\n, and\n)\nto find malformed links.\nCopy/paste the content of those pages into a tool like Grammarly to find less obvious typos like duplicate words.\nRelease post intro content\nThe introduction content of the release post (found in\nYYYY-MM-DD-gitlab-X-Y-released.html.md\n)  is templated to be standard across all release posts, and should not be modified without approval from\n@justinfarris\n. This file is linked at the top of the release post MR for reference and ease of editing. The Release Post Manager will make sure all primary items are approved and a top feature is designated and ask the VP of Product for feedback.\nPM Contributors\nProduct Managers are responsible for\nraising MRs for their content blocks\nand ensuring they are reviewed by necessary contributors by the due date. These are mostly added by the Product Managers, each filling up the sections they are\naccountable for\n, but anyone can contribute, including community contributors. Content blocks should also be added for any epics or notable community contributions that were delivered.\nContribution instructions\nIn parallel with feature development, a merge request should be prepared by the PM with the required content.\nDo not wait\nfor the feature to be merged before drafting the release post item, it is recommended PMs write Release Post Item MRs as they prepare for the milestone Kickoff.\nImportant\nThe\nInstructions\nbelow apply up to the Monday of release week\n7:59 am UTC (2:59 am ET / Thursday, 1 week before release 11:59 pm PT)\n. After content assembly on the Monday of release week, anyone who wants to include a change in the upcoming release post must coordinate with the Release Post Manager and follow detailed instructions in the\nMerging content blocks after the Monday of release week\nsection for special handling of late additions.\nKey dates\nDuring kickoff preparation, or when planning for the upcoming milestone: consider creating the release posts early to enable the team to\nwork backwards\nThursday, three weeks before the release - Drafted\n: ready for review by Product Marketing, Tech Writer, and PM Group Manager or PM Director\nMonday through Thursday the week before the release - Reviewed\n: reviewed by all required stakeholders, content revised as needed and ready to be merged\nThursday, 1 week before release - Merged\n: release post item MR merged by the Engineering Manager if feature has been merged\nMonday of release week - Final content assembly\n: and release post blog content lock in preparation for final reviews/editing\nImportant\nIf a feature being announced involves references to external business partners, you‚Äôll need to start MR draft approvals earlier. One such example would be\nCloud Seed\n. These types of announcements require extra reviews with GitLab leadership, business partners and Legal team. In these cases, please reach out to\n@justinfarris\nto start MR reviews at least one milestone ahead of the milestone in which you want to make the release post announcement.\nRelease Post Item Instructions\nOption 1: automated MR creation\nThe\nrelease post item generator\nautomates the creation of release post items using issues and epics. Draft your release post content under the\nRelease notes\nsection of the\nfeature issue template\nand then follow the\nrelease post item generator\ninstructions.\nNote:\nThe generator will not create an MR for a confidential issue. To add a release post item for work relating to a confidential issue, follow the steps below to create an MR manually and remove any confidential information or links.\nOption 2: manual MR creation\nCreate a new branch from\nmaster\nof the\nwww-gitlab-com repository\nfor each feature (primary, secondary, removal).\nDeprecations are handled differently\nOpen a merge request targeted at the\nmaster\nbranch\nUse the\nRelease Post Item template\nContent should be one YAML file added to\ndata/release_posts/unreleased/\non the\nmaster\nbranch\nSee\ndata/release_posts/unreleased/samples/\nfor format and sample content\nNote that the structure needs to be preserved, like\nfeatures:\nthen\nprimary:\n, then the feature content\nImages should be placed in\n/source/images/unreleased/\nUpdate the\ndata/features.yml\n(if applicable) to include your feature and commit the changes as part of the same merge request\nComplete the PM checklist included in the\nRelease Post Item MR template\n, which includes but not limited to these tasks:\nAssign the MR to the relevant Tech Writer for review\nAssign the MR to the relevant Product Marketing Manager, and/or Director if additional review is needed\nOnce all content is reviewed and complete, add the\nReady\nlabel and assign MR to the appropriate Engineering Manager (EM) to merge when the feature is deployed and enabled.\nImportant note on naming files\n: PMs should create file names that are descriptive and have reasonable overlap with the title of the content block itself. This makes it easier to related content blocks to yml file by different participants in the review process. Either underscores\n_\nor hyphens\n-\ncan be used as long as the correct prefix is used (\nstagename\n,\nremoval\n, or\nupgrade\n) as listed below.\nFeature file names:\nstagename-featurename.yml\n(for example,\ncreate-group-wikis.yml\n).\nDo not:\nDesignate primary vs. secondary as that can change.\nUse category or group name.\nInclude the reporter‚Äôs name.\nRemoval file names:\nremoval-something-else-descriptive.yml\nUpgrade file names:\nupgrade-another-description.yml\nSome troubleshooting hints:\nUse\ngit merge\n, don‚Äôt use\ngit rebase\n.\nRebase is a powerful tool that makes for a clean commit history, but due to the volume of commits by the number of collaborators on the\nwww-gitlab-com\nrepo, it will typically have a lot of conflicts you‚Äôll have to manually work through. Since your content MRs should only contain changes relevant to your own content block and a single addition to\nfeatures.yml\n, merge conflicts should be minimal, and typically nonexistent. If you start a rebase and run in to issues, you can always back out with\ngit rebase --abort\n.\nRemember to close your quotes, check your filenames, and indent properly.\nMany vague pipeline errors are caused by common coding gotchas. Make sure your quotes are closed, the file you‚Äôre referencing uses\nexactly\nthe same filename you listed, and you have the right indentation set on each line.\nContent\nWe want to help people understand new features to increase adoption their adoption. In general, release posts should succinctly state the problem to solve, the solution, and how customers benefit from the solution. Be sure to reference your Direction items and Release features. All items which appear\nin our\nUpcoming Releases page\nshould be included in the relevant release post.\nWhen writing your content blocks, be sure to reference\nWriting about features\nto ensure your release post item writeups align with how GitLab communicates. For example, we avoid formal phrases such as ‚Äúwe are pleased to announce‚Äù and generally speak directly to our users by saying ‚Äúyou can now do x‚Äù rather than ‚Äúthe user can now do x‚Äù. Checking out the links to these guidelines will help you align our tone/voice as you write, ensuring a smoother and more speedy review process for your release post items.\nPM contributors are encouraged to use discretion if wanting to add new content blocks after the final merge deadline of the Thursday, 1 week before release, and especially after final content assembly happens at 8 AM PST (3 PM UTC). But if highly impactful features are released that can not wait till the next blog post, PMs should reach out and coordinate with the Release Post Manager. It is up to the discretion of the Release Post Manager to work with the PM to add more content blocks up until the Wednesday, day before release.\nPrimary vs. secondary\nWhen creating your content for a Release Post item you‚Äôll need to determine if it‚Äôs a\nprimary\nor\nsecondary\nfeature. Do this in collaboration with your PMM counterpart and reference this guidance if you‚Äôre unsure:\nA feature should be\nprimary\nif the feature:\nMatures a category (post release you‚Äôd update the\ncategory maturity\nfor the category your feature lives within)\nIs\nnew\n, or a significant improvement - it adds key functionality that did not exist previously or significantly changes existing functionality\nHas high demand from customers or the wider community (measured by discussion or upvotes on an epic/issue)\nFeature ties into a current Marketing narrative or campaign\nAll\nprimary\nfeatures should have a corresponding entry in\nfeatures.yml\nas well as a photo or video in the release post item block.\nBeta features may be included as primary, or secondary items, but must clearly reflect the\nBeta\nstatus.\nExperimental features are not to be included as primary or secondary items to the release posts.\nExperimental Features\nTo include an experimental feature in the release post, use the\nexperiment template\n, when creating a release post item in the\nunreleased\ndirectory. Experiment features are displayed in their own section of the release post.\nReviews\nPM Director/Group Manager, PMM, and Product Design reviews are highly recommended, but the Tech Writer review is the only one required for inclusion in the Release Post. Tech Writer review is required even when late additions are made to the release post after the Monday of release week. The Tech Writing review should be focused on looking for typos, grammar errors, and helping with style. PMs are responsible for coordinating any significant content/tech changes. Communicating priority about which release post items are most important for review will help Product Section leads, PMMs, and Tech Writers review the right items by the Thursday, 3 weeks before release, to ensure the proper labels are applied to the MR and assign reviewers to the MR when it is ready for them to review (ex:\nTech Writing\n,\nDirection\n,\nDeliverable\n, etc).\nNote: For consistency, use the\nReviewers for Merge Requests\n] feature in GitLab when assigning PM Director/Group Manager, PMM, TW, and Product Design team members for content reviews.\nRecommendations for optional PM Director/Group Manager and PMM Reviews\nAs PMM reviews are not required, but recommended - and Product Leader and Product Design reviews are optional - PMs should consider a few things when determining which content blocks to request a review for:\nDoes the feature contribute to a Group or Stage‚Äôs overall Direction?\nDoes the feature contribute to increasing a Category‚Äôs maturity?\nDoes the feature increase our ability to compete in the market?\nDoes the feature have considerable customer demand?\nDoes the feature represent a significant UX improvement?\nIf the answer to any of these is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, it is recommended that you coordinate with your Director, PMM, and Product Design counterpart to review the content block by the Thursday, 1 week before release. As the PM it is your responsibility to communicate what MRs need a review from the TWs, PMMs, Product Designers, and Directors as well as the MRs relative priority if you have multiple content block MRs that need reviews.\nMerging Content Block MRs\nEngineering Managers are the DRIs for merging these MRs when the feature is merged into the codebase itself. This allows all of the relevant parties (Product Managers, PMMs, Product Designers, Section Leads, Technical Writers) to have enough time to review the content without having to scramble or hold up engineering from releasing a feature.\nTo enable Engineering Managers to merge their feature blocks as soon as an issue has closed, please ensure all scheduled items you want to include in the release post have content blocks MRs created for them and have the\nReady\nlabel applied when content contribution and reviews are completed.\nReviewing, editing and updating merged content blocks\nAfter content block MRs are merged, they can be viewed on the\nPreview page\nand should be updated/edited via MRs to master up until the\nfinal merge deadline of the Thursday, 1 week before release\n. Starting on the Monday of release week, content block MRs should be viewed in the Review app of the release post branch after\nfinal content assembly\n, and updated/edited on the release post branch by coordinating with the Release Post Manager. From the\nrelease date\nforward you should view the content blocks\non the blog\n. It‚Äôs important to check this page after the content block MR is merged because this page is LIVE to users and should be error free.\nAdding, editing, or removing merged content blocks during release week\nAfter the content assembly starts on the Monday of\nrelease week\nand before the end of Tuesday of release week, adding any new or removing any merged release post items\nmust be coordinated with the Release Post Manager\n.\nThis is necessary to allow them to assess the impact on the release post and coordinate any necessary adjustments with the release post team (Tech Writer, PM, etc.). Failure to do so might result in your changes not being picked into the release post.\nBefore pinging the Release Post Manager, ask yourself if your content absolutely needs to be part of the current release post. At end-of-day on the Tuesday of release week, no late content blocks will be accepted.\nRequesting a late addition during release week\nPing the Release Post Manager (RPM) in\n#release-post\nto request adding a new late addition for the\nrelease post\n, and wait for the RPM to give confirmation to proceed. New late additions are release post items that were created after content assembly has already run. The Release Post Manager will do their best to accommodate the request, but it is not guaranteed.\nIf the RPM approves the late addition, then PM and RPM will proceed by:\nPM edits the release post item MR and updates the target branch to be on the release post\nrelease-X-Y\nbranch.\nrebases\nthe release post item MR on top of\nrelease-X-Y\nbranch.\nPM moves the RPI yml file and images from\n/data/release_posts/unreleased\nto\n/data/release_posts/x_y/\n.\nPM moves any images from\n/source/images/unreleased\nto\n/source/images/x_y/\nPM Ensure that the\nimage_url\nfield in the release post yml file points to the image file under\n/source/images/x_y/\n.\nPM requests a review of the release post item MR from the Release Post Manager and release post tech advisor. Quick action:\n/assign_reviewer RP-manager\nPM notifies release post team in the\n#X-Y-release-post\nSlack channel that the late addition has been requested with a link to the MR.\nThe MR can be approved and merged by the Release Post Manager.\nIf the feature is primary and you had not previously added it to\nfeatures.yml\n, you will need to create a second MR, branched from\nmaster\nto add the feature to\nfeatures.yml\n. (\nfeatures.yml\nshould be merged to\nmaster\n, not the release post branch).\nProcess for removing merged content blocks\nPing the Release Post Manager in Slack\n#release-post\nto notify them you need to remove an item already merged onto\nthe release X-Y\nbranch.\nEither the Release Post Manager or the PM, with approval from the Release Post Manager, will remove YAML and image files from the\nrelease X-Y\nbranch.\nThe PM will remove the feature from\nfeatures.yml\non master.\nAdding, editing, or removing merged content blocks after the release date\nYou can make changes to the\nrelease post\nafter it‚Äôs live to make edits to feature content blocks.\nTo edit a content block:\nFind and edit the relevant\n.yml\nfile in the correct subdirectory. For example, to add or edit the example Widgets feature to the 14.6 release post, create or edit the\ndata/release_posts/14_6/widgets_example.yml\nin an MR against\nmaster\n.\nTo remove the feature block, remove the file in your MR. Or to announce it in the next release post, move the file to the\ndata/release_posts/unreleased\nfolder.\nFor review and approval, assign the current cycle‚Äôs\nRelease Post Manager\na Reviewer.\nTo edit a deprecation, follow\nEditing a deprecation announcement entry\n.\nAccountability\nYou are responsible for the content you add to the blog post\n. Therefore,\nmake sure that:\nAll new features in this release are in the release post.\nAll the entries are correct, especially with regard to links to the documentation or feature pages (when available).\nFeature tier availability: all contain the\ncorrect entry\n.\nAll primary features are accompanied by their images.\nAll new and/or primary features are added to\ndata/features.yml\nwith a screenshot accompanying the feature (if the feature is visible in the UI)\n.\nAll images are optimized according to the\nimage guidelines\nand\nsmaller than 150KB.\nKeep in mind the\nfeatures.yml\nis the SSOT for displaying features across\nabout.gitlab.com\n.\nAll features should have a clear value driver.\nAs noted in the\nRelease Post Item template\n:\nMake it clear if a feature is\nnew\n, or is an improvement to an existing feature.\nMake sure your content is reasonably aligned with guidance in\nWriting about features\n.\nEnsure that titles use sentence case with feature and product names in capital case.\nWrite the description of every feature as you do to regular blog posts. Please write according to\nthe\nMarkdown guide\n.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Important\nMake sure to merge\nmaster\ninto the release post branch\nbefore\npushing changes\nto any existing file to avoid merge conflicts. Do not rebase,\ndo\ngit pull origin master\nthen\n:wq\n.\nPMs checklist\nOnce the PMs have included everything they‚Äôre accountable for, they should\ncheck their item\nin the release post MR description:\nBy checking your item, you will make it clear to the Release Post Manager that you have done your part in time (during the general contributions stage) and you‚Äôre waiting for review. If you don‚Äôt check it, it‚Äôs implicit that you didn‚Äôt finish your part in time, despite that‚Äôs the case or not.\nOnce all content is reviewed and complete, add the\nReady\nlabel and assign this issue to the Engineering Manager (EM). The EM is responsible for merging as soon as the implementing issue is deployed to GitLab.com, after which this content will appear on the GitLab.com Release page and can be included in the next release post. All release post items must be merged on or before the Thursday, 1 week before release. If a feature is not ready by the Thursday, 1 week before release deadline, the EM should push the release post item to the next milestone.\nNotes for PMs\nVacations\nIf you are on vacation before/during the release, fill all your items and create placeholders in the release post Yaml file for all the items you cannot add for whatever reason. To complete them, and to follow up with all the content you are responsible for, assign someone to take over for you and notify the Release Post Manager.\nReplies\nPlease respond to comments in the MR thread as soon as possible. We have a non-negotiable due date for release posts.\nDocumentation\nPlease add the\ndocumentation_link\nat the same time you add a content block to the release post. When you leave it to add it later, you will probably forget it, the reviewer will ping you later on during the review stage, and you will have little time to write, get your MR reviewed, approved, merged, and available in\nthe documentation\n.\nPMM Reviewers\nMessaging review\nEach PM is responsible for pinging their PMM counterpart when they need a review on the messaging for a Release Post Item MR or changes to\nfeatures.yml\n.\nLeave comments for the PMs on the items file in the MR. Make sure to comment in the diff on the line that you are referring to so that the PM has the context and comments can be resolved appropriately.\nSee\nwriting about features\nas a guideline for what feature descriptions show have.\nReview the messaging for these features look for these 5 elements:\nproblem/solution\n: Does this describe the user pain points (problem) as well as how the new feature removes the paint points (solves the problem)?\nshort/pithy\n: Is this communicated clearly with the fewest words possible?\ntone clarify\n: Is the language and sentence structure clear and grammatically correct? Is the text in the present tense, and is ‚Äúyou‚Äù used instead of ‚Äúuser.‚Äù\ntechnical clarity\n: Does the description of the feature make sense for various audiences, including folks who are not deeply familiar with GitLab?\nvalue driver\n: Does the feature help our users Increase Operational Effectiveness, Deliver Better Products Faster, or Reduce Security and Compliance Risk?\nTo understand the feature better look at the issue and MR for the feature, they are linked in the YAML. Sometimes the issue description will include the value prop. Read the comments in the issue and MR for the feature, often users and customers will chime in with why they want a feature and what pain the lack of the feature is causing.\nThe release post and\nfeatures.yml\ncan have the same or very similar content - e.g. same screen shot.\nThe tone of the release post is more about introducing the feature ‚Äúwe‚Äôre happy to ship XYZ‚Ä¶‚Äù\nThe tone of\nfeatures.yml\nshould be\nevergreen\nto appear on our website in various places.\nPMM Lead\nPMM lead is responsible for creating a release post highlight blurb for consumption by field and PR.\nThe tasks are included in the\nrelease post MR template\nand in the\nmonthly release post intro document\n.\nOn or before the third thursday of the month:\nCreate\nnew Product marketing\nissue with PMM-Release-Post template.\nCreate release highlights - 3-4 themes with description. Use this document to document your highlights\nUpdate the issue with the highlights\nUpdate highspot\nAdd the actual release post blog as a new piece of content in Highspot (Customer Outreach spot) (e.g.,\nrelease post\n)\nAdd this new release post on highspot to the\nGitLab Releases spot overview page\nin the GitLab Release Post section\nCreate a new pitch template for this release in Highspot (Company Pitch Templates spot) (e.g.,\npitch template\n)\nAdd this new pitch template to the\nGitLab Releases spot overview page\nin the Release Pitch Templates section\nFlag to comms to share in #sales\nShare with the PR and Field enablement team and tag release post manager.\nTW Lead\nNote\nTechnical writers review the individual release post items according\nto the\nstage/group they are assigned to\n.\nEach month, one of the technical writers is also responsible for the structural\ncheck of the final release post merge request. This section is about the latter.\nThe TW Lead is responsible for a final review of:\nRelease post top feature\nFor any identified issues, inform the\nTW reviewer\nto resolve as appropriate.\nRelease post primary features\nFor any identified issues, inform the\nTW reviewer\nto resolve as appropriate.\nFrontmatter check\nVerifying the deprecations and removals sections in the release post link to GitLab the corresponding pages in GitLab Docs.\nWhile individual TW reviewers and product managers have ultimate responsibility for the style and language of their release post items, including\ndeprecations, removals, breaking changes\n, and\nUpgrades\n, TW leads still have an overall responsibility to notify the Release Post Manager, the product managers and TW reviewers if style and language don‚Äôt seem reasonably consistent (things are obviously out of sync with known guidelines). But it is not the responsibility of the TW leads to\nfix\nstyle and language inconsistencies. However, TW leads\ndo\nhave the responsibility and ownership to make sure that all links in the release post point to relevant content and be fixed, if issues are found.\nConsideration: When communicating with your release post team, use the release post prep channel and organize discussions into threads to make it easier to track conversations. Also, review GitLab‚Äôs\neffective slack communication\nguidance.\nStructural check\nA technical writer, once assigned to the release post merge request, will check the syntax and the content structure.\nThe\nStructural check\nchecklist in the main release post merge request description\nwill guide them through the structural check.\nGiven that the technical writing review occurs in release post items'\nmerge requests, the purpose of the structural check is:\nReview the overall post for consistency. For example, if there‚Äôs an entry in a previous release post that deprecates an item called\nauth-server\nfor this date, raise questions if there‚Äôs also an entry that removes an item referred to as\nauth_server\n.\nMake sure the post renders well.\nThe content as a whole clearly describes the new features and feature improvements.\nCheck all the links work and are in place.\nCheck all content for syntax errors, typos and grammar mistakes, remove extra whitespace.\nVerify that the images look harmonic when scrolling through the page (for example, suppose that most of the images were screenshots taken of a large portion of the screen and one of them is super zoomed. This one should be ideally replaced with another that looks more like the rest of the images).\nThis should happen in the release post item review, but if there‚Äôs time, double-check documentation links and product tiers.\nMake sure the current release‚Äôs deprecations and removals also show up in the\ndeprecations doc\n.\nPay special attention to the release post Markdown file, which adds the introduction.\nReview the introduction briefly, but do not change the writing style nor the messaging;\nthese are owned by PMMs, so leave it to them to avoid unnecessary back-and-forths.\nMake sure feature descriptions make sense, anchors work fine, all internal links have\nthe relative path.\nNote\nThe introduction or other parts of the release post written may include links to external\nblog posts. These links may be broken until the Wednesday, day before release, but should still be flagged by the TW Lead\nduring the structural check so the Release Post Manager doesn‚Äôt miss coordinating\nwith authors of these external blogs to ensure they‚Äôre live before the release post blog goes live\non the\nrelease date\n.\nThe Release Post is considered a special blog post instance, so should adhere to the Marketing\neditorial team‚Äôs\nstyle guide\n.\nMaking changes\nUntil 8:00 am Pacific Time on the Monday of release week, the TW Lead should be able to make changes\ndirectly to the release post. After that time, anyone who wants to include a\nchange in the upcoming release may need to submit it in a separate MR, with a\ntarget of the\nrelease-X-Y\nbranch. For more information, see\nDevelop on a feature branch\n.\nFrontmatter\nIn its\nfrontmatter\n:\nLook for each entry as shown on the code block below.\nRemove any remaining HTML comments and unused blocks to clean up the file.\nCheck the\ntitle\nlength. The title should be short and deliver an easy-to-understand message Ensure the title fits nicely with the blog post‚Äôs title graphic. A general guideline for title length is about 60 to 70 characters.\n---\nrelease_number\n:\ntitle\n:\n\"GitLab X.Y Released with Feature A and Feature B\"\nauthor\n:\n\"Name Surname\"\nauthor_gitlab\n:\ngitlab.com-username\ncategories\n:\nreleases\nimage_title\n:\n'/images/X_Y/X_Y-cover-image.ext'\ndescription\n:\n\"GitLab X.Y Released with XXX, YYY, ZZZ, KKK, and much more!\"\ntwitter_image\n:\n'/images/X_Y/X_Y-cover-image.ext'\n# required - copy URL from image title section above\nlayout\n:\nrelease\nfeatured\n:\nyes\n# header_layout_dark: true #uncomment if the cover image is dark\n# release_number_dark: true #uncomment if you want a dark release number\n# release_number_image: \"/images/X_Y/X_Y-release-number-image.svg\" # uncomment if you want a svg image to replace the release number that normally overlays the background image\n---\nLayout:\nThe last two entries of the post‚Äôs frontmatter give the option for a\ndifferent layout.

The process for TW reviews is described in the:\nRelease post item template\nDeprecation\nMR template\nUpdate the deprecations doc\nThe\ndeprecations\ndoc is generated with .yml files in\ngitlab/data/deprecations\n.\nThe html pages are not generated automatically. The TW assigned as the reviewer of the deprecation item must run a Rake task to compile the documents. They can also run a separate task to check that the docs are up to date.\nWhile the author of the deprecations MR is responsible for creating the content, they are not responsible for updating the doc.\nUpdating the docs:\nFrom the command line, navigate to your local clone of the\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nproject, and check out the MR‚Äôs branch.\nCompile the deprecation documentation\n.\nCommit the updated doc and push the changes.\nSet the MR to merge when the pipeline succeeds (or merge if the pipeline is already complete).\nDeprecation MRs must be merged by the Thursday, 1 week before release. If merged later, they might miss the code cutoff and won‚Äôt be included in the self-managed release‚Äôs docs.\nIf an entry needs to be edited,\nthe update process\nis similar.\nIf you run into problems running the Rake task, check\nthe troubleshooting steps\n.\nProduct Design Reviewers\nNote\nProduct Designers\nDRIs\nreview the individual release post items according to the\nstage/group each designer is assigned to\n.\nEach PM is responsible for pinging their Product Design counterpart when they need a review on the content or visuals within a release post.\nProduct Designers should collaborate on release post items and review:\n: Ensure that the messaging encapsulates how the item supports a user‚Äôs\nJob to be Done\n.\nMVC messaging\n: Articulate any design vision or future iterations if applicable. This is especially important when considering items that are\nunder construction\n, or contribute toward a Category‚Äôs maturity.\nArtifacts\n: Validate that UI elements (screenshots, GIFs) included in the post are up to date and reflect all design changes. Ensure that no mocks are used.\nEngineering Managers\nThe responsibilities of the Engineering Manager are documented in the\nEngineering Handbook\n.\nTechnical Advisors\nEach month, the Release Post Manager may need help with technical hurdles during the release post process. In order to provide the release post, which is a time-sensitive and highly visible asset for customers and users, with adequate technical advisement and support, we are piloting a partnership with the GitLab development team to leverage the\nDev Escalation process\nvia the Slack\n#dev-escalation\nchannel as an extension. This ensures that at all times, if something breaks that the release post team can not resolve themselves, they have access to technical experts for resolution. It is recommended that technical advisors review the documented\ntechnical aspects\nof the release post for reference, and the\nescalation process\n.\nPlease note that unlike other monthly volunteers of the release post, the technical advisor is not expected to follow the release post process at all times. The Release Post Manager will reach out to the technical advisor on call via Slack in the\n#dev-escalation\nchannel and then cross-post to the\n#release-post\nchannel for transparency that issues are being worked on. It is then expected that the technical advisor will respond to the Release Post Manager or release post DRI as soon as possible, including evenings/weekends, as the release post asks are often time sensitive,\nespecially between the Monday of release week and the\nrelease date\nof the month\n. The technical advisor is responsible for determining if further dev escalation should proceed.\nThe good news is that the release post technical hurdles are often reasonably easy to troubleshoot for technical experts, which is why we‚Äôre excited about this partnership!\nBelow are the types of problems the Release Post Managers may need help with.\nTriaging various\nautomations\nand\ntechnical aspects\nof the release post\nTriaging pipeline errors and suggest changes or provide a fix to related merge requests\nResolving merge conflicts with the release post\nIdentifying when to engage with other technical teams to resolve upstream problems\nGetting help during the Release Post Assembly\nRelease Post Manager\nShould you exhaust your ability to resolve your blocker quickly mention the Technical Advisor in\n#dev-escalation\nchannel and cross-post in\n#release-post\nchannel to ask for help, and make others aware that there may be a delay in assembly.\nDescribe your blocker in detail, screenshots, videos, etc. can assist in diagnosing the problem. Indicate whether your problem is urgent or not. If you indicate it is urgent, provide a clear date/time by which you need a response or resolution.\nTechnical Advisor\nWhat we have seen with previous challenges during the Release Post Assembly stage is some difficulty is encountered by the Release Post Manager because of a problem with their local development environment (Ruby setup, permissions, gems, etc.) or git conflicts. You should be familiar with git, Ruby, and the command line. There are a few resources that you can use to diagnose and resolve the issue at hand:\nReview the output of the assembly script including git status\nConsider running ./bin/doctor and review the output\nReference the\nlist of previous problems\nFollowing your best judgement with the resolution of the incident, record the diagnosis and the steps taken to resolve so that we can improve the release post process and our preparedness. Deposit this info in a new issue or as part of the current release post retrospective.\nAutomation\nWe have introduced\nscheduled pipeline jobs\nthat you should familiarize yourself with:\nA task will run on the Monday, 3 weeks before relea of the month that creates the monthly release post, MRs, and Issues to kickoff the Release Post (\npipeline configuration\n;\nrake task\n)\nAt\n4 pm UTC (11 am ET / 8 am PT)\n, a task will run that performs content assembly (\nscheduled pipeline\n;\nrake task\n)\nGetting help during the Release Post Deployment\nRelease Post Manager\nShould you exhaust your ability to resolve your blocker quickly mention the Technical Advisor in\n#dev-escalation\nchannel and cross-post in\n#release-post\nchannel to ask for help, and make others aware that there may be a delay in release post deployment.\nDescribe your blocker in detail, screenshots, videos, etc. can assist in diagnosing the problem. Indicate whether your problem is urgent or not. If you indicate it is urgent, provide a clear date/time by which you need a response or resolution.\nTechnical Advisor\nThe Release Post Deployment is a critical and time-sensitive operation. Please respond thoughtfully and quickly.\nFollowing your best judgement with the following:\nFor minor incidents that can be recovered from your intervention alone or in concert with the Release Post Manager, do so while recording your diagnosis and the steps taken to resolve the incident so that we can improve the process and our preparedness. Deposit this info in a new issue or as part of the current release post retrospective.\nFor major incidents that require immediate assistance from an SRE, developer on call, or other team members with increased access rights, create an issue and follow the\ndev escalation procedure\n. Record the diagnosis and the steps taken to resolve so that we can improve the process and our preparedness. Deposit this info in a new issue or as part of the current release post retrospective.\nIncident Response\nRelease post content assembly on the Monday of release week and release post deployment on the\nrelease date\nare time sensitive with multiple dependencies across various departments. GitLab team members often voluntarily go out of their way to assist with blockers found during these two time-sensitive procedures, but it can be confusing as to who is doing what to resolve an active blocking incident. Some procedural detail to our response efforts is shown below.\nResponse and Resolution SLOs\nDue to the time-sensitive nature of both key Release Post actions, assembly and deployment, the initial response time must be very quick, within 15 minutes. Incident resolution should also be as quick, within 60 minutes or less, if possible.\nThe Role of the Technical Advisor\nThe introduction of the technical advisor role is meant to be a coordinating role responding to blockers that occur along the way. They may work alone or in tandem with other volunteers to resolve the blocker as they see fit. They are also responsible for clearing the blocker, assembly of others, delegating response tasks including engaging in dev escalation.\nOwnership, Positive Control, and Intent\nThere should only be one owner of an incident at any given time. There must be clear understanding of who has control of actions to investigate and remedy the incident. Use positive exchange of control, that is pass control to another person who will now be in charge. The extreme example is from aviation where pilots exchange control in a manner like the following where you might hear ‚Äúyour airplane‚Äù to pass control followed by ‚Äúmy airplane‚Äù from the second pilot to accept control followed by the acknowledgement and release of control from the initiating pilot with ‚Äúyour airplane.‚Äù This avoids multiple people working at cross purposes from each other. Pilots operating an airplane is an extreme example, but it shows how to use clear language in your efforts to resolve the incident as to who is doing what. Only one person should be have control at a time. Similarly, the person taking action should declare their intent, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to merge master into the 13.8 release post branch and resolve any conflicts.‚Äù\nTimeline\nRelease Post Manager is blocked. Their initial attempts to get unblocked fails.\nRelease Post Manager joins\n#dev-escalation\n; mentions the Technical Advisor for this release detailing the nature of the blocker and its severity.\nTechnical Advisor acknowledges that they have seen the message and responds.\nTechnical Advisor creates a dedicated public Slack channel for communication around the incident like\nrelease-post-13.8-deploy-failure\n. That channel is then shared with\n#release-post\nfor others to follow along.\nBegin a Zoom call. Post the invitation to the Zoom room in the newly created Slack channel.\nTechnical Advisor assumes control from the Release Post Manager.\nInvestigation begins. Be as visible as possible, share your screen. Consider recording the Zoom session.\nAction taken.\nBlocker is resolved.\nClose Zoom.\nCollect screenshots, recordings, terminal history, comments in Slack, or other evidence on the issue.\nOpen a new issue to document the incident, deposit history, and add suggestions for corrective action or prevention. Link issue to the current release post retrospective.\nSee also:\nGoogle SRE Ch. 14\nManaging ongoing technical support tasks\nAnyone can contribute to technical issues that support the Release Post Process with the burden being mostly on the current volunteer tech advisor. The following outlines how to manage active and upcoming issues.\nTracking\nUse the\n~Release Post::Tech Advisor\nlabels for issues that require changes to the tools that facilitate the delivery of a release post. Create issues for lower priority challenges that arise during the milestone or as an artifact of decisions made during a retrospective. Creating an issue for immediate incident response isn‚Äôt required since the delivery of the release post requires quick resolution and synchronous communication.\nThis board\norganizes these labeled issues into a familiar software development workflow. When working on an issue, assign yourself and strive to keep the issue up-to-date with the proper workflow label and weekly async updates. Technical Advisors are welcome to make recommendations and apply milestones to the issues.\nHandoff\nIt‚Äôs unlikely that one technical advisor will serve in back-to-back milestones. Therefore, clearly communicating with the incoming technical advisor about the state of issues as part of release post retrospective and kickoff is a good idea. To do so:\ncreate a transition issue\nrecommend actions, prioritization, and milestones changes for any issues you are actively working\nunassign them from yourself and change the workflow label if you don‚Äôt plan on working on so it‚Äôs clear they need to be picked up\nafter your final rotation on the release post, reach out to the next tech advisor for a coffee chat to provide them with helpful information about any issues or bugs that are a priority for their upcoming cycle\nShould you prefer to continue to contribute to an issue under active development after your volunteer rotation, that‚Äôs great. In that situation, make it clear through assignments and issue updates that you will be the DRI.\nMonthly release blog post sections\nNotable Contributor\nFeatures\nTop feature\nPrimary features\nSecondary features (#secondary-features)\nIllustrations\n(screenshots, GIFs, or videos)\naccompanying their respective features\nUI improvements, performance improvements and bug fixes\nOmnibus improvements\n(added as a secondary feature)\nImportant notes on upgrading\n(optional)\nDeprecations and removals\nNotable Contributor\nThe Contributor Success team owns the process for nominating, selecting and adding the GitLab Notable Contributor (formerly MVP) for the release post. See the Contributor Success\nGitLab Notable Contributor Selection Process\n.\nThe Release Post Manager no longer has any Notable Contributor related tasks.\nFeatures\nThe most relevant features of the release are included in the post by\nproduct managers\n. Classify the feature according to its relevance and to where you want to place it in the blog post:\nTop feature\nThe top feature of the release is mentioned right after the Notable Contributor section, prior to other primary features. An image or video and documentation links are required. The\nTW lead\nwill pay close attention to the content of this item, as it is the ‚Äúheadline‚Äù feature for the release and it‚Äôs especially important to get it right.\nThe Release Post Manager will select a\ntop\nfeature. The following can be used as a guideline on which feature to select:\ntop\nfeature should:\nHave great user impact.\nAlign to the current FY product investment themes.\nCover all deployment types (.com, SM, and Dedicated).\ntop\nfeature can be:\nOnly for paid tiers (premium or ultimate only).\nBeta, but not\nexperimental\n.\nThe Release Post Manager will select a\ntop\nfeature and ask for feedback from the assigned VP of Product in #release-post together with reviewing the\nprimary\nfeatures. The Release Post Manager should incorparating feedback on any\ntop\nor\nprimary\nfeatures.\nTo specify the top feature, change\nprimary\nto\ntop\nin the selected feature‚Äôs release post item\n.yml\nfile:\nfeatures\n:\ntop\n:\nPrimary features\nFeatures with higher impact, displayed in rows after the top feature, with an image next to its text.

All release post Secondary features should be reviewed by the\nTW reviewer\n.\nIf the secondary feature is promoted to a primary feature, the PM or EM will be asked to supply an image on\nshort notice\n.\nTo identify the secondary features, look for\nsecondary\ndirectly beneath\nfeatures\nin the RP\n.yml\nfile:\nfeatures\n:\nsecondary\n:\nContent blocks\nNote:\n‚ÄúFeature blocks‚Äù are now known as content blocks, as there are many that are not just features. For example, we include upgrade warnings, Omnibus installer improvements, and performance enhancements.\nUse content blocks to add features or other content to the YAML data file. The layout will be applied automatically by Middleman‚Äôs\ntemplating system\n.\nContent blocks in the YAML data file contain the following entries, as exemplified below:\nfeatures\n:\nprimary\n:\n-\nname\n:\n\"Do great things with this feature\"\navailable_in\n:\n[\ncore, premium, ultimate]\ndocumentation_link\n:\n'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.html#multi-project-pipelines#multi-project-pipeline-visualization-premium'\nimage_url\n:\n'/images/topics/multi-project_pipelines.png'\nreporter\n:\nbikebilly\nstage\n:\nsecure\ncategories\n:\n-\n\"Application Security Testing\"\n-\nissue_url\n:\n'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/1234'\ndescription\n:\nUse present tense, and speak about \"you\" instead of \"the user.\"\nDescribe how the new functionality is beneficial. Use phrases that start with, \"In previous versions of GitLab, you couldn't... Now you can...\"\n[Add another link](#link) if needed.\nDescription\nContent of the\ndescription\nshould adhere to the Marketing editorial team‚Äôs\nstyle guide\n.\nDo not include UI navigation instructions in the feature‚Äôs description. These instructions should be\ncontained in the relevant documentation.\nFeature priority\nThe second line of the content block should indicate whether the feature is a top, primary, or secondary feature. For primary features, use the\nprimary\nkey as shown in the\nsample content block above\n. For secondary features, replace the\nprimary\nkey with the word\nsecondary\nand for the top feature replace\nprimary\nwith\ntop\n.\nFeature name\nname\n: feature name, capitalized\nUse a short and strong name for all feature names.\nFeature Availability\nUse the following pattern to apply the correct badge to the feature (Free, Premium, Ultimate) and to specify any add-ons (Duo Pro, Duo Enterprise).\nSubscription tier\nFor the subscription tier where the feature is available, use\navailable_in\nwith:\nFor GitLab Free,\n[core, premium, ultimate]\nFor GitLab Premium,\n[premium, ultimate]\nFor GitLab Ultimate,\n[ultimate]\nImportant note\n: The GitLab Free tier is listed as\ncore\nin the data file. This is intentional and the page templates will apply the proper tier name on the frontend.\nOffering (GitLab.com or self-managed)\nFor features available on both self-managed and GitLab.com:\nUse\ngitlab_com: true\n, or do not include\ngitlab_com\nin the yaml file.\nFor features available on self-managed only:\nUse\ngitlab_com: false\n. For example:\navailable_in\n:\n[\npremium, ultimate]\ngitlab_com\n:\nfalse\nThis setting greys out the orange badges on the GitLab SaaS row.\nFor features available on GitLab.com only, use\navailable_in:\nwith:\nFor GitLab.com Free,\n[free, silver, gold]\nFor GitLab.com Silver,\n[silver, gold]\nFor GitLab.com Gold,\n[gold]\nYou can also mix the GitLab.com badges with the self-managed badges. However, for this to work, the\ngitlab_com\nvariable must be set to\nfalse\n:\navailable_in\n:\nFor availability in all tiers on GitLab.com and only Premium and Ultimate tiers on self-managed, use\n[free, silver, gold, premium, ultimate]\nand set\ngitlab_com: false\nFor availability in the Silver and Gold tiers on GitLab.com and all tiers on self-managed, use\n[core, premium, ultimate, silver, gold]\nand set\ngitlab_com: false\nFor availability in the Gold tier on GitLab.com and only Premium and Ultimate tiers on self-managed, use\n[premium, ultimate, gold]\nand set\ngitlab_com: false\nAdd-ons\nTo specify a subscription add-on, enter text in the\nadd_ons: [ ]\nfield.\nEach entry adds a badge. For Duo Pro and Duo Enterprise, specify both. For example:\nadd_ons\n:\n[\n\"Duo Pro\"\n,\n\"Duo Enterprise\"\n]\nIf only Duo Pro applies, use\nadd_ons: [\"Duo Pro\"]\n.\nFeatures behind flags\nFrom time to time a feature may be developed behind a feature flag and made\navailable slowly\nto larger audiences. If this is the case, do not include the item in the release post unless you are deliberately seeking beta testers. This may result in a feature issue being closed in a milestone earlier than it is announced.\nIf you are deliberately seeking beta tests, include the release post as well as instructions on how to enable the feature and provide feedback.\nDocumentation\nProvide a link to the\nupdated\ndocumentation for the feature. It is a required field.\nIt can be, in this priority order:\nfeature documentation\nlink, when available\nfeature-related documentation\nlink, when a dedicated doc is not available\nImportant\nAlways link to the EE documentation, even if the feature is available in CE.\nNote:\ndocumentation_text\nwas deprecated by\n!13283\nfor GitLab 11.2.\nImportant\nEvery feature mentioned on the release post must link to an\nup-to-date document shipped in time, before the feature freeze.\n‚ÄúDocs or it didn‚Äôt happen!‚Äù\nIllustration (images, videos)\nimage_url\n: link to the image which illustrates that feature.\nRequired for top and primary features, optional for secondary features.\nimage_noshadow: true\n: if an image (\nimage_url\n) already has shadow\nthe entry\nimage_noshadow\nwill remove the shadow applied with CSS by default.

We can\nalso override it with a\ncustom stage URL\n.\nAlthough\nstage\nis a required field, if a feature doesn‚Äôt\nbelong to any of the stages at all, you can delete the\nstage\nline and it won‚Äôt output anything.\nBesides displaying the icon, with\nstage\nset, PMs can easily\nfind anything that is related to their area, even if reported by\nother users.\nNote\nteam\nwas\ndeprecated\nin December 2018 for GitLab 11.6 in favor of\nstage\n, with a follow-up iteration\nintroducing their\nrespective icons\n.\nCustom stage URL\nFor stages outside of the DevOps lifecycle, such as\nGrowth, which don‚Äôt have the same path as the other stages\n(\n/stages-devops-lifecycle/<stage>\n), it is necessary to add\nthe\nstage_url\nto the content block to override the default path:\n# Growth\nstage\n:\ngrowth\nstage_url\n:\n'/handbook/product/growth/'\nCategories\ncategory\n(array): Any category(ies) the feature belongs to. These are usually attached\nto the feature‚Äôs issue as labels. A list of categories can be found in\n/data/categories.yml\n.\nMake sure to add the category\nname\nexactly as typed on the data file.\nRelated issue, epic, merge request, or webpage\nissue_url\n: link to the issue(s) on GitLab.com where the feature is discussed\nand developed. Using this link the reviewer can check the status of the specific\nfeature for consistency and additional references. Avoid linking to a confidential\nissue so the wider community can get context about the change.\nIt is a required field, but can be replaced with\nmr_url\n,\nissueboard_url\n, or\nepic_url\n.\nAlways wrap links in single quotes (\n'https://example.com'\n).

For example,\n14-7-pseudonymizer-deprecation.yml\n.\nCreate a merge request using the\nDeprecations\nMR template for the change description.\nThe title must clearly explain the deprecation or planned change. For example:\n‚ÄúThe\nconfidential\nfield for a\nNote\nis deprecated.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe maximum number of characters in a job name will be limited to 250.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAccess tokens with no expiration date will be changed to have an expiration of one year.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe\nomniauth_crowd\ngem is deprecated.‚Äù\nThe description must:\nBe clear and concise.\nGive a brief explanation of the details or reasons for the change.\nThe description must also explain what the user must do as a result of the change. In other words, the entry\nmust\nbe\nactionable\nby users or admins. For example:\n‚ÄúUse the\ninternal\nkeyword instead of\nconfidential\n.‚Äù\n‚ÄúReduce the number of characters in all job names to be 250 characters or less.‚Äù\n‚ÄúGive an expiration date to any access tokens that have no expiration date.‚Äù\n‚ÄúStop using the\nomniauth_crowd\ngem. It will be removed and will not be replaced.‚Äù\nAvoid announcements like ‚ÄúFeature A is deprecated and will be removed. Wait until the replacement feature is released, and switch to it at that time.‚Äù\nIf the entry is not actionable, delay the deprecation or change announcement until there is an action available for users to address the change.\nAssign reviewers as recommended in the template.\nSet the\nbreaking_change\nvalue to\ntrue\nand add the\n~\"breaking change\"\nlabel to the MR. If the deprecation or planned change will not cause a breaking change (rare, but possible), use\nfalse\nand do not add the label.\nAssign the MR to the technical writer\nassigned to the stage\n.\nReviewing and merging the announcement\nThe TW Reviewer reviews the content, adds a commit that\nupdates the deprecations doc\n, and merges the MR by the Thursday, 1 week before release. After merging, the announcement will be visible on the\ndeprecations documentation page\nwithin an hour.\nIf the MR is at risk of missing the cut off date, open a duplicate MR and set the target branch to\nX-Y-stable-ee\nwhere\naligns with the version released\n. If you have trouble, ask for help in\n#mr-buddies\nor refer to the\nfull process for backporting an MR\n.\nAnnouncing an End of Support period\nThe\ndeprecation template\nprovides an option to end support for a feature prior to its removal. This option should only be used in special circumstances and is not recommended for general use. Most features should be deprecated and then removed.\nAn End of Support milestone must be at least 3 milestones\nafter\nthe deprecation announcement. For example, if the deprecation announcement is made in\n15.1\n, the End of Support milestone must be in\n15.4\nat the earliest. There is no requirement for the gap between the End of Support milestone and the Removal milestone.\nIf an End of Support milestone is announced, it will be displayed under the title of the deprecation announcement on the\nDeprecations page\n. End of Support milestones are not currently displayed in the release post.\nWhen to define an End of Support period\nIf there is a long period of time between the deprecation and the planned removal.\nIf supporting the feature during an extended deprecation period would affect engineering velocity (bloat, dependency management, etc.).\nCommunicating End of Support\nIf you decide to declare an End of Support period:\nCheck for any\nSupport Stable Counterpart\n(also listed on the\nproduct categories page\n) for your development group and tag them in the MR that adds a value to the\nend_of_support_milestone\n.\nIf your group does not have a Support Stable Counterpart, look for a stage or section Support Counterpart. If none, please post in the\n#support_leadership\nSlack channel with a link to the readiness issue (next line).\nPlease also open a Support Readiness issue\nfollowing the Support communications guidance\n.\nEditing an announcement entry\nThis process is very similar to creating an announcement entry, with the difference being that the YAML file already exists.\nTo edit an existing entry:\nCreate a new branch in the\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nproject.\nFind and edit the\n.yml\nfile in the\ndata/deprecations\ndirectory.\nCreate a merge request for the change, and use the\nDeprecations\nMR template for your change.\nAssign reviewers as recommended in the template.\nAssign the MR to the technical writer\nassigned to the stage\n. (By the Thursday, 1 week before release if revising an entry for the upcoming release)\nThe TW Reviewer reviews the content, adds a commit that\nupdates the docs\n, and merges the MR. (By the Thursday, 1 week before release)\nUpgrades\nTo be added by Product Managers or Engineering Managers and merged by Engineering Managers.\nDescribe any considerations administrators should have when upgrading to this version. These could be warnings about potential data loss, recommendations for maintenance beforehand, and other similar concerns.\nConsiderations for future upgrades should be noted in the\ndeprecations\nsections.\nOne notable example was in %12.10,\nwe required administrators to migrate from Postgres 10 to Postgres 11\n.\nUpgrade items go in the same directory as regular release post items. See the\nupgrade template\nto create an upgrade notice. Create one .yml file in the\n/data/release_posts/unreleased/\nfolder, using the following content block for each notice:\nupgrades\n:\n-\nreporter\n:\nbikebilly\n# item author username\ndescription\n:\n# example (supports markdown)\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.\nVeritatis, quisquam.\nApply the following labels to the MR:\nrelease post\nrelease post item\nrelease post item::upgrades\nFor review, select the\ntechnical writer\nassigned to the stage.\nWhen the MR is approved, add the\nReady\nlabel before merging.\nMajor releases\nMajor releases happen once a year and start a new versioning cycle: 14.0 - 14.10 ‚Äì> 15.0 and so on.  Contribution to and management of content for major releases follows the same schedule as\nmonthly releases\n. But for major releases, the Release Post Manager can expect some extra coordination and communication from the Social, PR, and Marketing teams, due to extra activities and needs for a major release. Additionally, during a major release, the Release Post Manager may need to support PM volunteers managing communication of removals that are breaking changes.\nCommunicating breaking changes\nProduct Operations will lead the communication of breaking changes for major releases as part of the release post. It is important the breaking changes be flagged for SaaS users prior to the rollout of the updates in the major version, so they are prepared and their workflow is not unexpectedly disrupted. Beginning as early as 3 milestones ahead of the major release, Product operations will start communictions/coordination for announcements and a\nbreaking changes blog\n. Starting as early as 2 milestones ahead of the major release, Product Operations we will use the\nbroadcast message feature\nto communicate upcoming breaking changes with SaaS users.\nProduct Operations initiates breaking changes communications when they‚Äôre assigned an\nautomated GitLab issue\n, with a task list and timeline. These communications rampup three minor releases before the major release. For example: if the major 15.0 release is planned for May 22, the communications rampup with the automated issue being generated  during release 14.8.\nAdding content\nFor entries that support Markdown, use regular\nMarkdown Kramdown\n, as we use for all blog posts and webpages on about.GitLab.com.\nIllustrations\nImages\nEach image should be compressed with\nImageOptim\n,\nTinyPNG\n, or similar tool. You can also try\nautomation tools like Hazel or Automator\nEach image should not surpass 150KB (300KB for cover\nimage), GIFs included\npngbot\nwill compress PNG images added in\nmerge request by converting each PNG to PNG 8 (8 bit, 256 colors) using\npngquant\nbefore losslessly compressing with\nzopflipng\n.\nApplication screenshots\n:\nMake sure that the application screenshot captures the feature to make it\nimmediately recognizable.\nInclude\nonly\nthe necessary UI context to allow the reader to identify where this\nfeature is available. Minimize empty space in a screenshot. You may need to make\nyour browser window smaller before taking the screenshot, to bring UI elements\ncloser together.\nCrop screenshots so that they are wide, not square, so that when they fill\nthe column width and do not take up large amounts of vertical space.\nAvoid resizing images. Ideally include the screenshot at native High DPI\n(Retina Display) resolution so that it is sharp when viewed on these displays\nReduce the number of colors in your screenshot using a quantizer like\nImageAlpha\n,\npngquant\n, or\nTinyPNG\n. Try reducing the number of colors to\nfewer than 256 colors (default) to increase savings. Small savings add up\nover many images.\nFinally compress your image using a lossless compression tool like\nImageOptim\n, or\nzopflipng\nto reduce the file size even\nfurther, saving an additional 5-20%.\nIn most instances it should be possible to reduce a PNG screenshot well\nbelow 100KB. Small savings on each image accumulate quickly and reduce the\npage load time significantly.\nScreenshots throughout the post should be harmonic and consistent in terms\nof their size and quality.\nAnimated GIFs\n:\nIf a GIF isn‚Äôt necessary, replace it with a static image (.png, .jpg)\nIf an animation is necessary but the GIF > 300KB, use a video instead\nCover image\n:\nCover images for 16.x releases have been created by the marketing team and can be found\nhere\nFor cover images after 16.x,\nraise a similar request\n.\nThis image should be eye-catching, inspiring and avoid images of people. The image should be landscape orientation, roughly 1920 x 1080, and no larger than 300 KB.\nTo test the image and see how it fits (without waiting for a build or running the handbook locally):\nNavigate to a previous release post\nUsing the web inspector find the element\n<div class=\"cover\" style=\"background-image: url();\">\nInside\nurl()\n, replace the string with the URL of the image (the actual URL of the image, you may need to right-click the image and select ‚Äúcopy image address‚Äù)\nHit the\nEnter\nkey and you should see the image render inside of your web browser\nImage shadow\n:\nwhen you add images though the text,\nmake sure all images have the class shadow applied:\n![image alt text](#img-url){:.shadow}\nIf the original image already has shadow applied, don‚Äôt use\n{:.shadow}\n.\nIf you‚Äôre inserting the image in the YAML file via\nimage_url\nentry, add the\nimage_noshadow: true\nentry\nright after\nimage_url\n.\nVideos\nYou can add videos to release post content blocks in two ways:\nBy using the\nvideo:\nentry in the content block\nBy including the video in the\ndescription:\nof the content block\nIn either case, the video must first be uploaded to\nGitLab‚Äôs Unfiltered YouTube channel\n.\nUploading videos to GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel\nWhen adding videos to content blocks, it is important to ensure that the correct video URL is used and that the video‚Äôs visibility settings are set to ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù. Follow the steps below to properly prepare a video for inclusion in a content block.\nUpload the video to\nGitLab‚Äôs Unfiltered YouTube channel\nMake sure that the visibility settings are set to ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù.\nCopy the video URL and add /embed/ to it.\nReplace\nyoutube.com\nwith\nyoutube-nocookie.com\n. This is the URL you will use in the content block.\nFor example:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\nbecomes\nhttps://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\nReview the auto-generated captions for your video, and clean them up for accuracy. Machine-generated captions often mangle technical terms.\nAdding videos to content blocks\nIn the content block, use the entry\nvideo:\nfollowed by the video‚Äôs URL\nvideo: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\nIf both a video and an image are present, the video will override the image and only the video will be displayed\nAdding videos to descriptions\nWhen adding videos to a content block description, it is important to use the correct markup to ensure that the video is displayed correctly.\nTo add a video to a description, wrap the video in a\nelement and add the class\nvideo_container\n. This assures that the video is displayed responsively. For example:\n-\nname\n:\n\"Awesome Feature\"\n...\ndescription\n:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quae, provident.\n<!-- Leave a blank line above and below the code below. Do not change the code block in any ways, except for the video URL. Leave the indentation as-is and do not remove the space prior to </iframe>. -->\n<figure class=\"video_container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"> </iframe>\n</figure>\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Quae, provident.\nTechnical aspects\nThe release post is created from many small data files, that are rendered into the final form using templates and helpers.\nThe content files need to be created every release with the content unique to that release, as described by the section\ngetting started\n.\nGetting started\nThe template and helper files are used to render the blog post from the many content files, and do not need to be changed in most releases.\nTemplates:\nLayout (Haml) file\n:\ncreates a layout for the final HTML file, and requires the include file below.\nInclude (Haml) file\n:\nbuilds the content of the post applying custom styles. Its markup includes semantic SEO improvements.\nHelpers:\nHelper (Ruby) file\n: when the release post is being rendered, the helper combines all the release post items into a variable that is used by the include (Haml) file. The output of the helper is consistent with single data file process used until GitLab 12.8.\nContent:\nData (YAML) files\n: each contain the content for one feature, improvement, or deprecation. Data files are added to the\nunreleased\nor\ndata/deprecations\ndirectories, and then moved to a\nrelease\ndirectory. The purpose of the helper (Ruby) is to combine these files when rendering the release post.\nBlog post (Markdown) file\n: the blog post file holds the introduction of the blog post and frontmatter (\ntemplate\n,\nexample\n).\nTo learn more how the template system works, read through an overview on\nModern Static Site Generators\n.\nTo run the project locally:\nIn the terminal, go to the\nwww-gitlab-com\nproject. Depending where you cloned it:\ncd\n/path/to/www-gitlab-com\nInstall dependencies:\nbundle install\nyarn\nRun Middleman\n.\nSee the release post locally, using\nhttps://127.0.0.1:4567/\ninstead of\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/\n. For example,\nhttps://127.0.0.1:4567/releases/2021/09/22/gitlab-14-3-released/\n.\nFeature order\nImportant note: Feature order should not be changed without approval from the Release Post Manager.\nPrimary feature content blocks are sorted alphabetically by file name so if necessary, the ordering can be affected by adding a 2-digit numerical prefix to the file name of each individual content block. For example,\n01_filename.yml\n,\n02_another_file.yml\n, etc.\nSecondary features are first grouped by stage and within each stage sorted alphabetically by title. Features with no specified stage are grouped last. In release 13.10 and prior, bug fixes, performance improvements, and usability sections were also part of this automated sort order. Starting with release 13.11, bugs, performance improvement, and usability sections were changed from secondary features to tertiary features, so they now will automatically come after the secondary features and prior to the Deprecations Removals and Upgrades sections.\nSometimes, the height of the secondary features content will be much longer in the left or right column, resulting in white space. In that case, you can force a block of content from the left to the right or vice versa by adding a\nforce_left: true\nor\nforce_right: true\nto an entry‚Äôs yml file. (\nSee this MR as an example.\n)\nRelease post branch creation Rake task\nThe release post branch and most of the related directories, files, issues, and MRs are automatically created when\nrelease:start\nRake task\nautomatically runs on the Monday, 3 weeks before release.\nIf the script fails to run or there are pipeline issues, you can run\nbundle exec rake release:start\nyourself to make the following things happen:\nYou are asked for the GitLab version (for example, 13.10), and the release\npost date in ISO format (for example 2021-03-22). The script then reads those\ntwo values and uses them in the templates that are mentioned in the next steps.\nIf one of them is missing, the script stops and exits.\nThe branch name is set to\nrelease-X-Y\n, which is based on the version you\nprovided above.\nThe script checks if the release branch already exists. If it does, it\nstops and exits. You‚Äôll need to delete your local branch (\ngit branch -D release-X-Y\n)\nif you want to re-run the script.\nGit stashes your current changes, if any, checks out\nmaster\n, and pulls from\norigin\n(this should be the default remote pointing to the\ngitlab-com/www-gitlab-com\nrepo,\nyou can check with\ngit remote -v\n).\nThe script then creates the new release branch.\nThe\nintro\nis created by using the template under\ndoc/templates/blog/monthly_release_blog_template.html.md\n. It replaces the\nstub X.Y values with the version you provided in the first step and adds the author name and handle.\nThe data directory for the release is created under\ndata/release_posts/X_Y/\n.\nIf it exists, the script stops and exits. You‚Äôll need to delete this directory\nif you want to re-run the script.\nThe\nNotable Contributor (MVP) template\nis used to create the Notable Contributor (MVP) file (\ndata/release_posts/X_Y/mvp.yml\n).\nThe retro issue is generated and assigned using the\nRelease-Post-Retrospective template\nThe script performs a find and replace to update the following values in all of the MRs and Issues above using content from\ndata/release_post_managers.yml\n:\n@release_post_manager\n:\nmanager\n@tw_lead\n:\nstructural_check\n@tech_advisor\n:\ntechnical_advisor\n@pmm_lead\n:\nmessaging\nThe script performs a find and replace to update occurrences of\n,\nwith the appropriate values based on the current date and milestone.\nRelease post item generator\nThe\nrelease post item generator\nautomates the creation of release post items using issues and epics. Issues and epics are the source of truth for what problems are being solved and how, and should have a clear description, and be well labeled. The script uses this information to pre-fill release post item MRs:\nIssue/Epic element\nRelease Post Item Attribute (yml) or MR element\nIssue Title\ntitle:\nLabel\ndevops::\nstage:\nLabel\ngroup::\nassigns group product manager as reporter, and tags\nrelevant team members in the MR\nlabel\ncategory:\ncategories:\nLabel\nrelease post item::\n(\nprimary\n/\nsecondary\n)\ncontent block type\nprimary:\nor\nsecondary:\nLabel tier (e.g.\nGitLab Core\nGitLab Premium\nGitLab Ultimate\n)\navailable_in:\nIssue web url (i.e.\n/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/####\n)\nissue_url:\nIssue description under\n### Release notes\ndescription:\nwill contain all text except for the\ndocumentation_link\nand\nimage_url\ndocumentation_link:\nis the first URL in the\n### Release notes\nsection containing\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com*\nimage_url:\nis the first image added to the\n### Release notes\nsection. (e.g.\nImage: ![name](/path/)\n)\nImportant note:\nGitLab Free tier is referenced as\ncore\nin the data file. This is intentional and the page templates will apply the proper tier name on the frontend.\nTo ensure the generator script runs correctly follow the process below:\nMake sure the issue is open.\nMake sure the issue is not confidential. If you need to link to a confidential issue you will need to manually create the Release Post Item Merge Request as the\nrelease post item generator\ndoes not currently create MRs from confidential issues.\nUpdate your issue or epic with content in\n### Release notes\n(including a docs link and image, although those can always be added/updated in the MR later) specifically having it contain both a\nDescription:\nthen a\nDocumentation:\n.\nMake sure there is only plain text in the content beneath\n### Release notes\n. If there is any additional formatting, the script will fail.\nMake sure\ndevops::\n,\ngroup::\n,\ncategory:\nand tier (e.g.\nGitLab Core\n) labels are applied\nApply one of the\nrelease post item::\nscoped labels. This will make the generator script pick up your issue next time it runs (once per hour)\nOnce the script runs a draft MR in the\n/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com\nproject will be opened and assigned to the group PM. You can continue editing and reviewing that MR from there.\nIf you‚Äôd like to check to see when the last pipeline ran (and if it picked up your issue), you can inspect the scheduled pipeline\nhere\n.\nYou can also watch\nthis overview video\ndemonstrating how to use the\nrelease post item generator\n.\n*Note: If you find problems with the\nrelease post item generator\n, questions should be posted in Slack #release-post or add feedback to the release post retrospective issue, tagging the release post\ntechnical advisor\n.\nThe generator script can also be run on your computer.\nClone the\nwww-gitlab-com\nproject, and install dependencies using\nbundle install\nRun the script, providing your GitLab private access token, and the issue URL:\n=\n<token> bin/release-post-item --no-local <issue_url>\nRefer to\nbin/release-post-item --help\nfor complete documentation.\nRelease post item linting\nThe\nrelease post item linter\nvalidates all items being merged to the\ndata/release_posts/unreleased\ndirectory meet minimal\nstandards. Specifically, it checks:\nYAML can be parsed\nConformity to\nschema\nEach file contains exactly one item (e.g. feature or deprecation)\nContent blocks have valid fields\nDeprecations have valid fields\nThe\nstage\nfiled maps to a valid stage key in\ndata/stages.yml\nThe\ncategories\nlist only contains valid category names from\ndata/categories.yml\nIt does not check if:\ntop\nand\nprimary\nitems have an image or video\nissue_url\nis supplied, since there are other alternatives\nThe schema is implemented using\nRx\n.\nDeprecation rake task troubleshooting\nIf you have trouble running the rake task, you can check the following troubleshooting steps:\nVerify that your Ruby version matches the\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nproject‚Äôs Ruby version\n. You can check with\nruby -v\n. See more about\nsetting up a Ruby environment\n(MacOS only). You can also validate your setup by running\n./bin/doctor\nfrom the terminal.\nUpdate your gems by running\nbundle install\n.\nYour bundler version could be out of date, so you can try running\ngem install bundler:2.1.4\n.\nResolve merge conflicts in deprecations.md\nIf you rebase the branch of a deprecations or removals MR, there might be multiple merge conflicts in the\ndeprecations.md\nfile. Do not resolve individual\nmerge conflicts from your IDE. Instead, use the removals rake task to update the file and resolve the merge conflicts.\nTo resolve merge conflicts:\nIn the branch you checked out in the\ngitlab-org/gitlab\nproject, run the deprecations Rake task:\n# For deprecations\nbin/rake gitlab:docs:compile_deprecations\nStage your changes:\ngit add .\nContinue the rebase:\ngit rebase --continue\nIf you get merge conflicts after you continue the rebase, it‚Äôs possible that\ndeprecations.md\nis still out of date with\nthe latest changes in the\nyml\n. If this occurs, complete the steps again until you clear the merge conflict.\nRelease post merge request template\nThe\nrelease post MR template\nis our checklist for every release. Let‚Äôs keep it up-to-date! :)\nAdding deprecations and removals index to\nwww-gitlab-com\nIn order to display a list of deprecations and removals in the Release Post, an index must be generated from the\ngitlab\nproject and added to\ndata/release_posts/xx_y\nin the\nwww-gitlab-com\nproject.\nOpen a terminal in the\ngitlab\nproject\nRun\nbin/rake gitlab:docs:write_deprecations\nEnter the relevant milestone when prompted\nManually copy and paste the generated files into the corresponding\n/data/release_posts/xx_y\nin the\nwww-gitlab-com\nproject\nAdd\ndeprecations:\nto the first line of the deprecations index\nChange all instances of\nname:\nto\nfeature_name:\nin both files\nPatch and Security release posts\nThe Delivery team is responsible for creating release posts for\npatch\nand\nsecurity releases\n.\nRelease posts should live in\nsites/uncategorized/source/releases/posts\n. For patch and security releases,\nplease make sure to specify them in the title, add the correct\ncategory\n:\nPatch releases:\ntitle: \"GitLab Patch Release: x.y.z and x.y.z\"\ncategories: releases\nSecurity releases:\ntitle: \"GitLab Security Release: x.y.z and x.y.z\"\ncategories: releases\nCreating an MR for What‚Äôs New entries\nVideo walkthrough of the process\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new‚Äù can be seen by clicking on the\n?\nicon in the navigation menu of GitLab and choosing ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new.‚Äù\nThe What‚Äôs New MR will be initiated by the Release Post Manager on the Tuesday of release week, finalized on the Wednesday of release week, and typically get merged by a\nmaintainer\n2 to 4 hours AFTER the release post is live on the\nrelease date\n. The exact timing of the merge depends on the availability of a\nmaintainer\nto merge it**\nOn the Tuesday of release week, the Release Post Manager creates the What‚Äôs New MR.\nThe RPM will pull all of the final/approved primary items in the release post to feature in  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù\nThe selected items can but do not have to align with the primary features of the release post. If the RPM feels comfortable making a unique selection, they may do so.\nIt is recommended to strive for a balance of features available to both free and paid users. If we only include Ultimate features, non-Ultimate users may stop engaging.\nThe Release Post Manager will create a new MR in the\ngitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\nproject\nUse this\ntemplate\nto create a new file in the\ngitlab/data/whats_new\ndirectory.\nTitle the file as\nYYYYMMDD0001_XX_YY.yml\n- for example, the 13.4 entry is titled\n202009300001_13_04.yml\n.\nUsing the content that is in the release post items, duplicate the content for What‚Äôs New.\nSometimes it is necessary to trim down the description. Keep in mind that these should be short, and generally a single paragraph.\nSaaS-only features need to use\n[free, premium, ultimate]\nin the What‚Äôs New MR instead of\n[free, silver, gold]\nor\ncore\nas is used in the release post items. We will streamline this discrepancy in the future, but for now, the RPM should update the values as necessary when creating the What‚Äôs New MR.\nStage names are case-sensitive, so be sure that the stages are capitalized in order for the pipeline to pass.\nImages are not required, but encouraged when possible.\nFor videos, you will need to provide an image. For YouTube videos, you can use the image URL, which can be found by inserting the youtube unique ID into this format:\nhttps://img.youtube.com/vi/[insert-youtube-video-id-here]/hqdefault.jpg\n. For cases where a video thumbnail doesn‚Äôt look great, consider using a generic image from\nthe\nsource/images/growth\ndirectory\n.\nImages will end up at a URL like\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/images/X_Y/XXXXXXX.XXX\nMake sure you provide a full URL for the YAML entry. Ex:\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/images/13_7/reviewers_sidebar.png\n.\nIf an image is not available, you can use a generic image (ex:\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/images/ci/gitlab-ci-cd-logo_2x.png\n) or omit the image_url.\nBefore committing the MR,\ncheck the YAML with a validator\n.\nAdd the ~‚Äúdocumentation‚Äù label.\nApply the affiliated release\nmilestone\n(it‚Äôs ok if it says ‚Äúexpired‚Äù) and labels\nwhats new\nand\nrelease post\n.\nOn the Tuesday of release week, when the MR is ready for review, assign\n@[name of PLT member who is reviewing this month]\nas reviewer and\n@mention\nthem in the MR to complete their review by the Wednesday of release week. The name of the PLT member who is reviewing this month can be found on the\nrelease post scheduling page\nAfter the release post is live and you have verified the images load locally in GDK by pulling down the What‚Äôs New branch, have the MR reviewed following our standard\ncode review process\nand have it merged by a\nmaintainer\n. It is recommended to communicate directly to the maintainer that the MR is time sensitive to avoid unnecessary delays.\nOpen a duplicate MR and set the target branch to\nX-Y-stable-ee\nwhere\naligns with the version released\n. Assign it to the same maintainer that merged the previous MR. This second MR ensures that any additional releases to version\ninclude this ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù update. If you have trouble, ask for help in\n#mr-buddies\nor refer to the\nfull process for backporting an MR\n.\nIMPORTANT: The MR should not be merged until after the release post is live on the\nrelease date\nor the images will not display.\nAfter the release post is live, but before merging, the branch should be checked out and the content checked in GDK to make sure that all images are displaying, links are accurate, and that the What‚Äôs New items are part of the final release post. Only once those are confirmed should the MR be merged.

We are committed to leveraging the GitLab platform, embodying the pinnacle of internal usage (‚Äòdogfooding‚Äô) practices.\nAligned with GitLab‚Äôs overarching information security strategy and its three-year plan, the Product Security Department (PSD) within the Security Division is responsible for crafting and directing a comprehensive vision to bolster the cybersecurity posture of the GitLab platform.\nWhat is Product Security at GitLab?\nAt GitLab, product security encompasses a broad range of cybersecurity disciplines that enable product and engineering teams to design, develop, deploy, maintain, and refine GitLab‚Äôs technologies securely. This goes beyond the conventional confines of security, covering everything from protecting developer workstations to ensuring the integrity of our production environments.\nThe Product Security Mission\nOur mission is to set the standard for product security by fostering a culture of rapid innovation and secure product delivery. We are committed to leveraging the GitLab platform, embodying the pinnacle of internal usage (‚Äòdogfooding‚Äô) practices. By maintaining close collaboration with product teams and contributing significant security features and capabilities to the GitLab codebase, we aim to enhance our operations and be a vital driver of the broader GitLab vision.\nMulti-Year Product Security Mission\nOur comprehensive,\nmulti-year product security mission\ncan be found in our internal handbook.\nProduct Security Risk Register\nOur Product Security Risk Register process details can be consulted on\nthis dedicated page\n.\nCollaboration is Key\nSuccess in product security is not confined to PSD or even the Security Division. It requires a concerted effort across the entire GitLab ecosystem. Collaboration is crucial, involving not just our security counterparts but the broader organization. Key disciplines and capabilities, from Security Operations to Site Reliability Engineering, while not directly under PSD‚Äôs purview, are vital to our strategy‚Äôs success.\nGuiding Principles\nBusiness Enablement\n: PSD‚Äôs role is to facilitate GitLab in achieving its business goals by ensuring product teams can operate both efficiently and securely, bolstering customer trust, and utilizing transparency as a strategic advantage. This includes providing insightful product feedback through extensive dogfooding.\nEmpathy and Accessibility:\nRecognizing that the optimal security solution may not always align with business or customer needs, PSD prioritizes understanding and empathizing with these unique perspectives. This empathetic approach guides our security practices and engagements, aiming to align our methods with the preferences of our customers and internal teams.\nPragmatism Over Perfection:\nAddressing current challenges quickly and effectively is preferred over waiting for a perfect solution. PSD focuses on delivering incremental, tangible value through rapid, short-cycle initiatives, aiming for partial solutions that immediately benefit our long-term goals.\nDesign for Rapid Iteration:\nOur strategy and roadmaps are crafted to quickly identify and learn from suboptimal decisions by engaging with customers and stakeholders early and maintaining a tight feedback loop. This approach helps us adapt and refine our strategies and approaches efficiently.\nData-Driven Decision Making:\nData drives our objectives, priorities, and actions, reducing the risk of failure or scope creep. Example useful metrics include root cause analyses of incidents (data within), threat modeling outcomes, and production readiness assessments, among others.\nScalability and Repetition:\nPSD emphasizes scalable, repeatable processes over bespoke solutions, ensuring we can meet growing demands without proportional increases in resources.\nDecentralization and Empowerment\n: Acknowledging that product and engineering teams possess deep, specialized knowledge of their domains, PSD advocates for these teams to take ownership of security tasks like secure code reviews and threat modeling. This decentralization fosters a more integrated and effective security posture across GitLab.\nIntegration with Reliability, Quality, Infrastructure, and Platform Engineering:\nPSD‚Äôs mission to mitigate product security flaws is inherently tied to improving overall product quality and reliability. We aim to leverage and integrate with the practices of existing teams to enhance both security and product excellence.\nTeams\nThe Product Security sub-department includes the following teams. Learn more about each by visiting their Handbook pages.\nApplication Security\nInfrastructure Security\nVulnerability Management\nSecurity Platforms and Architecture\nData Security\nProduct Security Department Label Standardization\nThe Product Security Department has standardized its labeling system to improve issue tracking, team identification, and cross-team collaboration across all security teams.\nMandatory Division and Department Labels\nAll issues, epics, and merge requests within the Product Security Department must include the\n‚ÄúDivision::Security‚Äù and ‚ÄúDepartment::Product Security‚Äù\nlabels.\nTeam-Specific Labels\nEach team uses a standardized naming convention :\nApplication Security\n: ~‚ÄúApplication Security Team‚Äù\nInfrastructure Security\n: ~‚ÄúInfrastructure Security Team‚Äù\nData Security\n: ~‚ÄúData Security Team‚Äù\nVulnerability Management\n: ~‚ÄúVulnerability Management Team‚Äù\nProduct Security Engineering\n: ~‚ÄúProduct Security Engineering‚Äù\nSecurity Platforms & Architecturee\n: ~‚ÄúSecurity-Platforms-Architecture Team‚Äù\nMultiple team labels can be applied to issues requiring collaboration\nApplication Security\nApplication Security home page\nData Security\nGitLab's Data Security team investigates and remediates known unknowns in our data security and privacy posture.\nInfrastructure Security\nGitLab's Infrastructure Security provides security oversight of the SaaS.\nSecurity Logging Overview\nSecurity Logging supports and develops GitLab's security log ingestion platform.\nSecurity Platforms & Architecture\nSecurity Platforms & Architecture Team Charter\nSupply Chain Risk Management Strategy\nThis page outlines GitLab's comprehensive approach to supply chain risk management, providing a structured framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across the software development lifecycle while advancing toward higher SLSA compliance levels.\nVulnerability Management\nVulnerability Management is the continual process of identifying, prioritizing, mitigating and ‚Ä¶\nLast modified July 1, 2025:\nFix SPA label (\n25c5952f\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 906}

The team will update Workday.  The notice is used as supporting documentation of the change and is saved in the team members Workday record.\nVoluntary Terminations\nPrior to Resignation\nTeam Member:\nPlease reach out to your Direct Manager prior to submitting your resignation particularly to discuss the handover process and the\ncommunication plan\nregarding your departure.\nTeam Member:\nReview the documented\nnotice period\nfor your location if applicable and factor in the notice period when submitting your resignation through Workday.\nTeam Member:\nCompile your Letter of Resignation for uploading into Workday.  If you are employed through a PEO or Third-Party Employer, send a copy of your resignation letter to the PEO contact as well.\nResignation\nTeam Member:\nFollowing the guidelines in the ‚ÄòHow to Submit a Resignation‚Äô\nJob Aid\nsubmit your resignation directly in Workday accessible through Okta.\nTeam Member:\nAfter your resignation is submitted in Workday, your manager will receive a request to complete your offboarding in Workday. Once your termination is complete, you can anticipate receiving your offboarding packet with information regarding your final pay, continued benefit offerings, and additional offboarding information such as returning your devices.\nTeam Member:\nYou should review the\nOffboarding FAQ\nhandbook page to address any questions you may have. If you have a question that is not on that page, please reach out to the People Operations Team using\nHelpLab\n.\nNote: You will not see your offboarding issue prior to your departure as this is an issue used to deprovision access and is created once you are done working.\nCountry Specific Requirements for Resignation\nFrance\nIn addition to submitting their resignation directly in Workday (following the guidelines in the ‚ÄòHow to Submit a Resignation‚Äô\ne-Learning\nor\nJob Aid\n) and complying with any contractual requirements, Team Members resigning in France should also email a copy of their resignation letter to\nlegal-employment@gitlab.com\n.\nGermany\nIn addition to submitting their resignation directly in Workday (following the guidelines in the ‚ÄòHow to Submit a Resignation‚Äô\ne-Learning\nor\nJob Aid\n), Team Members resigning in Germany are required to provide a wet-ink signed resignation letter to the\nGmbH address\nand should liase with the People Operations team during offboarding to ensure it‚Äôs properly provided.\nJapan\nTeam Members located in Japan who are resigning need to complete\nthis resignation form\nand send it to payroll via\nHelpLab\nby the 10th of the month in order to process this with the local provider/partner for correct taxations. Please download or make a copy of the document in order to complete.\nSingapore\nTeam Members located in Singapore who are resigning and are\nnot\nSingapore citizens need to complete a Letter of Undertaking\ndocument\nand send it to payroll via\nHelpLab\nin order to process this with the local provider/partner. Please download or make a copy of the document in order to complete.\nTeam members the the PEO/EOR on UAE work visa‚Äôs who resign, completes their contract, or changes jobs, their visa must be cancelled by the company regardless of whether they leave the UAE. Team member‚Äôs with dependents must first either cancel dependent visas (if dependents are leaving the UAE) or place them on hold (if dependents are staying) - this is managed by the team member as the dependent visa sponsor. The PEO/EOR company handles the mandatory work visa cancellation process through MOHRE (for labor card) and GDRFA (for residence visa), which takes 1-3 working days. Team members have 30 days after cancellation to leave the UAE or obtain a new visa. Failure to cancel properly may result in re-entry bans, overstaying fines, and complications with final payroll and health insurance processing.\nTermination\nManager:\nIf your team member completes a resignation in Workday, you will receive a prompt in your Workday inbox to terminate the team member by following the steps documented in the following\njob aid\n. If a resignation was not submitted, you should initiate the termination by going to the departing team member‚Äôs Workday Profile and selecting\nActions\nfollowed by\nJob Change\nand finally\nTerminate Employee\n.\nNote\n: Submitting the termination in Workday does not immediately terminate access. The offboarding issue, which is opened on the team members last day worked, initiates the deprovisioning process for terminated team members.\nManager:\nYou will be prompted to indicate whether the termination is regrettable or non-regrettable:\nNon-Regrettable i.e. The team members departure has a minimal impact on the company, its customers, its projects or the team - the team member has not been meeting expectations due to conduct, culture or values misalignment or performance concerns.\nManager:\nOnce the details about the team members departure have been finalized schedule time with the team member to plan the\ndeparture announcement\n. Please reach out to your PBP if you need additional guidance.\nPeople Business Partner:\nYou will receive a prompt in your Workday inbox to review the termination details submitted by the Manager and to close the position in Workday. If you are aligned with the details including the final date of employment click\nApprove\n.  In the instance that you feel further discussion is required a sync with the Manager and/or Team Member should be arranged and the termination can be sent back for further review.\nPeople Ops:\nOnce the transaction has been fully approved the team will receive a notification of the termination within the Workday Inbox.\nOffboarding\nPeople Ops:\nOn the Last Day of Work as indicated in the Workday Termination Report at the\npre-determined time\nthe offboarding issue will be\ncreated\n- this will signal to all system owners that team member access can be revoked.  In the instance that the automation does not trigger the offboarding can be\ninitiated manually\nonce this has happened all other back-end offboarding processes facilitated by People Operations can get underway.\nDeprovisioners (Systems):\nYou will be tagged in the departing team members offboarding issue and required to indicate that the team members access has been revoked kindly note that access to SOX Systems must be attended to with urgency and all other tasks within the offboarding issue must be closed out within five days.\nInvoluntary Terminations\nNote:\nInvoluntary terminations are\nonly\nfacilitated by Team Member Relations (TMR) who will initiate the process in Workday.\nInvoluntary offboarding of any team member is never easy. We‚Äôve created guidelines and information to make this process as humane as we can. Beyond the points outlined below, make sure to refer to our guidelines on\nunderperformance\n, as well as the\noffboarding issue\n.\nInvoluntary Process\nThe manager and the team member should have walked through the guidelines on\nunderperformance\nbefore reaching this point.\nManager\n: Reach out to the their TMR specialist for assistance.\nTMR will ask about what the performance issues have been, how they have been attempted to be addressed, and review all manager/team member documentation.\nOnce the review has been completed and the decision has been made to offboard the team member, the manager should review the best timing for the involuntary offboarding call and termination date. We recommend to avoid scheduling a involuntary offboarding call while a team member is scheduled for any sensitive customer meetings or is on-call, per guidance below under Last working day.\nTMR will enter and approve the offboarding in Workday. Once entered, the relevant offboarding stakeholders will receive an alert via Workday reports or a Workday notification.\nTMR will work with IT in a separate Slack channel.\n: TMR will create a private Slack channel that will include the PBP, Manager, and Leader of the organization to review the offboarding and agreed upon offboarding date.\n: If applicable, TMR will prepare the severance agreement in preparation for the call between the TMR specialist, Manager, and team member. Additional guidelines for the preparation of this agreement can be found below in the\nSeparation and Release of Claims Agreements\nsection. To determine whether or not a severance agreement is applicable, please refer to the\nSeverance Eligibility\nguidelines accessible by PBPs, and Team Member Relations Specialist.\nManager\n: Once the date and time is confirmed, the manager will schedule time with the team member and send the TMR specialist a\nprivate and separate calendar invite\nwith the Zoom details for the meeting with the team member to share the news of the offboarding.\nPayroll\n: If the team member is employed by a PEO/entity with statutory leave requirements, review if any time off needs to be paid on the last paycheck by looking in Workday in the\nTime Off\nsection.\nPayroll\n: If the team member has a contract with a co-employer, the payroll lead will forward an email to the contact at the co-employer with the information surrounding the departing team members statutory leave etc.\nTMR/Manager\n: Discuss best mode of communicating the bad news to the team member. This discussion can happen via a private chat-channel, but it is best to be done via video.\nTMR/Manager\n: Decide who will handle which part of the conversation, and if desired, practice it.\nIf needed the TMR will provide the manager with a script for the offboarding meeting.\nTMR/Manager\n: If the team member who is being terminated is a people manager, a\ncommunication plan for the team\nregarding the departure should be in place before the offboarding proceeds. The communication plan should include: identification of an interim leader, (ideally) a scheduled meeting with the interim leader for the direct reports, a scheduled team call to announce the current manager‚Äôs departure and the interim leadership, and finally an announcement in the\n#team-member-updates\nSlack channel to share with the wider team.\nImportant:\nInforming the team and answering questions should be the top priority.\nNo announcement should be made in the\n#team-member-updates\nSlack channel until the team call has been completed.\nIn most cases, a team call can occur the same day of the offboarding. If necessary, the offboarding can be announced in the\n#team-member-updates\nSlack channel the following day.\nTMR/Manager\n: Decide what offboarding actions need to be taken\nbefore\nthe call (e.g. revoke admin permissions), or\nduring\nthe call (e.g. revoke Slack and Gmail access), and which ones can wait until later. You can reference the\noffboarding issue template\nfor the full list of actions. This conversation should take place in the private Slack channel with PBP, Manager and Leader.\n: If the team member is a risk to the production environment, the TMR should privately reach out to the\nInfrastructure Managers\nto determine who will be available to assist with the offboarding. Once an infrastructure team member has been identified, they should be added to the private calendar invite sent to People Operations, Security, and Payroll to hold the time for the team member offboarding. Once the offboarding conversation starts the TMR will privately Slack the infrastructure contact the name of the team member to start the offboarding process.\nFacilitating the Call\nManager\n: Deliver the bad news up-front, do not beat around the bush and prolong the inevitable pain for everyone involved. The Manager will make it clear that the decision is final, but will also explain what led to this decision and will point to the process that was followed to reach this decision. A sample leading sentence can be\n‚ÄúThanks for joining the call, [team member name]. Unfortunately, the reason I wanted to speak with you is because we have decided that we have to let you go and end your employment / contract with GitLab because of xyz.‚Äù\nManager\n: Hand the call over to the TMR to continue.\n: The TMR will also make it clear that the decision is final, but also will genuinely listen to the team member‚Äôs side of the story since there may be useful lessons in what they say for the rest of the team e.g. regarding hiring and vetting practices.\n: Make sure to communicate the\npractical points\nfrom the offboarding memo outlined below.\n: Once the conversation is complete, the TMR will stage the involuntary offboarding email document along with the severance document in DocuSign for review and signatures.\nCritical Points During Offboarding Call\nAll Team Members\nFinal Pay:\n‚ÄúYour final check (or invoice period) is for the pay period of X and includes X days of pay‚Äù.\nCompany Property:\n‚ÄúPlease return all property as explained in the handbook, also please delete GitLab‚Äôs email connection from your phone‚Äù.\nBusiness Expenses:\n‚ÄúPlease create your final expense report to Navan Expense (for employees), OR, please file any outstanding expenses with your final invoice (for contractors), so these can be reimbursed to you in a timely manner‚Äù.\nConfidentiality and Non-Disclosure:\n‚ÄúWe know you are a professional, please keep in mind the agreement you signed when you were hired‚Äù.\nPersonal Particulars:\nIf you would like GitLab to share your personal email with the rest of the company, please send an email to People Ops or a farewell message that can be forwarded on your behalf.\nUS Team Members\n‚ÄúYour benefits will cease on last day of the month you are eligible for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (‚ÄúCOBRA‚Äù), the carrier (Lumity) has been notified and the carrier will send out the paperwork to your home address on file‚Äù.\n‚ÄúYou may also be eligible under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (‚ÄúPPACA‚Äù) for subsidized health care options via the marketplace.\nIf you are interested it is important that you sign up with the market place well before the 15th of the month to have coverage for the following month‚Äù.\n\" Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), if you need a certificate of credible coverage please download it from your current carrier‚Äôs online portal or request it from People Ops\".\nUnemployment Insurance:\n‚ÄúIt is up to your state‚Äôs labor agency (in CA: EDD) to decide if you are eligible for unemployment insurance‚Äù.\nKeep GitLab Informed:\n‚ÄúIf you move I want to be sure your W-2 gets to you at the end of the year.\nYou may also contact X at GitLab (provide phone number and email address) with any other questions that you may have‚Äù (consider inviting them to contact you at anytime for any reason).\nInitiating an Involuntary Termination in Workday\nTerminate the team member in the system by following the steps documented in the following\njob aid\n(Workday Profile by selecting\nActions\nfollowed by\nJob Change\nand finally\nTerminate Employee\n).\nYou will be prompted to indicate whether the termination is regrettable or non-regrettable and whether the team member would be eligible for re-hire in future or not i.e. with review unless specifically relating to\nconduct\nor\njob abandonment\nin which case they would not be eligible.\nOnce you have submitted the termination details, you will be prompted to complete a Questionnaire confirming that the Manager or PBP have communicated termination to the business AND confirming that access has been shut off with IT.\nPeople Business Partner:\nYou will receive the termination transaction to review, approve, and then enter a comment to confirm termination is ready for the offboarding process to begin.\nIf PBP does not want the offboarding process to initiate they should NOT approve the termination until they‚Äôre ready.\nPeople Ops:\nwill review all comment(s) and questionnaire to confirm the offboarding process is ready to begin. If needed, the Peopel Operations team member should reach out to the PBP to confirm the process can be initiated. This will complete the process of the involuntary termination.\nLast Working Day\nAfter the involuntary offboarding call has taken place and the last working day has been determined, team members will have no access to GitLab systems and may not be required to do any work on GitLab‚Äôs behalf.\nIf they are on ‚ÄúGarden Leave‚Äù they will still be active on payroll through the termination date. When determining the timing of the involuntary offboarding call and termination date it is important to consider any effect this might have on ongoing tasks and responsibilities of the team member. No expenses may be incurred while on garden leave unless necessary to the performance of GitLab duties and approved by the team member‚Äôs manager or as subject to local law.\nAs a manager, in collaboration with the Team Member Relations Specialist (TMR) and/or the People Business Partner (PBP), we recommend to avoid scheduling the involuntary offboarding call while a team member is scheduled for any sensitive customer meetings or is\non-call\n. If this is unavoidable, the manager is responsible for ensuring a transition/remediation plan.\nPeople Engineering automations\nwill generate the offboarding issue at the end of the team member‚Äôs last working day, as per notification from the Team Member Relations Specialist (TMR) and the People Business Partner (PBP). Once the\nLast Working Day\nor Garden leave expires the team member will be officially offboarded from GitLab.  Prior to the offboarding issue and the overall process for the term listed below.\nLast Working Day for US Team Members\n: TMR will have a legal/CPO review of the planned offboarding.\n: TMR will inform payroll, compensation and benefits, security and the stock administration of the date the team member will have access suspended and the official offboarding date prior to the opening of the offboarding issue.\n: TMR will work with People Operations team to ensure the offboarding issue has the correct dates and that all stakeholders in Payroll, Compensation and Benefits (Total Rewards), Security and Stock Administration have been communicated to and understand the offboarding details.\nSample Offboarding Memo\nIf appropriate (to be determined by conversation with the manager, the Group Executive, and People Ops), use the following\noffboarding memo\n, which is provided here as an openly viewable Google Doc, but of course needs to be personalized and tailored to each individual‚Äôs situation.\nAs written, it is applicable to US-based employees only.\nSeparation and Release of Claims Agreements\ndo not\napply for all offboardings. To review in which cases they do/do not apply, please reference the\nSeverance Eligibility\ndocument accessible by Team Member Relations team and PBPs. In the case that a severance agreement is applicable, the steps below should be followed:\nSeverance Process for US-based Team Members\n: The TMR Partner/Specialist assigned to the particular offboarding case at hand should select the appropriate severance template. Options include: Non-California over 40, California over 40, Non-California under 40, California under 40.\n: The TMR Partner/Specialist should make a copy of the template and save it in the\nCopies of Individual Severance Agreements\nfolder.\n: The TMR Partner/Specialist should fill out the document.\n: The TMR Partner/Specialist will ping the stock team in the stock option section of the document.\n: The TMR Partner/Specialist will share with the PBP and Legal for final review/approval.\n: The TMR Partner/Specialist will stage the document in DocuSign for signatures. Please note that depending on the template used, team members have a limited amount of time to sign the Separation and Release of Claims Agreement.\nWhen staging the document for signatures, please note:\nRemember to send the document to the team member‚Äôs\npersonal\nemail address\nSelect the\nassign signature order\noption in DocuSign to ensure the team member signs the document first\nAll US (Inc.) severance agreements should be signed by Karen Iacobucci, VP, People Operations & Technology. If Karen is unavailable then Robert Allen, CPO will be responsible for signing.\nUS (Federal LLC.) severance agreements need to be signed by an appropriate team member within the Federal Entity.\n: When the signed document is received, the TMR should upload it to the team member‚Äôs Workday Profile in the documents tab.\n: As a final step, the TMR specialist will email the appropriate\nuspayroll@gitlab\nor\nnonuspayroll@gitlab\nand total rewards that the final severance agreement has been uploaded to the team members Workday Profile in the documents tab.\nImportant Notes:\nSeparation pay is not paid until the ex-team member signs the document and the revocation period has passed.\nWe treat team members equally and therefore do not take tenure into consideration when determining separation pay unless legally required. We know that other companies sometimes gives higher separation pay to longer tenure. We think that a short tenure can be harder to explain to a next employer and with a shorter tenure you might have less stock option upside, maybe you have not even reached your vesting cliff.\nMake sure you understand the rules for over 40.\nYou must use language in your exit meeting that is in no way forceful of the ex-team member to sign the agreement. Use phrasing such as ‚Äúif you choose to sign‚Äù; ‚Äúyou have a right to have legal council review this document before you sign‚Äù, etc.\nTeam Member Leave during an Investigation\nFor team members who will be placed on leave during an investigation please follow the process below:\n: Communicates with Legal, Aligned PBP regarding the decision to place a team member on leave and disable accounts during an investigation.\n: TMR will request IT support for disabling a team members accounts.\n: TMR schedules a call with the team member and manager to inform them of the decision to place the team member on leave while an investigation occurs.\n: TMR informs the manager and PBP when the conversation is completed and accounts are disabled. During this period managers will not have access to the team members accounts.\n: TMR notifies IT that an Out Of Office message needs to be set on the account and include the message that the team member is OOO and please reach out to their manager.\n: TMR send the team member to their personal email the ‚ÄúTeam member Suspension letter‚Äù via DocuSign. The TMR will upload this document to the team members Workday Profile in documents tab.\n: TMR once the investigation is completed the TMR will inform the aligned PBP and manager of the final decision. If the team member is to be returned to work the TMR will reach out and schedule time to meet with the team member.\n: If the team member is returning to work the TMR will notify IT that the team member will be returning from leave and the date that accounts should be enabled.\nOffboarding Compliance\nThe People Operations member in the relevant rotation will complete a weekly audit of all offboarding issues opened within that specific week and check that all People Operations tasks have been completed and that the label\npeopleops::done\nhas been added.\nAll offboarding tasks by all Departments need to be completed within 5 days of the offboarding date. For systems that are more critical and time sensitive, these will be completed within the first 24 hours (example 1Password, Slack) by the relevant Departments. Information about application & system deprovisioners can be found on the\nTech Stack Applications handbook page\n.\nTo ensure a successful completion of the offboarding issue, it is important that all tasks are checked off, whether the system/tool is applicable to the offboarding team member or not. Checking the box indicates one of the following:\nI have revoked team member access to this particular system/tool\nI have checked and this team member was not given access to this particular the system/tool.\nGitLab Alumni Program\nAll voluntary exits are eligible to be added to the Slack channel\n#gitlab-alumni\n, unless otherwise noted. Involuntary exits are not eligible for the alumni channel, unless otherwise noted by Team Member Relations.\nThe offboarding details provided by the termination transaction in Workday is how eligibility is determined and later shared with IT.\nThe purpose of this channel is to network and socialize with team members.\nJoining the channel is voluntary and subject to GitLab‚Äôs\nCode of Conduct\n.\nGitLab, the company, monitors the channel and can remove people from it at their sole discretion.\nThe GitLab\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nis enforced in the channel.\nCommunicating Departures\nOur goals in communicating offboardings are transparency, and to provide an opportunity for team members to say goodbye. We understand that different individuals are comfortable with different levels of communication and that each offboarding situation has different situations and nuances. For this reason and out of respect for individuals, we have a couple of key guiding principles for communicating offboarding:\nWe ask that all offboardings are announced in the\n#team-member-updates\nSlack channel for transparency and awareness. While we encourage all offboardings to be posted in #team-member-updates, we recognize there may be select situations that we should consider a different approach for. If a team member or their manager does not want to post in #team-member-updates, please discuss with your\nPeople Business Partner\nor\nTeam Member Relations\n.\nTeam members and managers have the discretion to determine who shares the news of the team member‚Äôs offboarding (I.E. team member or manager). Regardless of who shares, it is required that team members review offboarding messaging with their managers prior to sharing.\nDepending on the team members‚Äô role, timing of communication may vary (e.g. direct team, key stakeholders, etc.), and managers have discretion to determine who should be informed most immediately. The typical order followed for communicating departures is:\n1. Inform Direct Team\nThe ‚Äúdirect team‚Äù is typically the team member‚Äôs peers within their immediate team (I.E. reporting to the same manager and/or in the same functional group, etc.) and is typically a relatively small group of people.\nIn most cases, team members communicate their departures to their direct team, though messaging should be cross-checked with their manager for consistency.\n2. Inform Key Stakeholders\nKey stakeholder communication can be done through 1:1 notifications, and/or by posting the update in team-specific channels for general awareness. Key stakeholders are individuals that departing team members work very closely with (typically in their day-to-day work) that will feel the impact of the team member‚Äôs departure in their work. Managers of key stakeholders should also be looped into communication to ensure awareness.\nIt is essential that key stakeholders are looped in to offboardings to:\nCommunicate go forward plans\nEnsure business continuity and transparency\nDepartures should be communicated with stakeholders as soon as possible, with a maximum timeframe of 2 business days after the team member‚Äôs departure.\nWhere possible and appropriate, we also encourage managers to work with departing team members to align on transitions plans to transition as much of the departing team members‚Äô work as possible before their departure.\nIn most cases, managers communicate team member departures to key stakeholders.\n3. Announce In #team-member-updates\nAs explained briefly in the\noffboarding issue\n, GitLab is not always able to provide full context on why people are leaving when they do.\nHowever as mentioned in the procedures, for\nvoluntary offboarding\n, the team member can work with their manager on messaging to share a company-wide message about their departure.\nOnce the news has been shared with the team member‚Äôs team and other stakeholders, and messaging is agreed upon between the departing team members and their manager, the departure message should be shared in the\n#team-member-updates\nSlack channel.\nManagers and team members can optionally leverage this template as a guide on how to communicate a team member‚Äôs upcoming departure:\nI want to share that [team member's name] ([group] [role]) will be leaving GitLab, and [his/her/their] last day is (date of their last day). (Context to add about the team member's time at GitLab - examples: their favorite contribution to the handbook or they can use the update to express gratitude towards teams and individuals that have made their experience at GitLab positive.) I would like to take this opportunity to thank (team member's name) for their contributions and wish them all the best for the future. If you have questions about tasks or projects that need to be picked up, please let me know. If you have concerns, please bring them up with your manager. To keep in touch with (team member's name) he/she/they can be reached at (contact info - e.g. LinkedIn, email, etc.)\nThere will be situations in which team members prefer to share their offboarding message, and situations in which managers prefer to do so. Either is ok,\nso long as team member and manager have reviewed the messaging together prior to posting\n.\nIf someone is let go involuntarily, this generally cannot be shared since it affects the individual‚Äôs privacy and job performance is intentionally kept\nbetween an individual and their manager\n.\nIf you are not close to an employee‚Äôs offboarding, it may seem unnecessarily swift.\nPlease remember that these decisions are never made without following the above process to come to a positive resolution first - we need to protect the interests of the individual as well as the company, and offboarding is a last resort.\nAccording to our values\nnegative feedback is 1-1 between you and your manager\nand we are limited in what we can share about private employee issues.\nPlease discuss any concerns you have about another employee‚Äôs offboarding with your manager or your People Business Partner.\nGiven the expectations and responsibility that come with a VP and above position, when there is an involuntary offboarding for one of these positions, additional context for the personnel change can be provided to the organization.\n4. Inform The Department\nManagers should consider cross-posting the message in #team-member-updates to inform the wider Department of the departing team member.\nWhat Do We Share?\nWe strive to maintain personal information regarding all team members private, this includes information regarding a team members voluntary or involuntary departure from GitLab.\nHowever, a manager with the consent and approval of the departing team member can share more details with the GitLab team regarding the decision to leave GitLab. If the departing team member gives their manager permission to share that information then the manager will share while making the departure announcement on the team call.\nRegarding involuntary offboarding, certain information can also be shared with the GitLab team regarding the departure.\nThe departing team member may work with their manager to author a goodbye message for voluntary offboarding:\nWork with your manager on the message that your manager will share in\n#team-member-updates\non Slack.\nSend it to your manager for approval. If, as a manager, you are in doubt about the message - please reach out to your manager or\naligned People Business Partner\nfor additional review.\nManagers are encouraged to use the suggested template (above link) and have the space to add more color wherever they see fit.\nIn some instances there will be no further clarification on why a team member has departed, if there are concerns you can address those with your manager.\nDifferent levels of transparency will exist based on maintaining respectful treatment for all departures. Having team members leave may be a learning opportunity for some, but should not be a point of gossip for anyone. Managers will need to balance the opportunity for learning with the expectation of privacy and consult their People Business Partner should they have questions.\nTransparency is one of our values. In the case of offboarding, we opt to share the feedback only with peers and direct reports as needed, since we balance transparency with our value of collaboration and\nconstructive guidance\nshared 1-1.\nTurnover Data\nGitLab‚Äôs\nturnover data\nis only viewable internally.\nManaging the Offboarding Tasks\nOffboarding Issue\nTo track all tool deprovisioning, please open an offboarding issue following the\noffboarding standards\n.\nReturning Property to GitLab\nAs part of offboarding, any GitLab property valued above 1,000 USD needs to be returned to GitLab.\nFor laptops, please check and refer to the\nLaptop Buyback Policy\nwhich states that team members\nmay\n, at GitLab‚Äôs discretion, have the option to keep or buy back their existing laptops either when it gets refreshed for a new one, or when the team member is offboarding.  However, the option to purchase or keep a laptop at no cost may be voided where the team member is involved in cases of investigation, misconduct, termination for cause of any violation of\nGitLab‚Äôs Code of Business Conduct & Ethics\n, or other legal or security related inquiries.\nTo return your laptop to GitLab, please contact\ngitlab-laptop-recovery@gitlab.com\nimmediately upon offboarding.\nNavan Expense\nThis section of the Accounting Department.\nTo remove someone from Navan Expense Log in to\nNavan Expense\nand go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù in the left sidebar.\nSelect the right policy based upon the entity that employs the team member. Select ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù in the left menu.\nSelect the individual‚Äôs name and click ‚ÄúRemove‚Äù.\nIf the person has a Corporate Credit Card assigned to them, please notify Accounts Payable before un-assigning it.\nRetrospective for Managers\nFor involuntary offboardings it is optional to do a retrospective on the hiring, onboarding and coaching/communication of the departing team member. As a manager, you can use\nthis template\nfor a retrospective. Please share the filled out template with your manager as well as the\nPeople Business Partner\nfor your group.\nWithin the Engineering division this is a\nrequired process\nbecause it causes hiring managers to reflect on what led to the ultimate decision of parting ways with the team member, and how that might be prevented during future hiring processes.\nEvaluation Framework\nHow could this outcome have been avoided?\nWere there early signs that were missed?\nIn retrospect, what questions should have been asked to bring awareness and ownership to performance issues e.g.\n‚ÄúHow would you compare yourself relative to your peers‚Äù\n? - people are surprisingly honest here.\nUnemployment Claims\nUnemployment Claims in the US\nIn the United States, Unemployment Insurance provides benefits to GitLab team members who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The purpose is to provide temporary financial assistance to employees who meet certain requirements.\nUnemployment insurance is administered at a state level and in compliance with Federal Law. Each state establishes its own eligibility criteria and regulations surrounding Unemployment Insurance with respect to the amount allocated, duration and eligibility for Unemployment Insurance.\nEligibility criteria include meeting the state specified requirements in terms of both earnings and time worked during the base period. In some instances the state may require additional supporting information particularly more extensive wage related details surrounding a claim.\nUnemployment Insurance is funded through employer contributions and most states will have State Unemployment Taxes that apply however many employers typically pay the State Unemployment Taxes too.\nReporting a False Unemployment Claim\nIf you are a full-time team member and you are contacted by your state‚Äôs Unemployment Commission to discuss your request for Unemployment Benefits, you may be a victim of Unemployment Claim Fraud.\nBefore giving out any information to the caller, please confirm that you are speaking with an agency employee. If you confirm with your state‚Äôs Unemployment Commission that there is a fraudulent claim, please report it via\nHelpLab\nto the People Operations team.\nAdditionally here is a link to the\nU.S Department of Labor Contact Particulars\nto report Unemployment Insurance Fraud.\nGitLab Offboarding FAQ\nCommon Questions about the Offboarding Process\nGitLab Offboarding Standards\nOffboarding process and steps on the backend\nLast modified July 7, 2025:\nUpdating reference to People Connect to People Ops - offboarding & YouTube (\na03d9503\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 6016}

We seek to support resolution across a wide range of topics, including responding to subpoenas and discovery requests, drafting and revising legal documentation, managing investigations and negotiating and drafting agreements. It is our goal to proactively address and resolve these matters in support of GitLab‚Äôs business objectives, coordinating with internal business partners across the company whenever appropriate.\nHow to get in touch with RMDR\nIn support of these goals, we adopt this mantra:\nif you see something, say something!\nIf the question is of a general nature and does not require legal advice or discussion of confidential information, you can reach out to this team in Slack at #legal. We find this channel best for questions regarding process, who handles what, or how to find certain things if the handbook has not yielded the right result for you after searching. #legal is not a private channel, so your inquiry will be visible to the entire company.\nYou can also email\nrmdr@gitlab.com\nfor matters where Slack may not be the appropriate forum to discuss.\nWhen to get in touch with RMDR\nThere are times when GitLab team members must immediately consult with RMDR to ensure that GitLab is managing its legal risks effectively. These include:\nIf a team member receives a communication from a third party (i.e., a customer, vendor, partner, etc.) accusing the company of wrongdoing or demanding money from the company.\nA team member is not permitted to bind the company to pay money to settle a dispute without signoff from a member of the Legal and Corporate Affairs team.\nIf a team member receives a communication from an attorney representing a third party of any type, or other similar legal notice.\nIf another party involves an attorney, GitLab must involve its RMDR team.\nIf a team member suspects wrongdoing within GitLab.\nRMDR can confidentially discuss such matters with the appropriate legal resources, as necessary.\nIf a team member has questions about the legal or regulatory landscape.\nIn the case of an emergency that may have legal implications, such as a cybersecurity incident or major system failure.\nIf in doubt, please involve RMDR earlier rather than later ‚Äì we would always rather be proactive than reactive. You can reach out to RMDR via\nrmdr@gitlab.com\n.\nPrivilege\nSee the\nLegal & Corporate Affairs internal handbook\nfor links to a\nvideo\nand\npresentation\nwith additional information about privileged communication.\nPrivileged communication is communication, written or oral, that is protected from later disclosure in litigation because it was conveyed to the attorney in confidence by a client\nfor the purpose of\nseeking\nlegal advice\nor by an attorney\nfor the purpose of\ngiving\nlegal advice\n. Privilege can also be asserted over certain confidential documents created by attorneys for the same purpose.\nThe terminology differs depending on the jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, the privilege is generally referred to as ‚Äúattorney-client privilege‚Äù for communications made to or from an attorney for the purpose of providing legal advice or ‚Äúattorney work product‚Äù for communication or documentations created in relation to actual or anticipated litigation. In many of our EMEA and APAC countries, it may be called ‚Äúclient legal privilege,‚Äù ‚Äúlegal professional privilege,‚Äù ‚Äúlegal advice privilege,‚Äù or ‚Äúlitigation privilege.‚Äù Additionally, the scope of the privilege differs by country. It is therefore likely that the status of a privileged communication that contains legal advice in respect of foreign law will be determined by reference to the law of the country in which any action is taken.  If you have jurisdiction-specific questions about privilege, please contact a LACA team member who sits in that jurisdiction.\nPractically speaking, this means that communications between our team members and members of LACA are not necessarily privileged just because a member of the LACA team is involved. As a threshold matter, the LACA team consists of both attorneys and non-attorneys. Communications may be privileged if the person wishing to assert the privilege can establish that the communication was made to an attorney of the LACA team and the\ndominant purpose\nof the communication was to seek legal advice. Conversely, if the dominant purpose of the communication - even if made to an attorney - is simply to seek business advice, it is very unlikely to be privileged. Additionally, otherwise privileged communication will lose its privilege in most circumstances if it is further or also disclosed to third parties. Thus, team members should always be aware of who has access to the communication and should be very careful about forwarding it.\nWhat are some tips for team members to follow to help maintain privileged communication? Below are the steps you can take to help ensure that any communications you have with GitLab‚Äôs LACA team can be considered privileged:\nWhen seeking legal advice in writing from an attorney in GitLab LACA, label the subject line of the email and the top of the email, document, or Slack message: ‚ÄúCONFIDENTIAL & PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION‚Äù.\nEnd the communication by asking your attorney for a legal opinion and analysis. Simply including the attorney on a request for business advice will not create privilege.\nWhen seeking legal advice orally, it should be clearly noted at the commencement of the discussion that its purpose is to enable you to obtain legal advice.\nDo not disclose the contents of your communications with GitLab‚Äôs attorneys to anyone outside the company without consent of the attorney with whom you have exchanged the privilege communication, including friends or family members, and notify GitLab LACA department at ‚Äô\nlegal@gitlab.com\n‚Äô if any person from outside the company asks you to divulge privileged or confidential information.\nFor more information, please see the internal handbook\nhere\n.\nLegal Hold\nA legal hold is the process GitLab uses to preserve all forms of relevant evidence, whether it be emails, instant messages, physical documents, handwritten or typed notes, voicemails, raw data, backup tapes, and any other type of information that could be relevant to an investigation, pending or imminent litigation or when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Legal holds are imperative in preventing spoliation (destruction, deletion, or alteration) of evidence which can have a severely negative impact on a company‚Äôs case, including leading to sanctions. Once GitLab becomes aware of an investigation or potential litigation, a GitLab attorney will provide notice to the impacted team members, instructing them not to delete or destroy any information relating to the subject matter of the investigation or potential litigation. The legal hold applies to paper and electronic documents. During a legal hold, all retention policies must be overridden. Your obligation to follow the procedures outlined in the notice continues until the hold is lifted, even if you depart the Company. If you depart the Company, all Company owned devices and any material you are holding in accordance with any active Legal Hold Notice or active Company investigation should be turned over upon your departure.\nLast modified March 12, 2025:\nUpdate privilege internal handbook mention (\n3189ec39\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 1224}

{"doc_id": "af4a4508703f9408", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement", "title": "The GitLab Procurement Team | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nFinance\nThe GitLab Procurement Team\nWhat is Procurement?\nThe Procurement team manages GitLab‚Äôs\nSupplier Lifecycle\nthrough the process of strategically vetting and selecting vendors, negotiating commercial terms, the purchasing of goods and services, and managing the renewal or vendor offboarding process.\nProcurement Team Alignment\nDivision alignment for spend over >$25k USD / year:\nMarketing - Ashley Abbate\nSales - Ashley Abbate\nProduct - Adrienne Ruhaak\nEngineering - Adrienne Ruhaak\nPeople - Adrienne Ruhaak\nFinance - Adrienne Ruhaak\nLegal - Adrienne Ruhaak\nAll division spend <$25k USD - Dasha Yarmusik\nIndividual Software Purchases - Anam Shaikh\nShared Goals\nProcurement is a cross-functional team that supports GitLab as a public company. We have four key objectives monitored in the following ways:\nStrategic partnerships with business stakeholders - meet on a quarterly basis to review new or renewing third party spend and supplier management opportunities\nMetric(s): Supplier segmentation tiers\nAchieving annual cost avoidance (soft) savings and year over year (hard) savings\nMetric(s):\nSoft Savings\n(cost avoidance) is mitigating proposed cost increases or any negotiations for new purchases.\nHard Savings\n(year over year) is a decrease in cost from last year and is only valid for renewals. This can include decreasing unit costs, removing users and/or scaling back services and scope\nThird party risk management\nand ensuring we are getting the best commercial terms with the least amount of risk for GitLab\nMetric(s): the number of active and new vendors each quarter, and reported and monitored via internal and external audit\nResponsible sourcing/purchasing and supplier diversity - managed through the Zip and Coupa onboarding and purchasing process\nMetric(s):\nZip SLAs\nand diverse suppliers\nVendor Lifecycle Management\nThe Procurement team is responsible for ensuring there is a process for suppliers to be managed throughout their lifecycle of doing business with GitLab from initial selection and contracting to recurring reviews and renewals to cancellation.\n1. RFP and Vendor Selection\nAll new spend, changing of vendors for existing services, and market reviews every 3 years for existing contracts should follow the\nRFP and Vendor Selection process\n, unless approved by your Procurement Category Manager, to ensure we are choosing the best partner for GitLab with the best commercial terms. This must be done prior to verbally agreeing to terms or contracting with any new or existing vendor.\nFollow the RFP process outlined in the\ninternal handbook\n. You will find resources and templates for RFP events at any level, whether it is a quick bid or a full procurement-led RFP with 5+ vendors. Always reach out to your Procurement Cateogry Manager to notify them that an RFP is being conducted- they can assist in the process and can answer any questions.\nAs part of this process, create an issue with the\nRFP Intake template\nand tag your\nCategory Manager\n.\nBefore sharing details and/or confidential information regarding GitLab business needs, obtain a\nMutual Non-Disclosure Agreement\nfrom the potential vendor(s). Refer to the\nSignature Authorization Matrix\nfor signing authority.\nAll vendors must adhere to the\nGitLab Partner Code of Ethics\n. It is mandatory all vendors contractually adhere to this if they would like to do business with us. (Note these are typically not required in event related agreements unless the vendor is providing services).\n2. Negotiation, Privacy, Security, and Compliance Review\nDepending on the amount of spend, Procurement will assist or lead in negotiating the pricing and commercial terms of the contract.\nDepending on the types of data shared with the vendor, Privacy and Security will need to complete a review of the vendor. Depending on nature of vendor‚Äôs services and/or whether the vendor has been recommended to us, the Ethics and Compliance team will need to complete an anticorruption/antibribery review and, potentially, recommend additional measures to mitigate that risk.\nFor more information on these requirements and steps, see the\nReview Steps, Timeline, and Considerations section\n3. Contracting\nAll work that is done with a vendor must have a completed contract to be compliant and work may not be started until a contract is in place. Contracts include\nNDAs\n, Master Service Agreements and Statements of Works. Our legal team assists with this step in the process. Please see the\nlegal review process\nfor more details.\nAdditionally, please note that a small number of team members can sign agreements on behalf of GitLab - please see the\nAuthorization Matrix\nfor more details.\n4. Vendor Onboarding\nIn order for vendors to be paid, they need to complete their onboarding in our systems. Please see the\nNew Vendor Onboarding\nsection for more details.\n5. Recurring Vendor Reviews and Management\nProcurement will work with you through the Quarterly Procurement & Business Spotlights to review upcoming renewals and cancellations, new spend projects, and identifying\nvendor‚Äôs segmentation tier:\nStrategic, Niche, Commodity, or Transactional.\nIdentifying the Segmentation Tier your supplier(s) falls within helps determine the right vendor management approach, e.g. renew the contract, RFP, business reviews on a recurring cadence, continuous improvement plans, etc.\nIf holding a business review with a vendor, the following topics should be discussed:\nSuccess criteria of the contract\nWhat is going well\nWhat can be improved\nReview of any issues and remediation expected\nOverview of the contract and its utilization\nVendor Renewals\nOn a quarterly basis, the Procurement team will meet with business stakeholders in each department to review a rolling 12 month list of renewals, focusing on the upcoming 2 quarters. This list is pulled from Zip and Coupa. The list should be reviewed and prioritized with the business owners. The renewal process should start at least 90 days ahead of the renewal date providing ample time to review the terms and decide:\nAre there any additional security requirements for the vendor?\nHas our sanctions screening tool, Risk Rate, detected any potential matches since the vendor was originally onboarded?\nHas the anticorruption risk profile changed?\nHas the vendor had an RFP for pricing in last 3 years?\nDo we want to terminate or reduce spend and need to proactively notify per the contract?\nDo we want to change any terms of our contract?\n6. Cancellation\nThe following methods will be used to capture cancellations (which include terminations and/or non-renewals):\nAutomated Notice:\nThe DRI for the purchased item will receive notification of an upcoming renewal;\nProcurement Led:\nThe Procurement Team will review upcoming renewals, and active purchases, during the quarterly ‚ÄúCategory Spotlight‚Äù meetings.\nDRI Led:\nDRI‚Äôs and other stakeholders may determine that products, events and/or services are no longer needed.\nFor each of the above, if a cancellation is desired (which include terminations and/or non-renewals) please follow the ‚ÄúCancellation Process‚Äù outlined below:\nSubmit a\nTermination/Non-Renewal Request\nthrough Zip by completing the intake form and providing copies of the existing contract(s) that you are canceling.\nThrough Zip, Procurement and Legal will work with the requester to provide instructions on how, when, and who should notify the vendor. For most non-renewal notices, the business owner will notify the vendor via Legal‚Äôs guidance.\nSecurity and Privacy will also be added for awareness and review if data is being shared with the vendor to determine the requirements of returning or deleting the data.\nFor certain cancellation requests, like Software for example, IT will be included in the Zip workflow to determine and complete the proper deprovisioning and system offboarding requirements. This includes\nremoval of the system\nfrom our\nTech Stack\n.\nIf necessary, the requester and/or business owner will need to create and execute on a communication plan to notify all or impacted team members of the cancellation.\nUpcoming terminations/non-renewals should be discussed with Procurement during the Quarterly Category Spotlight meetings that Procurement holds with category leads/budget owners. As Procurement is made aware of upcoming cancellations during these meetings, Procurement will review on a quarterly basis any known cancellations with Legal to ensure notification requirements are met. Procurement and Legal will then work with the business owner on completing the above process. If a cancellation is determined outside of this quarterly cadence, notify your Procurement Category Manager and complete the above process as soon as possible.\nThe Procurement Process\nAnytime a group of suppliers are being evaluated for services/goods or a purchase is being made on behalf of GitLab that does not qualify as a\npersonal expense\nor meet the list of\nexceptions\n, Procurement must be engaged BEFORE a purchase and/or work can begin. Start the Procurement Process\nBefore agreeing to any business, legal and/or pricing terms with a supplier, whether in conversation or email\nImmediately when you receive a contract and/or quote for new and/or recurring business\nIf you have received a contract from a supplier, tell them you will send to your procurement team for review\nWhen evaluating a group of suppliers and/or starting the\nRFP Process\n.\nIf unsure where or when to begin, tag the @procurement_team in the #procurement slack channel for support. You can also reach out to your\nProcurement Category Manager\ndirectly.\nHow to start the Procurement Process\nMajority of the Procurement Process lives within our Procurement system called Zip. You can access Zip via your\nOkta home page\n, or if you need Zip access,\nsubmit an access request here\n.\nFor more Zip training materials, review the\nZip End Users Guide\nand the\nTips for Submitting a Zip Request page\n.\nDepending on a few factors of your purchase, there are different ways to engage Procurement and start the Procurement process:\nSubmit a Zip Request for\nPurchase Requests for renewals of existing vendor‚Äôs services\nPurchase Requests for new spend\nunder $25k\nChange Requests to existing POs\n$0 contract reviews including demos and trials\nPartner Revenue Payments\nIndividual Use Software\nProviding Termination or Non-Renewal Notice\nFor new spend, changing vendors for existing services, or after 3 years of renewing a service, follow the\nRFP Process\nOver $250K: Procurement led RFP, typically 5+ vendor bids\n$100K - $250K: Business led RFP, 2-3 vendor bids required\n$25K - $100K: Business led quick-bid, 2 vendor bids required\nUnder $25K: no bid required\nHiring a Contingent Worker?\nIf you‚Äôre hiring a contingent worker, please read GitLab‚Äôs\nContingent Worker Policy\n, which provides comprehensive guidelines on engaging with different types of contingent workers. The policy outlines three main categories: Staff Augmentation Workers (agency-provided temporary resources), Consultancy Services (third-party professional services), and Independent Contractors (used by exception only). You‚Äôll find detailed information about each worker type‚Äôs characteristics, duration limits, country hiring guidelines, contractor extension processes, and background screening requirements. This policy is designed to help team members understand when and how to properly engage contingent workers while mitigating classification risks.\nNote: For subcontractors for the Professional Services team, please use the process for Revenue Partner Payments.\nReview Steps, Timeline, and Considerations\nRequests can take 5 days to 3+ weeks for processing depending on a number of factors that will impact the time for review of a Purchase Request including, but not limited to:\nNew or existing vendor\nIf negotiation is required\nTypes of data being shared with the vendor and if Security and Privacy need to review\nContract complexity and alignment with GitLab‚Äôs\nVendor Terms and Conditions\nVendor‚Äôs response time and willingness to negotiate\nEach review‚Äôs targeted approval time is outlined below, but as mentioned above, this is dependent on many factors and the accuracy and completeness of information provided by the requester. If your request meets any of the additional approval criterias outlined below, please plan accordingly and submit your Zip request allowing each cross-functional team enough time to complete their review. Please follow the\nsteps outlined for urgent requests\nthat cannot meet the below timeline and have specific and quantifiable impact to the business.\n1. Sanctions Screening (Ethics & Compliance): 30 minutes - 3+ Days, if required\nUse the vendor‚Äôs complete name in your Zip request, as this will be the basis for sanctions screening which automatically happens in our sanctions screening tool, Risk Rate. Incomplete names (e.g., ‚ÄúEY Germany‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúErnst and Young GmbH‚Äù) may result in false positives and unnecessary delay.\nIf Risk Rate detects no matches between the vendor and applicable sanctions lists AND the vendor is not located in a high-risk country, the vendor will be auto-approved. If Risk Rate detects a potential match or is located in a high risk country, the vendor may require escalation to and manual review by GitLab‚Äôs Trade Compliance Counsel.\nInclude the vendor‚Äôs website or LinkedIn page in the relevant Zip field, in advance, to help counsel evaluate the match more quickly.\n2.A. Buyer Review (Procurement): 2 days\nEnsure you have the appropriate contract documents uploaded when you submit your request\nThe $ amount of the req matches the contract value and the correct billing codes are selected\n2.B. New Supplier Onboarding: 2-3+ Days, if required\nThis is entirely dependent upon the suppliers response time.\nOnce supplier information has been submitted in Zip and the Procurement team sets the vendor up in Coupa, the supplier receives an email from Coupa requesting banking and tax information to facilitate payment.\nThe Procurement team cannot complete this on the supplier‚Äôs behalf since we do not know this information. If we did, it would be a violation of SOX Compliance guidelines.\nIf your supplier isn‚Äôt onboarded after 2 days, contact your supplier directly requesting they do so ASAP since their contract cannot be reviewed or approved until this is completed. Carbon copy\nprocurement@gitlab.com\n3.A. FP&A Review: 2 days\nFP&A is included as an initial reviewer to ensure the requested spend is within budget and that the Billing Code entered in Zip is correct so it can be pushed to Coupa when ready for final approvals.\n3.B. IT Review: 2 days if purchasing new software or for contractors\nRequester should have vendor complete the\nIT New Software Questionnaire\nand submit with the purchase request so IT can complete their review\n4.A. Legal Review: 3 to 21 days\nThe amount of time for review and reaching execution is based on the details below. Use these SLAs as guidelines, noting that each contract review is unique. If additional terms, requirements, and/or risks are identified, the timeline may be extended. The ability for GitLab to work efficiently through an agreement negotiation relies on the vendor and their counsel responding promptly to GitLab redlines and comments. Delays from the supplier will delay approval.\nTypes of Vendors and Review Times\nExisting vendors for renewals or upsells: 3-5 days\nExisting vendors generally require much less time as existing terms are in place which will underline the products and/or services being offered. That said, in the event GitLab is adding a new product and/or service, additional cycles may be required in order to amend the existing agreement.\n‚ö†Ô∏è You must either upload all complete contract terms (including attachments and amendments) or provide a direct link to an existing agreement. Indicate which sections cover your current request. For example, ‚ÄúSee existing Master Service Agreement with Vendor XYZ (Zip req #67890), Amendment #3 covers the new software modules we‚Äôre requesting‚Äù. Do\nnot\nprovide general references like ‚Äúcovered under existing agreement with vendor‚Äù or assume legal can locate terms without guidance.\nNew vendors: 1-3+ weeks\nNew vendors require the most amount of time as GitLab will be establishing terms and conditions for the first time, which will govern the use of the products and/or services being procured.\nAll contract documents must be provided in Word (.docx) format in English.\nPDF versions are not acceptable for legal review as they cannot be efficiently redlined. Contact the vendor to request the Word version before submitting your request.\nNegotiations can vary from 1 week to multiple months based on the level of detail and modifications required to reach executable terms.\nIf vendor doesn‚Äôt readily accept the\nGitLab standard terms\n, additional rounds of redlines and negotiations may be required, extending this SLA.\nWhenever possible, the legal team hopes to achieve redlines provided back to the vendor no less than five (5) business days after being assigned.\nTypes of Agreements\nSoftware (SaaS & On-Prem):\nRequires the most rigorous review to ensure the rights and obligations placed upon GitLab are, (i) reasonable given the software being provided, and (ii) align with GitLab contracting and industry standards.\nProfessional Services / Training:\nRequires detailed review to ensure intellectual property ownership aligns with our intentions, and reasonable obligations being placed upon GitLab.\nMarketing / Events:\nGenerally, requires the least amount of time to review as the obligations are standardized given the event in question and program provided. Details regarding events may include negotiations with regards to Force Majeure, cancellation (including penalty), and ensuring the terms align with those of the requesting GitLab team members.\nData Processing Agreement (DPA)/Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):\nRequired when personal data is shared with, accesssed, or collected by the supplier on behalf of GitLab. DPA/SCCs are generally affixed to an agreement but may be required as a separate agreement upon the determination of Privacy (see the Privacy review process below).\nNegotiation, Security, Privacy, and PeopleOps reviews are only required if the purchase request meets certain criteria, as described below. In the event two or more of these activities are required, they will happen in parallel to one another and Legal‚Äôs review.\n4.B. Negotiation: 12 days\nThe Procurement team negotiates SaaS contracts >$25k and one-time contracts >$100K\nIf this step is not taken, purchase orders will not be approved until Procurement is able to negotiate\nSLA can extend based on level of negotiation required for large and/or complex contracts, and the suppliers willingness to meet budget and benchmark indicators. For larger spend purchases, it is beneficial to engage Procurement prior to submitting the request in Zip so negotiations can start earlier.\nFor communicating Legal‚Äôs redlines to the vendor,\nIf the contract value is >$100k or Procurement is already actively negotiating or communicating with the vendor, Procurement will take responsibility for sending any legal redlines to the vendor. Procurement will comment in the req if/when they have sent redlines to the vendor for visibility. Otherwise the Stakeholder/Requester will be responsible.\nReview here for more details on when and who is responsible\n4.C. Security Review: 4-14 Days\nSecurity Third Party Risk Management\nreviews are required for vendors that collect, process, or store Orange / Red Data, software providers (SaaS and On-premise), and independent contractors / consultants. (Excluding field marketing events)\nThis activity cannot begin until\nafter\nthe supplier completes the security questionnaire and supplies their security documentation. Oftentimes, it can take 1-2 weeks for the supplier to respond and complete the requested materials. The security review SLA begins once that is completed. Time before this activity can begin is entirely dependent upon the supplier‚Äôs response time and maturity of security protocols.\nTo increase speed of approval, upload any security compliance documentation (SOC-2 Report, ISO27001 Certificate) to the ZipHQ Request and notify your supplier contact they will be receiving a request from GitLab‚Äôs Security Risk Team for completion ASAP.\nFor any inquiries and questions, please tag @securityrisk in the #procurement slack channel.\n4.D. Compliance Review: 4-14 Days\nThe first page of the Zip request includes anticorruption gating question (e.g., will the vendor interact with government agencies on our behalf, was this vendor recommended by a government official, etc.). If the answer to any of these questions is ‚Äúyes,‚Äù the Ethics & Compliance team must consider whether the vendor presents unacceptably high compliance risk.\nTo do this, the Ethics & Compliance team will conduct additional due diligence, which may, in part, consist of sending a questionnaire directly to the vendor. This questionnaire asks about the vendor‚Äôs ownership and history with applicable regulatory agencies, to better understand the risk, and asks whether the vendor has an anticorruption program in place, to understand whether the vendor has already taken measures to mitigate that risk. Turnaround time largely depends on the vendor‚Äôs responsiveness.\nWhen risk is present, the Ethics & Compliance team will consider whether anything can be done to mitigate that risk. Risk mitigation could, for example, consist of additional provisions in the vendor agreement.\n4.E. PeopleOps Review: 1-4 Days\nPeopleOps serve as reviewers on all professional services requisitions to determine if a background screening is necessary.\nPer GitLab‚Äôs\nPeople Policies\ncontractors are subject to complete a background screening. GitLab will accept a completed background screening from a contractor‚Äôs employer. However, if a background screening was never conducted GitLab will either complete one or ask that one be completed.\nA background screening can be requested by opening an issue in the\nLifecycle Management\nproject by using the\nbackground_check_request\ntemplate.\nApproval will occur once proof of a completed or an initiated background screening has been shared or once the contractor has submitted their background screening for processing.\nThe Sr. Background Check Specialist will only follow up if a result of concern returns on the background screening.\nQuestions and/or proof regarding background screenings on professional service requisitions in Zip can be sent to\nbackgroundchecks@gitlab.com\n.\n4.F. Privacy Review: 4-14 Days\nA Privacy Review is required for all SaaS purchases and other purchase types where the supplier will receive from GitLab or collect on GitLab‚Äôs behalf red/orange data. For existing vendors, a full privacy review is required every 24 months, provided the vendor completed a full and satisfactory privacy review during the prior procurement cycle\nThis activity begins\nafter\nthe supplier completes a Privacy and Trade Compliance Assessment form and a Transfer Impact Assessment Form (where personal data is transferred from the EU to the U.S.) Oftentimes, it can take a week for the supplier to respond and complete the requested forms. The SLA begins once that is completed.\nTime before this activity can begin is entirely dependent upon the supplier‚Äôs response time and whether a DPA/SCCs are required.\nA DPA/SCCs are often made part of the agreement with the supplier. Generally, Privacy would prefer to use our DPA/SCCs but if the supplier provides their DPA/SCCs as an exhibit to the main agreement, Legal and Privacy may use the supplier‚Äôs version to arrive at a final agreed upon version. Procurement will obtain executed versions of DPA/SCCs in the Final Buyer Review stage.\nTo increase speed of approval, add a link to the suppliers privacy notice; upload the suppliers Transfer Impact Assessment Guide; and upload a word version of their DPA/SCCs if the supplier requuests us to use their version.\n5. Final Buyer Review and Coupa Req Creation: 2 days\nProcurement completes a final check that all information is accurate and agreement(s) have been stamped before creating the req in Coupa for final approvals.\n6. Coupa Approvals and Execute Contract: 4 days\nAt this point, the req has been created in Coupa for final FP&A, Functional, and Executive approvals (as applicable).\nOnce these approvals are received, Procurement will route the contract for GitLab and vendor signatures and will comment in the Coupa req when it is routing. After both parties have signed the Agreement(s), Procurement will attach a copy of the executed agreement in Coupa, approve the Purchase Req, and release the PO.\nNote: only certain GitLab team members can sign contracts based on the\nAuthorization Matrix\nTo see how to check approval status in Coupa, visit the\nZip End Users Guide\n.\nNote: the completion of this step is dependent on how quickly the required approvers approve in Coupa and the contract is signed\n7. Finalize Request Details\nYour purchase req has been approved! The supplier will receive a copy of the PO and a communication from Coupa indicating how to submit invoices, one of two ways:\nDirectly in their Coupa portal (preffered)\nSending invoices to\nap@gitlab.com\nwith the PO number included on the invoice\nFailure to follow these instructions will delay payment and invoices uploaded to Coupa by a GitLab team member are not routed for payment.\nDuring this approval step, Procurement is finalizing any request details, such as final contract term dates based on signature effective date, and setting up Zip renewal alerts for the request if needed.\nSince the contract has been signed and PO is released at this point, you may now begin work and/or obtaining services from the supplier.\nWhat if I have an Urgent Request?\nIf you are unable to plan and have a legitimate reason to escalate a purchase request, follow the process below.\nPost in #procurement slack channel request for escalation with:\nLink to your Zip Request\nDate needed\nSpecific and quantifiable impact to the business if date is missed.\n‚ÄúSupplier wants it signed today‚Äù does not qualify as a reason for escalation and these requests will be denied.\n‚ÄúPrice will increase $45K if not signed by Friday‚Äù or ‚ÄúMaterial negative brand impact if not signed by Friday due to missed PR deadlines‚Äù are specific, tangible, business impacts that will be reviewed.\nTruly urgent and business critical requests will be evaluated, please note these are disruptive to our workflow and our ability to meet SLA‚Äôs for requests opened on time.\nWe may or may not be able to accommodate your urgent request based on the risk and bandwidth available.\nWhen you know you have a critical request with a deadline, enter the request into Zip 1-2 weeks prior to standard approval times to avoid needing escalation. Do this even if the contract isn‚Äôt final yet to help expedite the process.\nWhat are the exceptions to the PO Policy?\nExceptions to the PO Policy are:\nOne time purchases under $5K (or less than $5K annually)\nCharitable Contributions (Donations)\nInterview Candidate Reimbursement\nConfidential outside counsel legal fees\nStatutory Tax fees\nPEO Providers\nAR/Customer Refunds\nBoard of Director Payments\nFinancing, Banking and Investing (incl interest, debt, FX, fees)\nCorporate Credit Card\nUrgent Payments not included on list above (approval required from VP, Corporate Controller and/or PAO)\nThird Party Risk Management\nThe procurement team from a compliance and risk perspective has developed a process to handle third party risk to reduce the risk of the following:\nFinancial Fraud or exposure created by third party behavior such as:\nData leakage\nSecurity breach\nBusiness continuity\nEtc.\nFailure of financial viability of third party impacting delivery\nReputational damage arising from third party behavior\nBreach of regulation or law through third party action\nDisruption in customer service due to third parties\nWhen do we require a financial viability check?\nWhen any of the following is met:\nVendor is a private company, LLC or self-employed\nServices provided are required for continued operations\nCloud hosting services\nServices directly related to servicing customers with an uptime requirement\nStorage of data that is not recoverable if vendor goes out of business\nSoftware or services where it would take over 1 week to replace or swap\nHow do we ensure terms to establish GitLab (and our Vendors) rights and responsibilities?\nAny time GitLab engages with a third party for the procurement of goods and/or services, which require GitLab to engage in a contract, the GitLab Legal Procurement team will review the terms and conditions. The purpose of this team is to review the contract which GitLab will enter into, and ensure the following:\nTerms and conditions which are fair and reasonable given the type(s) of products and/or services being procured; and\nAdequate obligations on behalf of GitLab vendors to ensure compliance with\nGitLab‚Äôs Code of Conduct and other company policies,\napplicable laws, rules and regulations (including protection of personal data), and\nthe delivery, support and provision of goods and/or services\nIn addition to ensuring terms and conditions, the GitLab Legal Procurement team collaborates frequently with procurement and business stakeholders to ensure any (and all) contracts align with the needs of the team. The GitLab Legal Procurement team addresses the needs of stakeholders ranging from complex technical application and platform services, to creating and drafting event contracts to meet the needs of GitLab events.\nHow do we prevent disruption in customer service?\nAs GitLab does with its own customers, agreements with third parties include obligations that vendors have to GitLab. These can include, but are not limited to:\nUptime / downtime commitments (for SaaS providers)\nSLAs (for support)\nTermination rights\nAnd other commercial contract provisions which would enable GitLab to seek relief in the event of disruption\nLarge Internal Events Process\nFor any large internal events with a total cost greater than $1M, such as SKO, President‚Äôs Club, Commit, etc, the following should be completed before any contracts are executed or any work is conducted.\nThe planning stages for events of this size should be completed at least 18-24 months prior to the actual event. This allows for ample time to get the necessary internal approvals, run any RFPs needed, and book large hotel blocks or buyouts.\nConnect with your Procurement Category Manager and FP&A Business Partner to determine the various vendors needed to run the event and line item detail in the total event budget. This would include lodging, food & beverage, event planning, on-site support, excursions, travel, etc.\nDetermine with your Procurement contact how these vendors will be selected and the timeline to run any necessary\nRFPs\n. RFPs should be conducted at least 20 months prior to the event dates.\nUpon completion of RFPs, the top 2-3 location options and their total pricing will be presented to the E Group DRI (CRO/CMO) and VP of Finance to determine the preferred location choice and corresponding budget. All information should be summarized in an issue where these approvals may be documented.\nOnce preferred location and budget are tentatively chosen, this information will be presented to the CFO for approval, and will then be presented to the Board for approval at their quarterly meeting, or via email as necessary. Please note that Board approvals may take multiple weeks. CFO and Board approvals should be obtained no less than 18 months prior to the event dates.\nAfter all executive approvals are received, the Zip request(s) should be created to document official approvals, obtain signatures on contracts, and release PO(s).\nHelpful Documents and Templates\nContract Templates\nGitLab Vendor Terms and Conditions\nLogo Authorization Template\nData Processing Addendum (unlocked for editing)\nEU Standard Contractual Clauses\nUS Contractor Agreement\nSOW Template\nChange Request Template\nDocumentation\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Process\nCertificate of Insurance Request Process\nUploading Third Party Contracts to ContractWorks\nCompany Information\n- general information about each legal entity of the company\nTrademark\n- information regarding the usage of GitLab‚Äôs trademark\nAuthorization Matrix\n- the authority matrix for spending and binding the company and the process for signing legal documents\nOther Services\nHome Office and Supplies\nIndividual Use Software\nRFP and Vendor Selection Process\nVendor Terms and Conditions\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)\nCharitable Contributions\nNon-Cost Related Agreements (Including Trials/Demos)\nCharitable Contribution Requests\nIf you have a request to donate GitLab funds to a charitable cause, please refer to the Philanthropy ‚Ä¶\nContingent Worker Policy\n1.

You only need to look at the\nhandbook commits list\nto see the evidence. Every attempt is made to document guidelines and processes in the handbook. However, it is not possible to document every possible situation or scenario that could potentially occur. Just because something is not yet in the handbook does not mean that it is allowed. GitLab will review each team member‚Äôs concern or situation based on local laws to determine the best outcome and then update the handbook accordingly. If you have questions, please discuss with your manager or contact the\nPeople Success\nteam.\nHandbook Interpretation\nThe handbook is subject to interpretation. We do our best to be as clear as possible to minimize confusion and/or misinterpretation. We also recognize that we have a global audience and that may bring different interpretations. If you have any questions or need further clarification please check with the content owner of the page. When in doubt please reach out and ask.\nRemember that\neverything is in draft\nat GitLab and subject to change, this includes our handbook.\nCount handbook pages\nIt‚Äôs easy to see that the handbook is large, but have you ever wondered just\nhow\nlarge?\nThe handbook is over\ntwo\nthousand\npages long.

The AOP is a three statement (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Statement of Cash Flow), non-GAAP bottoms-up plan that spans the current fiscal year. The revenue is forecast off of the bookings plan and expenses are planned at the headcount and vendor level.\nPurpose\n: GitLab‚Äôs AOP identifies GitLab‚Äôs company goals for the next year and strategies for achieving them. Provide guidelines to understand how much capital is needed to achieve these goals.\nGovernance\n: The AOP is approved by the board of directors every year.\nAnnual Planning Steps\nAlign executive team on strategic priorities\nPrioritize efforts aligned with three year strategy and annual themes\nSign-off on financial priorities for the year\nBuild out bottoms up integrated sales and marketing financial model with key assumptions documented so they can be tracked\nSet targets agreed upon by Product, Marketing and Sales\nReview product investments vs expected revenue generation\nSet expected amount for annual compensation increases\nSet targets for any contributors on a company based performance plan\nProvide a budget envelope to each e-group leader based on dollars that they can allocate into headcount and program spend\nGenerate the expense Plan based on a headcount list, TBH list, vendor level spend list\nHeadcount list communicated to talent acquisition, proposed vendor list communicated to procurement (future with Purchase Orders in place for existing vendors)\nGenerate and document key assumptions\nShow trending of key metrics as output of the Plan\nCapture Plans to drive key metrics\nCapture X-functional dependencies of execution\nDocument business plans for key drivers and initiatives of the year, e.g. new products\nRevise and update the annual sales compensation plan\nSet annual quota assignments for revenue producing roles\nFY26 AOP Milestones\nKey planning milestones are listed below.

After the LRO is refreshed, there may be additional updates throughout the remainder of the year, on a quarterly and ad-hoc basis to determine whether near-term priorities and funding are needed in order to achieve long-term goals and financial targets.\nAs part of the quarterly and ad-hoc updates to LRO, the following are included:\nComparison to last LRO refresh across bookings, P&L, and cash flow\n6 quarter rolling forecast, including bookings, P&L, and cash flow\nComparison to peer benchmarking of similar revenue size for growth and efficiency metrics\nThe following are inputs in the LRO refresh and subsequent LRO updates:\nCapabilities and key investments across each business function (GTM, R&D, G&A), along with key cross-functional dependencies, risks/blockers\nGTM modeling: demand, productivity and supply capacity\nTotal rewards strategy\nExpense YoY and % of revenue targets, HC/non-HC spend by department\nBook to bill to cash collection assumptions\nSeasonality of bookings and expenses\nCash commissions\nPP&E/Capex purchases\nThe Corporate Finance team leads the LRO refresh and updates in collaboration with: e-group members to determine key investments, capabilities, and dependencies; GTM Finance team for sales productivity/capacity models, CTB, and bookings attainment; G&A Finance team for total rewards strategy, benefit assumptions; and the R&D Finance team to help inform on allocations, hosting/infrastructure expenses.\nBusiness Planning\nBusiness Planning Goal\nFor GitLab‚Äôs top growth drivers and new products, drive and document alignment between contributors to success. Writing a business plan drives clarity of thought and operations. Agree on governance models to manage initiative success and cross-functional accountability. At a minimum, each business plan should cover:\nExplain what an initiative is, why we should be focused on it.\nIdentify how each function will support its success, what are dependencies & risks.\nIdentify how we measure success, e.g. pipeline or bookings goals.\nBusiness Planning Details\nProduct plan\n- what are product features to ship, by when? What is committed and what is at risk? What are competitive considerations? If there are phases, what is in scope for each phase?\nPricing plan\n- what is the pricing strategy, what are open decisions, what is the margin structure?\nMarketing plan\n- how will product marketing and demand generation support the business plan.\nSales plan\n- what are the drivers of the sales plan? What is the quarterly Plan for  bookings? What are assumed attach rates, penetration rates, adoption rates, where is there uncertainty? What is the field enablement plan?\nServices plan\n- if applicable, how can enhanced services improve sales and adoption?\nOperational plan\n- what infrastructure do we need (fulfillment, IT, rev rec, legal, security, etc.)\nFinancial plan\n- gross margin and contribution to P&L, if applicable\nKey Contributors\nDriver: FP&A\nContributors\nProduct: lead PM(s), pricing lead\nMarketing: leads within both Product Marketing and Demand Gen\nSales: Regional VPs, RS&A, GTM FP&A\nSupport/Services\nAs needed: fulfillment, IT, accounting, legal, security\nApprovers / Informed:\nCFO, CRO, CMO, CPO, e-group\nReview and Governance\nContributors (above) agree on business plan and review with e-group members for feedback. Include proposed measurement plan (e.g. bookings or pipeline goals)\nOn a defined cadence (monthly or other), review product accomplishments vs. plan\nOn a defined cadence (monthly or other), review GTM measures of success vs. plan\nOn a defined cadence (quarterly or other), review P&L impact vs. plan\nEach quarter, refine success goals/metrics based on learnings to iterate on plan of record\nQuarterly & Monthly Cycle (incl. close, variance, forecast, guidance)\nGitLab‚Äôs FP&A team participates in a rigorous monthly close process.\nGoals\nSet clear deadlines to best support our accounting team and ensure timely delivery of information to executives\nAnalyze the performance of our budgets and forecasts against actuals, identify insights which enable our executives to better make decisions.\nUpdate our internal forecasts and update our investor guidance to prepare for the quarterly earnings call\nImprove forecasting methodologies and approaches to hold ourselves accountable and drive accountability to the business owners of the budget\nKey Definitions\nActuals\nWhat\n: Actuals are results that have been reported or exist in a system that is designated as a single source of truth for the item that is being measured. Each month accounting closes the month and financial results are recorded in our ERP system and are published in our financial statements. These actuals are compared to the Plan and our forecasts.\nForecast at\nFYyyyy-mm\nPurpose\n: In a dynamic high-growth business, GitLab‚Äôs needs may change through the year and we need to be able to predict what is going to happen.\nWhat\n: Forecast is a dynamic assessment based on current expectations of financial performance. The FP&A team will publish a monthly forecast for revenue driven by bookings and other key inputs and expenses driven by headcount and vendor spend. A monthly forecast does not extend the forecast period. For example in March 2020, the forecast will span from February 2020 to January 2021 with February actuals and a forecast for the period March 2020 to January 2021 ‚Äî this will be called the (1+11) forecast.\nGovernance\n: The Forecast at\nFYyyyy-mm\nis approved by the Head of FP&A and reviewed with the CFO.\nNote: Prior to locking and archiving any version in Adaptive, Corporate FP&A will update the FX rates in Adaptive using\nGoogle Finance FX Rates\n.\nForecast at\nFYyy-Qx\nPurpose\n: In a dynamic high-growth business, GitLab‚Äôs needs may change through the year and we need a guidepost to hold business leaders accountable. We plan our expenses at a high level (e-group) and we expect this group to make prioritizations and trade-offs while remaining accountable against the plan parameters. By formally reforecasting quarterly, we can quickly evaluate and incorporate new initiatives into our forecasting model. That being said, we do follow an annual plan to set our goals and measurement for our top-level targets of revenue, profitability and expense management and ensure we continue to  meet any public guidance previously communicated\nWhat\n: Forecast at\nFYyy-Qx\nis a dynamic assessment based on current expectations of financial performance. The (3+9), (6+6), and (9+3) quarterly forecasts include revenue driven by bookings and other key inputs and expenses driven by headcount and vendors.\nGovernance\n: The quarterly forecast is approved by the Head of FP&A and reviewed with the CFO. It is then reviewed with e-group and the board of directors. e-group will be held accountable to the quarterly forecast for expenses.\nForecast Snapshots in Months 2-3 of each Fiscal Quarter\nPurpose\n: As a public company, GitLab needs to maintain a pulse on the P&L and key financial metrics. As a fiscal quarter develops, the snapshots inform the CFO and e-Group of our latest forecast and any adjustments from the previous snapshot view.\nCadence\n:\nIn Month 1 of the quarter\n: once in week 2 (the week before FP&A‚Äôs Month 1 forecast version lock)\nIn Month 2 of the quarter\n: weekly starting week 2 (the week before FP&A‚Äôs Month 2 forecast version lock)\nIn Month 3 of the quarter\n: weekly\nWhat\n: P&L snapshots track company metrics against Wall Street expectations related to revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share and enable GitLab to make in-quarter spending decisions based on the latest estimates from FP&A. The forecast snapshots are developed by FP&A and presented to the CFO in order to facilitate decision-making. The P&L snapshot follows the\nFinance Business Partners / Talent Acquisition Managers Headcount Forecast Interlock process\nand is delivered to the CFO via a slide deck tracking week over week changes in the snapshot. A summary is also communicated to the CFO and FP&A team via the #fpa_private Slack channel.\nMonthly FP&A Close Timeline\nThese dates are based on an 8-day accounting close. Corporate FP&A will confirm the close date with the accounting team and update the FP&A Close calendar in Google accordingly. For FY23, the target is to close by WD 5 with full consolidation (including tax entries, eliminations) by WD 10.\nClose timeline\nWD -3: AP Closed.\nWD -2: All accruals and JEs are due from FP&A\nWD -2: NetSuite Actuals for current month close included in Adaptive (performed by Corporate FP&A)\nWD 1: Headcount actuals loaded into Adaptive (performed by Corporate FP&A)\nWD 2: FP&A Flux distributed and is due one week after and/or one day after Accounting close\nWD 2: FP&A sends flash to the board (quarter only) - Bookings, revenue estimate and NGOI estimate\nWD 5: Revenue Closed.

The goal of this meeting is to do a comprehensive review so that finance leadership has a pulse on the business and signs off on the financials. Based on insights from variance analysis, the FP&A team makes actionable recommendations to the CFO and e-group to ensure continued performance to Plan/Forecast.\nThe variance analysis will compare department budgets with actual results and examine any material differences between budgeted and actual costs. Additionally, the actuals for expenses will be compared to the quarterly rolling forecast. The expenses are reviewed at the divisional department level, allowing GitLab to measure progress in meeting its Plan or rolling forecast. The team also evaluates the accuracy of forecasts and will make adjustments to the next rolling forecast.\nVariance and Flux Analysis\nThe study of differences between actuals and the Plan or Forecast. During the variance analysis processes the GitLab FP&A team analyzes and isolates any variance in question to the lowest level possible. The team reviews detailed items in order to identify the root cause of the variance. This could include transaction date, cost center, vendor, location, department or additional low level details.\nThe FP&A team takes the following into consideration while evaluating variances in relation to materiality thresholds:\nThe percentage size of the variance (i.e. what was the overall variance by percentage)\nThe correlation to other variance (i.e. did a immaterial difference in one place cause a material difference in another)\nThe inherent character of the variance (i.e. does the expense correlate to the traits of the business)\nThe FP&A team delivers an FP&A expense flux review document at each monthly close, documenting and quantifying business drivers for variance. The goal is two-fold:\nControl\n: ensure accuracy of actuals. Analysts should aim for 90% coverage in explanations, e.g. if variance is $100, aim to list drivers for net $80 of the variance for any particular intersection above threshold. List drivers in descending order of impact, followed by large offsetting drivers.\nInsights\n: leverage insights gained from closed month to inform rolling forecast. Changes in business strategy/model, new accounting policies, and refinements on forecast methodology should be documented and incorporated into the new forecast.\nPerformance Indicator\n: Variance percentage\nWe measure our team performance based on our forecast accuracy, also known as variance percentage. Variance percentage is defined as the difference between actuals and Plan or rolling forecast. We calculate it as follows:\nVariance Percentage (Plan) = (Actuals - Plan)/Plan or\nVariance Percentage (Forecast) = (Actuals - Rolling Forecast)/Rolling Forecast\nVariance analysis should address any inputs or additional requests from the last\nVariance meeting\n, as applicable.\nTypes of Threshold and Materiality\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) does not provide definitive guidance in distinguishing material information from immaterial information. Therefore, GitLab uses a percentage based approach for defining materiality thresholds and can be found below. The Plan vs Actuals vs Forecast Sisense dashboard provides the data for the threshold analysis via a color coded legend.\nOur goal is to have revenue and EBIT variance percentage within +/- 2% on a quarterly basis.\nKey accounts and expenses by division should be within +/- 2% versus Plan or rolling quarterly forecast every quarter.\nVariance Meeting with EVPs\nEVPs are held accountable to meet the budget in dollars that they are given. The budgets typically are broken into headcount and program spend. Each finance business partner will run a meeting with their Finance leader and the EVP to review the past month. The information should be presented as timely as possible. Given the accounting close is 8 days, the team is asked to use pre-close numbers for the review to increase the speed of information. During the meeting, the Finance Business Partners will review GitLab results in addition to a detailed overview. Each division can expect to review the following during the monthly meetings:\nCompany results\nSpending OpEx vs Plan\nDivisional level review including an executive summary with relevant insights and watchpoints\nLast month vs plan/rolling forecast\nProjection for the current quarter\nDetailed variance details that helps the EVP understand the financial picture of their expenses\nDiscuss upcoming changes to financial processes that EVPs need to be aware of\nDiscuss upcoming changes to help Finance Business Partner update the rolling forecast\nDiscuss any budget lines that underspent and if money can be reallocated before quarter-end. Noting that converting program dollars to headcount is usually difficult as it impacts future periods.\nAt quarter end, review the upcoming  quarter vs Plan for the Division and for each department on the quarter\nFollowing the month-end close, the Finance Business Partners will create a variance deck and distribute department income statements to the related budget owners and the e-group members. Each department is then responsible for comparing these reports, which contain actual costs, to the budget. Departments, with guidance from the Finance Business Partners, should analyze their data and if necessary, discuss items of interest and take appropriate action. Any questions regarding the cost data should be discussed with the Finance Business Partner.\nQuarterly FP&A Close Timeline\nThe close timeline for each quarter follows the timeline above for monthly close and includes additional key dates and processes:\nGuidance\nOverview\n: We provide quarterly guidance on key metrics of the business. At the earnings call for the previously concluded quarter, we provide guidance for the following quarter and the full fiscal year. For example, at the Q1-FY23 earnings, we will provide guidance for Q2-FY23 and updated FY23 guidance. We report guidance based on dollar ranges (except for weighted average shares outstanding which is given as a share estimate).\nWe provide quarterly guidance on the following metrics:\nRevenue\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (NGOI)\nNon-GAAP Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP EPS, or NGEPS)\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding (WASO)\nCadence\n: Following accounting close, the Corp team provides guidance proposals to the Head of FP&A for review. Following that review and any necessary iteration, the Corp team meets with the CFO and the Head of Investor Relations to review the guidance proposal, iterate, and finalize guidance figures.\nDeliverable\n: The deliverable to the CFO and the Head of Investor Relations is a slide deck with the proposed guidance range, implied guidance for the following quarters, comparable company benchmarking, and sensitivity analyses. The guidance proposed is also included in the Audit Committee and Board of Director deck materials.\nQuarterly Earnings Process\nAs a public company we share financial results publicly after the close of each fiscal quarter or fiscal year. The purpose, timeline, and deliverables can be found on our Investor Relations page\nhere\n.\nHeadcount Forecast and Hiring Plan\nDefinitions\nSingle Source of Truth (SSOT) Headcount Forecast and Hiring Plan\nFinancial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) team is the owner of SSOT for GitLab‚Äôs\nHiring Plan\nwhich contributes to our Headcount Forecast.\nHeadcount Forecast is a live forecast in Workday Adaptive (a financial planning software)\nHeadcount Forecast includes all approved positions in AOP (i.e. Active, Planned and Backfill positions)\nHiring Plan is subset of Headcount Forecast (i.e.Planned and Backfill positions only)\nHiring Plan is maintained by the Finance Business Partners (FBPs) and shared with Talent Acquisition (TA) team and Business Partners (BPs)\nFinance owns the Hiring Plan to ensure there is only one Headcount Forecast and Hiring Plan for the business\nHiring Plan increases our predictability as a company and streamlines the hiring process\nBased on historical time to start data, new requisitions released via RLOA in a quarter can be expected to start in the following quarter at the earliest\nFor questions specific to TA‚Äôs process and REQ creation, please refer to\nTA‚Äôs section of the handbook\nPosition ID (PID)\nPosition ID is a unique identifier and is the link between approved headcount and the Hiring Plan\nEach position is approved and allows TA to open a role for the business\nPositions are all approved headcount in the Hiring Plan.\nAll approved headcount includes Active, Planned and Backfill positions\nOnly Planned and Backfill positions are included in the Hiring Plan\nAll positions in the Hiring Plan are approved through:\nAnnual Operating Plan (AOP) cycle (beginning of each fiscal year)\nRLoA\ncycle for any incremental roles through the year\nBackfill due to attrition in the business\nPositions may be updated/changed during weekly interlock process (e.g. reallocated to different team, changed for different Role level)\nEach position is assigned with an unique identifier called Position ID (PID)\nPID increases visibility and accuracy for headcount forecasting (count and dollars)\nPID simplifies and provides transparency on modeled headcount (attrition and backfill)\nPID is an unique identifier for positions assigned to all current and future approved headcount\nPIDs are created and assigned by Corporate FP&A (Corporate) when Hiring Plan is finalized or upon change request of existing position(s)\nAll approved Planned and Backfill positions are assigned with an GHPID (please refer to\nTA‚Äôs section on GHPID\n)\nNot all positions are assigned with GHPIDs\nKey difference between GHPID and PID\nGHPID has 1-to-1 relationship with an Opening ID in Greenhouse (please refer to\nTA section on Opening\n)\nPID has 1-to-1 relationship with an approval headcount\nEach PID has 1-to-1 relationship with a GHPID at any given time\nIllustrative example:\nEmployee\ndeparts and business decides to backfill the same role\nDeparting employee A will have\nPID: FIN-FY24-9999 (tied to Headcount Forecast)\nGHPID: GH-FY23-999-0001 (issued to hire Employee A\nin the past\n)\nTo open the new requisition, we will need\nStarting from FY25 AOP cycle, GHPIDs will be generated through a consolidated process\nAll GHPIDs are system-generated by a FP&A internal Google Sheet, maintained and audited by Corporate\nEach Planned and Backfill position will have a unique GHPID assigned by FBP(s)\nGHPID will allow TA to open a requisition in Greenhouse.\nIf an approved role is not assigned with a GHPID, the job will not be opened in Greenhouse\nFinance Business Partners (FBPs) work with Business Partners (BPs) to discuss details of each approved headcount and enter final decisions of each position to Adaptive as SSOT Hiring Plan\nDetails of the position include, but are not limited to, Department, Job Title, Job Grade, Salary, Location\nFBP include all PIDs (assigned by Corporate) for approved Planned and Backfill positions in Hiring Plan\nFBP include all GHPIDs for roles eligible to be opened in Greenhouse\nAdding/removing/exchanging position(s) requires FP&A‚Äôs approval through existing RLOA or rolling forecast.

If the role is a future role and has been deleted, but was never input into Greenhouse, the FBP can use that number for its replacement or a different role since it was not used yet.\nMaintaining Hiring Plan\nFP&A team is the owner and maintainer of SSOT for GitLab‚Äôs Hiring Plan\nObjective of this control is to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of Hiring Plan\nCompleteness\n: all approved positions are assigned with PIDs and GHPIDs\nAccuracy\n: no PID and GHPID is assigned to duplicated or deprecated positions\nConsistency\n: ensure Hiring Plan in Adaptive is fully reconciled to details in Live Interlock Google Sheet and details in Greenhouse requisition\nPIDs and GHPIDs are stored in Workday Adaptive (Adaptive) and are required fields in Hiring Plan\nFBPs will update Hiring Plan weekly in Adaptive & update TA through weekly Interlock.\nFBPs may update their Headcount Forecast on a more frequent basis (more than weekly) depending on their individual department‚Äôs business needs\nUpdating Hiring Plan could require adding new roles, deleting roles, trading off roles, or adding backfills\nHiring Plan audit and reconciliation is performed by Corporate, including\nWeekly GHPID audit and reconciliation through TA and FP&A Interlock\nMonthly PID audit and reconciliation through monthly forecast lock\nCorporate will reach out to FBPs if noticing any discrepancies and resolve them before monthly forecast lock\nFinance Business Partners / Talent Acquisition Managers Forecast Interlock\nPurpose\nThe FP&A team and Talent Acquisition Managers collaborate to ensure understanding and implementation of the most up-to-date view of forecasted headcount-related expenses. This interlock enables GitLab to respond quickly and make live decisions through a weekly P&L forecast and the\nrolling list of asks (RLOA) process\n. This process also ensures alignment and accuracy of headcount forecasts when FP&A locks its annual plan and monthly rolling forecasts. This process also tracks company metrics against Wall Street expectations related to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Please see the\nHeadcount Metrics and Processes page\nfor definitions and key metrics.\nHeadcount Live Dashboards\nThe Hiring Plan data is divided into four headcount forecast templates, one for each cost center with Cost of Goods Sold allocated among Sales and R&D. The data and analysis from the four templates roll into the Summary file. The four templates can be found in the\nHeadcount Live Summary Dashboard\n.\nCadence / Process\nUnless otherwise noted in the HC Forecast calendar or communicated via Slack, the interlock process occurs weekly as follows:\nBy noon (PST) Monday\n, the Corp FP&A team downloads the data from Adaptive and refreshes the headcount forecast templates. Talent Acquisition also refreshes the headcount forecast templates with the latest data from Greenhouse.\nBy end of day (PST) Wednesday\n, the Talent Acquisition Managers and Recruiters review their respective roles line by line and make adjustments and comments related to expected start dates and other role details provided by the Finance Business Partners. If no indication is made for a specific role in the headcount forecast template, Talent Acquisition signals that the current indication is reasonable and indicative of a 50/50 ‚Äúmost-realistic‚Äù forecast. The Talent Acquisition Managers also pay close attention to any recruiting capacity restraints within any given quarter. In order to maximize transparency and understanding of any changes, the Talent Acquisition Managers and Recruiters provide comments (e.g., wrong GHP ID, rejection of an offer, delay due to business decision, etc.) for specific roles.\nBy end of day (PST) Thursday\n, the Finance Business Partners update Adaptive with their best estimates of the start dates of all planned personnel for the forecast period based on the input from Talent Acquisition in the headcount forecast templates. This reflects a 50/50 ‚Äúmost realistic‚Äù view of headcount expenses/timing.\nBy end of day (PST) Friday\n, the Corp FP&A team sends a P&L snapshot to the CFO incorporating any headcount forecast adjustments. Note: P&L snapshots are not provided during accounting close.\nCommunication\nCommunication related to the interlock takes place in the #fpa-ta_headcount_forecast Slack channel. All parties involved in the interlock are also granted access to the ‚ÄúHC Forecast‚Äù Google Calendar.\nDeliverables\nThe Finance Business Partners and Talent Acquisition Managers collaborate to provide the most current and 50/50 ‚Äúmost-realistic‚Äù view of headcount-related expenses. This is done through the interlock process in the headcount forecast template and is ultimately uploaded into the Planned Personnel sheet in Adaptive.\nThe inputs loaded into Adaptive are then used to provide the CFO a weekly P&L snapshot in order to facilitate in-quarter spending decisions and ensure the company tracks vs.  guidance and consensus expectations.\nExpense Controls\nThe primary mechanism to ensure efficient spend of company assets is the\nProcure to Pay\nprocess, and specifically completion of the\nvendor and contract approval workflow\nprior to authorization. The procurement team or your finance business partner can assist with questions related to this process.\nThe second mechanism is the budget vs actual review to determine reasons for variances vs plan. See the section on\nVariance Meeting with CFO\nand\nVariance Analysis\n.\nAdaptive Planning\nA manual on how to update and maintain Adaptive integration can be found\nhere\n. This document is maintained by the Corporate FP&A team.\nAdaptive Quarterly Roadmap\nThe current Adaptive roadmap can be found\nhere\nWe expect to transition roadmap and requests into GitLab issues by Q2-FY23.\nCorporate FP&A will host Adaptive intake sessions with the larger FP&A team to intake, align and prioritize current and future projects.\nRolling List of Asks (RLOA)\nIntent of RLOA Process\nReinvest back into the business when company expects to beat expectations\nEnable e-group and leaders to make informed and fast business decisions\nCreate a repeatable and transparent quarterly process into incremental investments\nExpectations for Business Partners\nYour FP&A partner will assist in maintaining a rolling list of asks (RLOA).

This initiative quickly gained traction and saw over 100,000 meals being donated across 19 countries. 2021‚Äôs campaign expanded to include any type of donation, including donations of time as part of Global Volunteer Month.\nUpstream Diversity Working Group\nHaving identified a talent gap in both the technology and the university system which speaks predominantly to Underrepresented Groups, the\nUpstream Diversity Working Group\nwas established.\nGeared toward knowledge sharing, the 2022 piloted program saw GitLab team members extending their technical skills and time to those in Underrepresented Groups (URGs) with a view to creating\nfuture career opportunities\nfor them within the technology sector.  The program mobilised GitLab team members to serve as\ncoaches\nin partnership with\nLatinitas\n;\nFreeCodeCamp\nand\nre:Learn\n.\nTrusted Interns\nAs a pioneer in the\nall-remote\nspace, GitLab is uniquely leveraged to prepare youth around the globe for the\nfuture of work\n.

Let‚Äôs analyze that sentence a bit.\nAnyone: Every person in the world should be able to afford great DevSecOps software. GitLab.com has free private repos and CI runners and GitLab CE is\nfree as in speech and as in beer\n. But open source is more than a license, that is why we are\na good steward of GitLab CE\nand keep both GitLab CE and EE open to inspection, modifications, enhancements, and suggestions.\nCreate: It is a\nsingle application\nbased on\nconvention over configuration\n.\nProposal: With Git, if you can read it, you can fork it to create a proposal.\nAt any time: You can work concurrently with other people, without having to wait for permission or approval from others.\nWithout setup: You can make something without installing or configuring for hours with our web IDE and Auto DevSecOps.\nWith confidence: Reduce the risk of a flawed proposal with review apps, CI/CD, code quality, security scans, performance testing, and monitoring.\nEveryone can contribute to and co-create with GitLab, the application\nWe actively welcome contributors to\nenable everyone to contribute to and co-create with GitLab, the application\n. When\neveryone can contribute and co-create\n, users become contributors and we greatly\nincrease the rate of innovation to benefit customers and users. There is also an open dialogue between GitLab and our customers, partners, and the community so that we can also better identify what they need. That way we can not only build a solution for them, but bring that solution to the world.\nWe think that it is logical that our collaboration tools are a collaborative\nwork themselves. More than\n3,000 people from the wider community\nhave contributed to GitLab to make that a reality.\nWe do this by having quality code, tests, documentation, popular frameworks,\nand offering a comprehensive\nGitLab Development Kit\nand a dedicated\nGitLab Design System\n.\nWe use GitLab at GitLab Inc., we\ndogfood\nit and make it a tool we continue to love. We celebrate contributions by\nrecognizing a Most Valuable Person (MVP) every month.\nWe allow everyone to anticipate, propose, discuss, and contribute features by having everything on\na public issue tracker. We ship a new version every month so contributions\nand feedback are visible fast. To contribute to open source software, people\nmust be empowered to learn programming.\nThat is why we sponsor initiatives such as Rails Girls.\nThere are a few significant, but often overlooked, nuances of the\nenabling everyone to contribute to GitLab, the application\nmantra:\nWhile collaboration is a core value of GitLab, over collaborating tends to involve team members unnecessarily, leading to consensus-based decision making, and ultimately slowing the pace of improvement in the GitLab application. Consider\ndoing it yourself\n, creating a merge request, and facilitating a discussion on the solution.\nFor valuable features in line with our product philosophy, that do not yet exist within the application, don‚Äôt worry about UX having a world class design before shipping. While we must be good stewards of maintaining a quality product, we also believe in rapid iteration to add polish and depth after an\nis created.\nPrefer creating merge requests ahead of issues in order to suggest a tangible change to facilitate collaboration, driving conversation to the recommended implementation.\nContributors should feel free to create what they need in GitLab. If quality engineering requires charting features, for example, which would normally be implemented out of another team, they should feel empowered to prioritize their own time to focus on this aspect of the application.\nGitLab maintainers, developers, and Product Managers should be viewed as coaches for contributions, independent of source. While there are contributions that may not get merged as-is (such as copy/paste of EE code into the CE code base or features that aren‚Äôt aligned with product philosophy), the goal is to coach contributors to contribute in ways that are cohesive to the rest of the application.\nA group discussion reiterating the importance of everyone being able to contribute:\nEveryone can contribute to GitLab, the company\nTo\nenable everyone to contribute to GitLab, the company\nwe have open business processes.\nThis allows all team members to suggest improvements to our handbook. We hire remotely so our team members can be judged on results, not presence in an office. We engage on social media platforms and in our blog post comments. And we strive to take decisions guided by\nour values\n.\nEveryone can contribute to about.gitlab.com\nWe welcome all contributors in the\nwww-gitlab-com project\nso that\neveryone can contribute to about.gitlab.com\n. GitLab uses about.gitlab.com to share our expertise with the world and believe we can build even greater levels of trust with contributions from our team and community. We strive to provide a great experience for our existing and new community members by reviewing changes and integrating the contributions into our regularly planned updates.\nCadence and Alignment\nOur Mission is on a 30 year\ncadence\n.\nPurpose\nOur purpose\nis to help people\nincrease their lifetime earnings\nthrough training, access to opportunities, and the DevSecOps platform.\nOur mission is the way we realize\nour purpose\n. By\nenabling everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world\n, we increase access for people to be creators. With more contributors and more creators, we increase both the volume and velocity of innovation.

The\nProduct Principles\nsection is where you can learn about our strategy and philosophy regarding product development, here we discuss the processes we use tactically.\nProduct Development Flow\nIntroducing changes requires a number of steps, with some overlap, that should be completed in order. GitLab follows a dual-track\nproduct development flow\nspanning product, engineering, UX, and quality. We\nuse GitLab to power product development flow\n. When changes are released, we follow the\nrelease post process\nto communicate externally about new capabilities.\nThis process should be both up front and on an on-going basis when building features.\nThe Importance of Direction\nDocumenting a Section, Stage, Group and Category direction is critical to communicating where we are heading and why to all of our stakeholders. We document our direction in direction pages. Read more about related processes under\nPlanning and Direction\n.\nUnderstanding Milestones and Releases\nInterpreting release dates\nclarifies how product teams use milestones and labels to indicate the likelihood of feature delivery within certain time frames.\nThe\nrelease definitions\nare maintained by the Engineering Team and we run the end of each Milestone on the\nrelease date\n.\nRelevant links\nEngineering release definitions\nFeature flag lifecycle\nProduct Launch process\nCommunication\nProduct Org Communication Touchpoints\nIn November 2024 we adjusted our communicated touch points based on feedback from our\nFY25-Q2 Engagement Survey\n, AMAs, skip levels, and 1:1s. The two key areas we are prioritizing:\nEmbedding more asynchronous touchpoints to reach team members across time zones\nImplementing additional opportunities to cascade information from E-Group and PLT\nSynchronous Product Org Communication Touch Points\nProduct All-Team Meeting: We have a quarterly synchronous meeting for the Product Org. As of Nov 2024, we are expanding on the existing content and structure to ensure key strategic updates from each PLT department head are effectively cascading through the organization regularly.\nProduct Key Review: We follow the company wide key-review format which covers key updates to the product division and is shared with cross-functional stakeholders.\nAsynchronous Product Org Communication Touch Points\nCPO Fortnightly Update: David posts a slack message in #product-private every two weeks. This is a way for him to share what is top of mind for E-group and across the product team.\nNew Hire Intros: New hires to the product org are encouraged to post their introduction in the #new-team-members slack channel. Once per month, a member of our Product Leadership Team will post a consolidated list of new hires and their intros into the #product-private slack channel.\nMonthly Showcase: On a 4-week cadence we have an async monthly showcase, facilitated in the #product-private channel, where people can share what they‚Äôre working on with the rest of the Product Org. This is a low-key competition with prizes to incentivize folks to contribute videos. Team members can add videos throughout the month, then the entire Product Org can vote on their favorite video via google form. At the end of the 4-week period, there will be a prize for the winner, announced in David‚Äôs fortnightly update. In the case of a tie in number of views, David will make the final call on who wins. We hope that this encourages team members to share their wins and exciting developments in their feature areas! Note: We‚Äôre doing this on a 4-week cadence (rather than calendar month) so that it aligns with David‚Äôs fortnightly updates, which are posted every other week. This should still be roughly aligned to the calendar month.\nOther Communication Channels\nProduct Function Issue Tracker\n- please use\nconfidential issues for topics that should only be visible to team members at GitLab.\nProduct Function GitLab Group - @gl-product\nProduct Management GitLab Group - @gl-product-pm\n[\nChat channel - #product-private\n]. This is a private slack channel for members of the product-org; new team members are automatically added to this channel as part of onboarding.\nChat channel - #product\n. All GitLab internal team members can use the\n#product\nchannel for any product-related questions but you‚Äôll also find more direct assistance in the various\nProduct Group\nchannels.\nCommunicating with the Entire Product Management Function At Once\nWhen communicating change or a request for action to the entire product function, utilize the following levels and corresponding activities.\nLevel\nDescription\nActivities\nOne\nSuggestion for review from interested PMs and FYI\nPost MR/issue in\n#product\nTwo\nRequest for action from all PMs\nPost in\n#product\nand mention\n@gl-product-pm\nin MR/issue with specific action instructions.\nThree\nConfirmation of understanding\nPost in\n#product\nand mention\n@gl-product-pm\n; checkbox for each\n@gl-product-pm\nmember in an MR/issue description to confirm; assign MR/issue to all\n@gl-product-pm\nmembers\nInternal and external evangelization\nBefore shipping a new or updated feature, you are responsible for championing\nit, both internally and externally. When something is released, the\nfollowing teams need to be aware of it as they will all need to do something\nabout it:\nMarketing: depending on the importance of the feature, we need the help of\nmarketing to promote this feature on our different communication channels.\nSales: sales needs to know what‚Äôs new or changed in the product so they can\nhave better arguments to convince new or existing customers during their sales\nprocess.\nSupport: as they are in constant contact with our users and customers,\nsupport should know exactly how our products work.\nYou can promote your work in several ways:\nstart with documenting what will be released and share this documentation with\nthe different teams\nschedule meetings, if you think it‚Äôs important, with the teams listed above.\nWhen referencing issues in written communication using just the issue number\n#123456\nand a link is not\nlow-context communication\n. Instead use the title of the issue and the link or the issue number and description of the problem that issue will solve:\nGood:\nWe will next be working on [Detect and display code coverage reports on MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21549)\nWe will next be working on [gitlab#21549](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21549) which will help developers view code coverage reports directly in GitLab instead of losing context by looking in another tool while reviewing an MR\n.\nAvoid:\nWe will next be working on #21549.\n.\nIn order to support\nfindability\nand to clearly\narticulate when we change our minds\nespecially when it comes to product direction, category changes, shifts in investment themes, or priorities for engineering, Product Managers must evangelize these changes in multi-modal communication channels to ensure our users and customers aware.\nSome\ninternal\nmethods for communication include:\nSharing the updates various product-based Slack channels such as:\n#product\n,\n#s_\n,\n#g_\n, or\n#f_\nSlack channels\nCross-posting changes in direction or categories into #customer-success and if they impact\nuse cases\ntag\n@cs-leadership\nfor awareness\nRecording a quick video and sharing with Customer Success that discusses direction updates. Use sync meetings\nas needed\nto facilitate efficient communication.\nCollaborate with the Field Communications team\nto determine if a larger internal communications plan/approach is necessary for the Field (Sales, Customer Success, Channel & Alliances) team.\nAggregating and sharing highlights of monthly direction page updates at the Section-level across the organization\nExternal\nchannels for consideration linking direction pages to:\nTwitter, LinkedIn, or other social accounts\nSharing outreach emails via account teams\nRecording walkthroughs on Unfiltered and promoting on social accounts\nWriting a blog about the changes, if they are significant or disruptive\nWriting to inspire action\nAs a PM, it is important to remember a\nbias towards action\n(and other value actions like\nsense of urgency\n,\nmake a proposal\n,\nboring solutions\n,\nwrite things down\n,\ndon‚Äôt wait\n, and\nmake two way doors decisions\nwhich enables PMs to drive an async discussion to being action oriented. Every time you write a comment or create an issue ask yourself: Will this allow us to take an action and move us forward?\nWriting about features\nAs PMs we need to constantly write about the features and upgrades we ship: in a blog post,\ninternally to promote something, and in emails sent to customers. There are some\nguidelines that one should take into account when writing about features,\nthe most important being a clear communication of the problem we‚Äôre solving for users.\nWhen writing about a feature, make sure to cover\nthese messaging guidelines\nwhich help produce clear internal and external\nmessaging. Please also keep in mind that we should avoid using acronyms that others my not recognize, such as ‚ÄúMVC‚Äù for Minimal Valuable Change. For more guidance you can visit our\nwriting style guidelines\n.\nLet‚Äôs highlight the messaging guidelines mentioned above with a concrete example, Preventing Secrets in your repositories,\nthat\nwe shipped in 8.12\n.\nStart with the context. Explain what the current situation is without the\nfeature. Describe the pain points and connect back to our\nValue Drivers\n(in this case\nReduce Security and Compliance Risk\n).\nIt‚Äôs a bad idea to commit secrets (such as keys and certificates) to your\nrepositories: they‚Äôll be cloned to the machines of anyone that has access to the\nrepository. If just a single one is insecure, the information will be\ncompromised. Unfortunately, it can happen quite easily. You write\ngit commit -am 'quickfix' && git push\nand suddenly you‚Äôve committed files that\nwere meant to stay local!\nExplain what we‚Äôve shipped to fix this problem.\nGitLab now has a new push rule that will prevent commits with secrets from entering the repository.\nDescribe how to use the feature in simple terms.\nJust check the checkbox in the repository settings, under push rules and\nGitLab will prevent common unsafe files such as .pem and .key from being committed.\nPoint to the documentation and any other relevant links (previous posts, etc).\nHere are some additional examples of well written release blog posts for inspiration:\nIssue Board Work In Progress Limits\nParent-Child Pipelines\nDrag-and-drop Design badges\nRender charts in GitLab issues using a Grafana URL\nRecording videos to showcase features\nIn addition to the written medium, video is an important medium that caters to the different goals you are trying to accomplish and learning styles of your audience.\nDepending on the type of video you are recording, there are some guidelines to keep in mind.\nAs our documentation guidelines\nactively encourage\nlinking video content,\nplease consider following the\nDocumentation Style Guide section on language\n,\nand working with your technical writing team to include links to your speed runs, walk-throughs and demos at relevant locations in the product documentation.\nUsing GIFs\nAnimated GIFs are an awesome way of showing of features that need a little more than just an image, either for marketing purposes or explaining a feature in more detail. Checkout our guide to\nMaking Gifs\n!\nSpeed Run\nSpeed runs are informal videos meant to focus on a single workflow and the experience for performing that workflow. It should not require much planning and is typically short in duration (less than 5 min.). This video type is meant to inform and not necessarily to influence buyers.\nExamples:\nGitLab Unfiltered Speed Runs Playlist\nRemove docker images via CI/CD speed run\nDemo\nDemos are scripted recordings meant to influence buyers. Generally has higher production value and typically involves both a slide-style presentation and/or live screen-sharing. Duration varies depending on the topics being covered.\nExamples:\nGitLab for the Enterprise Demo\nWalk-through\nProduct walk-throughs are informal videos meant primarily for an internal audience as a recorded, visual form of product critique. Walk-throughs typically focus on the user experience across categories and workflows within a Product Manager‚Äôs\nproduct scope\n. There are particular benefits to walk-throughs which span\nproduct hierarchy\nboundaries (multi-category, multi-stage, multi-section) as they help highlight disjointed experiences across our single-application.\nWalk-throughs are typically longer in length as they cover more ground and often involve some ‚Äúlive‚Äù troubleshooting and are best performed with no planning. Use the\nProduct walk-through issue template\nwhen creating a walk-through.\nExamples:\nAuto DevOps setup and usage walk-through\nQA Release Candidates on staging and elsewhere\nAfter the feature freeze, it‚Äôs expected of each product manager to test their own features and perform quality assurance\nto the best of their ability and follow up where necessary.\nProduct managers can use the staging environment once the release managers have deployed a release candidate (RC) to staging.\nRelease managers should post in the\n#product\nchannel in Slack that a new release candidate is available. Product managers\ncan also use other environments as needed, such as GitLab provisioned on Kubernetes with GKE.\nFeature assurance\nBefore a new feature is shipped, the PM should test it out to make sure it\nsolves the original problem effectively. This is not about quality assurance\n(QA), as developers are responsible for the quality of their code. This is about\nfeature assurance (FA). FA is necessary because sometimes there are\nmisunderstandings between the original issue proposal and the final\nimplementation. Sometimes features don‚Äôt actually solve the intended problem,\neven though it seemed like it would, and sometimes solutions just don‚Äôt feel as\nuseful as intended when actually implemented.\nIf you can test out the feature during development, pulling down branches\nlocally (or with a review app!), that‚Äôs great. But sometimes it‚Äôs not feasible\nto test a feature until it‚Äôs bundled into a release candidate and deployed to\nGitLab.com. If so, make sure to test out features as soon as possible so any new\nissues can be addressed before final release. Also, take the FA cycle into\naccount when scheduling new milestone work.\nIf you are looking to test code that has not been merged to GitLab.com or is not yet\npart of an RC, you can pull the branch down locally and test it using the\nGitLab\nDevelopment Kit (GDK).\nDealing with security issues\nQuality Engineering Managers (QEM) are the DRIs for prioritizing bugs. These include security issues which are prioritized in conjunction with the security team. Product Managers must work with their QEM to set Milestones for issues marked with the\nbug::vulnerability\ntype label\nto guarantee they are shipped by their due date, as defined in the\nSecurity Team process\n.\nWhile Product Managers are the DRIs for\nmilestone planning\n, they must respect the prioritization order for bugs and maintenance issues as determined by their QEM and EM, respectively. As such they should deeply understand the implications and risks of security-related issues and balance those when prioritizing a milestone work. Addressing a serious security issue by its due date may require temporarily adjusting the desired work type ratio for one or more milestones. Priority labels and Due Date designations for security issues should never be modified by Product Managers as they are directly managed by the Security Team and used to track metrics and progress.\nFoundational Requirements\nWhen thinking about new features, we must not only think about the functional requirements of a feature (defining what the feature will do), but also to think about foundational requirements (defining how the feature works). At the highest level, foundational requirements define items such as performance, scalability, compatibility, maintainability and usability characteristics of a feature. It is important to have foundational requirements in place up front, as this is much easier than trying to add them later and change expectations, or break existing workflows. Our\ndefinition of done\ncontains specific areas of consideration that are required for the acceptance of new contributions.\nFor an in depth review of foundational requirements (often referred to as non-functional requirements), see\nthis resource\n.\nTo deliver features, we must have both functional and foundational requirements defined.\nIntroducing application limits\nTo enhance availability and performance of GitLab, configurable limits should be put in place for features which utilize storage, or scale in a manner which could impact performance. For example, we\nlimit the number of webhooks per project\n, and we allow admins to set\nrate limits on raw endpoints\n. These limits ensure more consistent performance, reduce the likelihood of outages, and offer admins tools to limit abuse or enforce specific standards. While these limits can be configurable, sensible default limits should be defined for our GitLab SaaS and GitLab dedicated offerings.\nThere is a guide about\ndeveloping application limits\nin the GitLab Docs.\nWhen implementing application limits\nSee\nRate Limiting::Managing Limits\n.\nManaging data lifecycle and growth\nAs we continue to scale our product, we need to consider the amount of data being stored for new features. Data storage is not an infinite resource, so we should think carefully about what data needs persistent storage to provide the desired user experience. We also need to consider the cost implications around data storage. Everything we store impacts our bottom line, and we should therefore be careful to ensure we are only storing necessary data for well thought out time-frames. We are working on\ndefining a sustainable data retention policy\n, and will iterate on this section as more general guidelines are developed.\nData storage comes in three main forms for GitLab ‚Äì object storage, database storage, and Git repository storage. While we have dedicated teams devoted to ensuring we can scale these storages appropriately, it is in our best interest to only store what is required for a feature to perform as intended. Additionally, there are situations where storage should be subject to data retention policies.\nConsiderations around data storage\nWhen evaluating feature data storage, the following data storage topics should be considered.\nWhat quantity data needs to be stored?\n- What amount of data will need to be stored for the feature to function as intended. Is this level of data storage bounded, or is there a potential for unbounded growth? Unbounded growth should be avoided if possible.\nHow long should data be retained?\n- We should consider carefully the need to store data indefinitely. For many features, removing certain data after a specified time period won‚Äôt impact the functionality of the feature. In these instances, we should put retention policies in place. These retention polices should have a sane default value which is considered best practice for operating the feature long term.\nNote: it is easier to iterate toward longer data retention time frames, but far harder to reduce retention time frames. Consider starting out with a conservative time frame.\nHow often will this data be accessed?\n- Much like the quantity of data stored can lead to scalability issues, so can the increased load on the data stores when the data is accessed frequently. There are ways to ease the burden on our infrastructure by properly forming queries, caching often used data, or carefully considering how repository data is accessed. If there are questions, consider reaching out to the\nDatabase Group\nor the\nGit Group\nfor assistance.\nA good example where we‚Äôve successfully evaluated data storage is our CI/CD Artifacts. We‚Äôve set some sane default values for both\nmaximum artifact size\nand for\ndefault artifacts expiration\n, while making these both configurable for administrative users.\nCross-stage features\nSee\nthis page\nfor details on working across stages at GitLab.\nStages, Groups, and Categories\nStages, groups, and categories\nserve as a common framework for organizing and communicating the scope of GitLab.\nHow to work as a PM\nIf you follow the principles and workflow above, you won‚Äôt be writing long, detailed\nspecs for a part of the product for next year. So how should you be\nspending your time?\nInvest the majority of your time (say 70%) in deeply understanding the problem.\nThen spend 10% of your time writing the spec\nfor the first iteration only\nand\nhandling comments, and use the remaining 20% to work on promoting it.\nA problem you understand well should always have a (seemingly) simple or obvious\nsolution. Reduce it to its simplest form (see above) and only ship that.\nPrioritization\nSee the\nCross-Functional Prioritization page\nfor more information.\nPrioritization Framework\nPriority\nDescription\nIssue label(s)\n1*\nSecurity\nbug::vulnerability\n2*\nData Loss\ndata loss\n3*\nResilience, Reliability,\nAvailability\n,\nand Performance\navailability\n,\ninfradev\n,\nCorrective Action\n,\nbug::performance\n4\nOKR‚Äôs\n5\nUsability\nUsability benchmark\n,\nSUS::Impacting\n,\nDeferred UX\n6\nInstrumentation\ninstrumentation\n7\nxMAU / ARR Drivers\ndirection\n8\nAll other items not covered above\n*indicates forced prioritization items with SLAs/SLOs\nForced Prioritization\nAny of the items with a ‚Äú*‚Äù are considered issues driven by the attached\nSLO or SLA\nand are expected to be delivered within our stated policy. There are two items that fall into Forced Prioritization:\nSecurity Issues labeled with\nbug::vulnerability\nmust be delivered according to the stated\nIssues supporting our product‚Äôs scale which include\nbug::availability\nwith\nspecific SLOs\nas well as\ninfradev\n,\nCorrective Action\n,\nci-decomposition::phase*\nthat follow the stated\ntype::bug\nAny issues outside of these labels are to be prioritized using\ncross-functional prioritization\n. Auto-scheduling issues based on automation or triage policies are not forced prioritization. These issues can be renegotiated for milestone delivery and reassigned by the DRI.\nEngineering Allocation\nWhile we have moved to the\ncross-functional prioritization process\nto empower teams to determine the optimal balance of all types of issues, we will keep Engineering Allocations as a way to allow teams to quickly shift to a critical priority, designating the EM as the DRI to drive the effort.\nEngineering is the DRI for mid/long term team efficiency, performance, security (incident response and anti-abuse capabilities), availability, and scalability. The expertise to proactively identify and iterate on these is squarely in the Engineering team. Whereas Product can support in performance issues as identified from customers. In some ways these efforts can be viewed as risk-mitigation or revenue protection. They also have the characteristic of being larger than one group at the stage level. Development would like to conduct an experiment to focus on initiatives that should help the organization scale appropriately in the long term.  We are treating these as a percent investment of time associated with a stage or category. The percent of investment time can be viewed as a prioritization budget outside normal Product/Development assignments.\nEngineering Allocation is also used in short-term situations in conjunction and in support of maintaining acceptable Error Budgets for GitLab.com and our\nGitLab-hosted first\ntheme.\nUnless it is listed in this table, the Engineering Allocation for a stage/group is 0% and we are following normal\nprioritization\n. Refer to this\npage\nfor Engineering Allocation charting efforts. Some stage/groups may be allocated at a high percentage or 100%, typically indicating a situation where all available effort is to be focused on Reliability related (top 5 priorities from\nprioritization table\n) work.\nDuring an Engineering Allocation, the EM is responsible for recognizing the problem, creating a satisfactory goal with clear success criteria, developing a plan, executing on a plan and reporting status.  It is recommended that the EM collaborate with PMs in all phases of this effort as we want PMs to feel ownership for these challenges.  This could include considering adding more/less allocation, setting the goals to be more aspirational, reviewing metrics/results, etc.   We welcome strong partnerships in this area because we are one team even when allocations are need to resolving issues critical to our business.\nDuring periods of Engineering Allocation, the PM remains the interface between the group and the fields teams & customers. This is important because:\nIt allows Engineering to remain focused on the work at hand\nIt maintains continuity for the field teams - they should not have to figure out different patterns of communication for the customer\nIt keeps PMs fully informed about the product‚Äôs readiness\nGroup/Stage\nDescription of Goal\nJustification\nMaximum % of headcount budget\nPeople\nSupporting information\nEMs / DRI\nPMs\nBroadcasting and communication of Engineering Allocation direction\nEach allocation has a\ndirection page\nmaintained by the Engineering Manager. The Engineering Manager will provide regular updates to the direction page. Steps to add a direction page are:\nOpen an MR to the\ndirection content\nAdd a directory under the correct stage named for the title Engineering Allocation\nAdd a file for the page named\nindex.html.md\nin the newly created directory\nTo see an example for an Engineering Allocation Direction page, see\nContinuous Integration Scaling\n. Once the Engineering Allocation is complete, delete the direction page.\nHow to get a effort added to Engineering Allocation\nOne of the most frequent questions we get as part of this experiment is ‚ÄúHow does a problem get put on the Engineering Allocation list?‚Äù.  The short answer is someone makes a suggestion and we add it.  Much like everyone can contribute, we would like the feedback loop for improvement and long terms goals to be robust.  So everyone should feel the empowerment to suggest an item at any time.\nTo help with getting items that on the list for consideration, we will be performing a survey periodically.  The survey will consist of the following questions:\nIf you were given a % of engineering development per release to work on something, what would it be?\nHow would you justify it?  Have you tried leveraging\ncross-functional prioritization process\nbefore considering an engineering allocation?\nWe will keep the list of questions short to solicit the most input.  The survey will go out to members of the Development, Quality, Security.  After we get the results, we will consider items for potential adding as an Engineering Allocation.\nClosing out Engineering Allocation items\nOnce the item‚Äôs success criteria are achieved, the Engineering Manager should consult with counterparts to review whether the improvements are sustainable. Where appropriate, we should consider adding monitoring and alerting to any areas of concern that will allow us to make proactive prioritizations in future should the need arise. The Engineering Manager should close all related epics/issues, reset the allocation in the above table to the floor level, and inform the Product Manager when the allocated capacity will be available to return their focus to product prioritizations.\nWhen reseting a groups Engineering Allocation in the table above, the goal should be set as\nfloor %\n, the goal should be\nempower every SWEs from raising reliability and security issues\n, percentage of headcount allocated should be\n10%\n, and\nin place of a link to the Epic.\nAll engineering allocation closures should be reviewed and approved by the\nVP of Development\n.\nFeature Change Locks\nA Feature Change Lock (FCL) is a process to improve the reliability and availability of GitLab.com. We will enact an FCL anytime there is an S1 or public-facing (status page) S2 incident on GitLab.com (including the License App, CustomersDot, and Versions) determined to be caused by an engineering department change. The\nteam\ninvolved should be determined by the author, their line manager, and that manager‚Äôs other direct reports.\nIf the incident meets the above criteria, then the manager of the team is responsible for:\nForm the group of engineers working under the FCL. By default, it will be the whole team, but it could be a reduced group if there is not enough work for everyone.\nPlan and execute the FCL.\nInform their manager (e.g. Senior Manager / Director) that the team will focus efforts towards an FCL.\nProvides updates at the\nSaaS Availability Weekly Standup\n.\nIf the team believes there does not need to be an FCL, approval must be obtained from either the VP of Infrastructure or VP of Development.\nDirect reports involved in an active\nborrow\nshould be included if they were involved in the authorship or review of the change.\nThe purpose is to foster a sense of ownership and accountability amongst our teams, but this should not challenge our no-blame culture.\nTimeline\nRough guidance on timeline is provided here to set expectations and urgency for an FCL.  We want to balance moving urgently with doing thoughtful important work to improve reliability.  Note that as times shift we can adjust accordingly.   The DRI of an FCL should pull in the timeline where possible.\nThe following bulleted list provides a suggested timeline starting from incident to completion of the FCL.  ‚ÄúBusiness day x‚Äù in this case refers to the x business day after the incident.\nDay 0: Incident:\nBusiness day 1:  relevant Engineering Director collaborates with VP of Development and/or VP of Infrastructure or their designee to establish if FCL is required.\nBusiness day 2:  confirmation that an FCL is required for this incident and start planning.\nBusiness days 3-4:  planning time\nBusiness days 5-9 (1 week):  complete planned work\nBusiness days 10-11:  closing ceremony, retrospective and report back to standup\nActivities\nDuring the FCL, the team(s) exclusive focus is around\nreliability work\n, and any feature type of work in-flight has to be paused or re-assigned. Maintainer duties can still be done during this period and should keep other teams moving forward. Explicitly higher priority work such as security and data loss prevention should continue as well. The team(s) must:\nCreate a public slack channel called\n#fcl-incident-[number]\n, with members\nThe Team‚Äôs Manager\nThe Author and their teammates\nThe Product Manager, the stage‚Äôs Product leader, and the section‚Äôs Product leader\nAll reviewer(s)\nAll maintainers(s)\nInfrastructure Stable counterpart\nThe chain-of-command from the manager to the VP (Sr Manager, Sr/Director, VP, etc)\nCreate an\nFCL issue\nin the\nFCL Project\nwith the information below in the description:\nName the issue:\n[Group Name] FCL for Incident ####\nLinks to the incident, original change, and slack channel\nFCL Timeline\nList of work items\nComplete the written Incident Review documentation within the Incident Issue as the first priority after the incident is resolved.  The Incident Review must include completing all fields in the Incident Review section of the incident issue (see\nincident issue template\n).  The incident issue should serve as the single source of truth for this information, unless a linked confidential issue is required. Completing it should create a common understanding of the problem space and set a shared direction for the work that needs to be completed.\nSee that not only all procedures were followed but also how improvements to procedures could have prevented it\nA work plan referencing all the Issues, Epics, and/or involved MRs must be created and used to identify the scope of work for the FCL. The work plan itself should be an Issue or Epic.\nDaily - add an update comment in your FCL issue or epic using the template:\nExec-level summary\nTarget End Date\nHighlights/lowlights\nAdd an agenda item in the\nSaaS Availability weekly standup\nand summarize status each week that the FCL remains open.\nHold a synchronous\nclosing ceremony\nupon completing the FCL to review the retrospectives and celebrate the learnings.\nAll FCL stakeholders and participants shall attend or participate async.  Managers of the groups participating in the FCL, including Sr. EMs and Directors should be invited.\nAgenda includes reviewing FCL retrospective notes and sharing learnings about improving code change quality and reducing risk of availability.\nOutcome includes\nhandbook\nand\nGitLab Docs\nupdates where applicable.\nScope of work during FCL\nAfter the Incident Review is completed, the team(s) focus is on preventing similar problems from recurring and improving detection. This should include, but is not limited to:\nAddress immediate corrective actions to prevent incident reoccurrence in the short term\nIntroduce changes to reduce incident detection time (improve collected metrics, service level monitoring, which users are impacted)\nIntroduce changes to reduce mitigation time (improve rollout process through feature flags, and clean rollbacks)\nEnsure that the incident is reproducible in environments outside of production (Detect issues in staging, increase end-to-end integration test coverage)\nImprove development test coverage to detect problems (Harden unit testing, make it simpler to detect problems during reviews)\nCreate issues with general process improvements or asks for other teams\nExamples of this work include, but are not limited to:\nFixing items from the Incident Review which are identified as causal or contributing to the incident.\nImproving observability\nImproving unit test coverage\nAdding integration tests\nImproving service level monitoring\nImproving symmetry of pre-production environments\nImproving the\nGitLab Performance Tool\nAdding mock data to tests or environments\nMaking process improvements\nPopulating their backlog with further reliability work\nSecurity work\nImprove communication and workflows with other teams or counterparts\nAny work for the specific team kicked off during this period must be completed, even if it takes longer than the duration of the FCL. Any work directly related to the incident should be kicked off and completed even if the FCL is over. Work paused due to the FCL should be the priority to resume after the FCL is over. Items created for other teams or on a global level don‚Äôt affect the end of the FCL.\nA stable counterpart from Infrastructure will be available to review and consult on the work plan for Development Department FCLs. Infrastructure FCLs will be evaluated by an Infrastructure Director.\nPlease also note the corresponding\nEngineering handbook section\nabout the relative importance and prioritization of availability, security, and feature velocity. To ensure we‚Äôre providing an appropriate focus on security, data loss, and availability, PMs should consider:\ntracking the appropriate labels for each prioritization category\n: Use a standing item to discuss these issues with an engineering manager and ensure you understand the impact of related issues in your area before planning a release.\noptimizing for quality once a merge request is ready for review\n: This means ensuring that Engineering has sufficient time to meet our\ndefinition of done\n- including a\nhigh-quality code review\n- without cutting corners to get something into production.\nPrioritization sessions\nTo help PMs plan, stage group stable counterparts can participate in prioritization sessions. They serve mainly as an\ninternal sensing mechanism\nfor PMs to make more informed prioritization decisions for different planning horizons. Usually, teams focus on the\nproduct releases\nhorizon, but can also focus on the\nFY themes\nor\nstrategy\nhorizons. This group exercise also boosts team morale, improves communication and empathy, and broadens individual‚Äôs perspectives. Besides, it can be a more informal and joyful way of connecting the team and discussing work.\nThe output of these sessions is a\npriority matrix\nthat shows the relative priority of a set of items based on two weighted criteria. Generally, the criteria are\nimportance\nand\nfeasibility\n, each one visualized as an axis of the matrix. You can change the criteria depending on the planning horizon or goals. To better understand how the sessions work, see an example\nmural\nand\nsession recording\n.\nAlways consider\nasynchronous sessions\nfirst, in an effort to be more inclusive and respectful of others time. That said, if possible, synchronous sessions can be ideal, as they allow limiting the time spent and make great use of the activities‚Äô momentum for a more efficient discussion and voting.\nUse our\nMural template for prioritization sessions\n, built for product releases but adaptable for other planning horizons or criteria.\nProcess template\nAdapt this process as needed, and consider changing it to an asynchronous mode of communication. For example, participants can review the items async, add questions as\ncomments in Mural\n, and vote using\ndot voting\nor in\nvoting sessions\nheld on different days for each criterion.\nBefore:\nThe facilitator creates a mural from our\ntemplate for prioritization sessions\n, with the stage group and milestone in its name.\nThe facilitator invites the stage group counterparts for a 50-minute call, scheduled sometime before the team finalizes the release scope (see the\nproduct development timeline\n). Includes the URL of the mural and planning issue in the event description.\nThe facilitator shares the preparation work with the participants, preferably in the group‚Äôs planning issue (see the template after this list and an\nexample\n.\nParticipants do the preparation work (see the template after this list).\nDuring (see an\nexample session recording\n):\nThe facilitator starts\nrecording the call\n.\nPresent\n: For each participant, the facilitator\nsets the timer\nfor 10 minutes (adapt per the no. of participants). A participant then presents their issues, preferably using the\nRICE framework\n. Only after the participant presents all issues should other attendees ask questions. Once in a while, the facilitator announces how much time remains. When the timer goes off, repeat this for another participant.\nVote\n: After all participants have presented, the facilitator\nruns two voting sessions\n: first for\nimportance\n, and then for\nfeasibility\n. Each participant has 5 votes (adapt per the no. of issues). The facilitator sets the timer for 2 minutes, repeating for each voting session.\nVisualize\n:\nReview your voting session results\nand everyone helps place the stickies on the matrix, depending on their number of votes for each criterion.\nIf there‚Äôs still time, discuss the most-voted issues as a group.\nAfter:\nThe facilitator\nuploads the recording to GitLab Unfiltered\n, sets its visibility (see\nSAFE framework\n), adds to relevant playlists, and includes the URL of the mural and planning issue in the description.\nThe facilitator shares the recording URL and voting results in the planning issue, preferably with a screenshot of the matrix and links to the highest voted issues (see an\nexample\n.\nPreparation work template\n## :map: Prioritization session\n`@-mention participants`\nfor our [\nprioritization session\n](\n/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization-sessions\n), here's the [\n**Mural**\n](\n) for us to add the issues we want to see in\n. I scheduled our 50-minute session for\n.\n1.\nAdd your issues to the Mural before the call. Let's try to limit to\n**5 issues per person**\n, so it's easier to vote on them and keep things focused. You can find instructions on how to add them in the \"Outline\" panel on the right side of the Mural UI.\n1.\nTry not to add Security or Availability issues. This is also noted in the [\nproduct processes page\n](\n/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization\n), as those issues have forced prioritization with SLAs/SLOs.\n1.\nIf you can, mark issues that appeared in previous sessions by changing their sticky color to\n**orange**\n.\nThanks and see you soon :bow:\nUsing the RICE Framework\nis a useful framework for prioritization that can help you stack rank your issues. The RICE framework is a great tool for prioritizing many issues that seem to be of equal value at first glance. In order to drive clarity and alignment in the prioritization of work across the entire DevOps platform, and to help prioritize items that may compete for resources from different teams, we have set a standard for the RICE factors so all prioritization decisions based on RICE are using the same metric.\nReach\nHow many customers will benefit in the first quarter after launch? Data sources to estimate this might include qualitative customer interviews, customer requests through\nSupport/CS/Sales\n, upvotes on issues, surveys, etc.\nHigher reach means a higher RICE score:\n10.0 = Impacts the vast majority (~80% or greater) of our users, prospects, or customers\n6.0 = Impacts a large percentage (~50% to ~80%) of the above\n3.0 = Significant reach (~25% to ~50%)\n1.5 = Small reach (~5% to ~25%)\n0.5 = Minimal reach (Less than ~5%)\nImpact\nHow much will this impact customers and GitLab? Impact could take the form of increased revenue, decreased risk, and/or decreased cost (for both customers and GitLab). This makes it possible to compare revenue generating opportunities vs. non-revenue generating opportunities. Potential for future impact should also be taken into account as well as the impact to the GitLab brand (for example unlocking free-to-paid conversion opportunities).\nHigher impact means a higher RICE score:\nMassive = 3x\nHigh = 2x\nMedium = 1x\nLow = 0.5x\nMinimal = 0.25x\nConfidence\nHow well do we understand the customer problem? How well do we understand the solution and implementation details? Higher confidence means a higher RICE score.\nHigh = 100%\nMedium = 80%\nLow = 50%\nEffort\nHow many person months do we estimate this will take to build? Lower effort means a higher RICE score.\nCalculating RICE Score\nThese four factors can then be used to calculate a RICE score via the formula:\n(Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort = RICE\nHere is an example RICE calculation you can use to help prioritize work in your area. Feel free to embed this at the Epic level to provide context for why you did or did not prioritize.\nRICE Factor\nEstimated Value\nReach\n10.0\nImpact\n.5\nConfidence\n80%\nEffort\n2 month\n‚Äî‚Äî\nScore\n(10.0 x .5 x .80) / 2 =\n2.0\nOther important considerations:\nIs this in support of a company or team\n?\nDoes it bring our\nvision\ncloser to reality?\nDoes it help make our community safer through\nmoderation tools\n?\nDoes it meaningfully improve the user experience of an important workflow?\nIs it something we need ourselves?\nIs it particularly\nimportant to customers\n?\nThe technical complexity is acceptable. We want to preserve our ability to make\nchanges quickly in the future so we try to avoid complex code, complex data structures, and optional settings.\nIt is orthogonal to other features (prevents overlap with current and future features).\nThe requirements are clear.\nIt can be achieved within the scheduled milestone. Larger issues should be split up, so that individual steps can be achieved within a single milestone.\nRefer to\nresearch participant gratuities\nsection to understand\nif your study qualifies for incentive distribution\n.\nWe schedule a prioritized issue by assigning it a milestone; for more on this see\nPlanning a Future Release.\nAsync RICE Exercise\nConducting a RICE prioritization exercise with your cross-functional counterparts is a powerful way to make the process more inclusive and improve the quality of your rankings. Consider making this an async-first process to accommodate team members across different timezones. For an example of how to do this async-first, see\nthis issue that the Geo team used to collaborate on a RICE prioritization exercise.\nThis\nblank async RICE template\nis also available for you to copy for your own async prioritization exercise.\nIssues important to customers\nFor prioritizing most issues, we should utilize the RICE framework noted\nabove\n, which will capture an aggregate of customer demand. You can also augment RICE scores with the\nCustomer Issues Prioritization Framework Dashboards\n:\nCustomer Requested Issues (Product)\nfor product managers\nCustomer Requested Issues (CSM)\nfor  Sales, CS and CSM\nThese dashboards provide several inputs for calculating RICE and aggregate all customer requested issues and epics into a single dashboard. These dashboards are not meant as a replacement or sole input for\nTop ARR Drivers for Sales/CS\n. Further requirements such as the\nintegration of themes\nneed to be implemented before this framework can be used to fully inform or replace tools such as the\nTop ARR tracker\n.\nIn some cases however, we may become aware of a feature which is particularly important to deliver on by a certain date. Examples of this could include an issue necessary to embark on a new GitLab rollout, a feature needed by a partner to launch an integration, or a method to import data from a service which is being discontinued. In these instances, the responsible PM can apply the\ncustomer\nor\ncustomer+\nlabel along with a\ndue date\nand initial\nmilestone\n. This set of labels can serve to indicate externally that the issue is particularly important, as well as a reminder for internal teams of its importance.\nIt is important to note that the\ncustomer\nand/or\ncustomer+\nlabel does not constitute a promise for the issue to be delivered in any given milestone or time frame.\nCommunity Considerations\nGitLab is open-source, encouraging and promoting a large ecosystem of contributors is critical to our success. When making prioritization decisions,\nit‚Äôs important to heavily weight activities which will encourage a stronger community of contributors. Some of those activities are:\nThe creation of small primitives that can be utilized and iterated on by community members\nThe building of integration points which can entice independent third parties to contribute an integration\nThe addition of tools or features which make the contribution experience easier\nProduct managers are not responsible for prioritizing contributions outside of their group. These contributions should be\nreviewed and merged swiftly\nallowing everyone\nto contribute, including non-product teams at GitLab.\nSaaS-First Framework\nThe\nSaaS-First product investment theme\nwill put us in a better position to support our customer base who is expected to accelerate adoption of SaaS products in the coming years. Features will also end up more secure, resilient, performant, and scalable for our self-managed customers if initially built to the expectations of SaaS. Therefore, it is important for PMs to understand and prioritize needs related to the SaaS business. When prioritizing SaaS related issues, we follow the same\nguidelines above\n. Within those guidelines there are a few areas that are especially important for PMs to focus on to ensure the success of our SaaS users.\nAvailability\nDowntime of GitLab.com has a material impact on our customers. From a 2014 report\nGartner estimates\nthat downtime costs companies on average ‚Äú$5,600 per minute, which extrapolates to well over $300K per hour.‚Äù Furthermore, SaaS downtime can severely disrupt the productivity of GitLab Inc since we rely heavily on GitLab.com to run our business. Finally, downtime can also lead to customer churn and damage to our reputation. Thus, it is crucial as a company we collectively work towards consistently maintaining our\n99.95% SLA on GitLab.com\n. There are a few things that PMs can do in partnership with their engineering team to help ensure overall Availability for GitLab.com.\nMake sure each new feature that gets built has full end-to-end test coverage.\nBefore rolling out a new service to support a major new feature launch, ensure that your team has gone through the\nreadiness review process\n. The effort and timing for a readiness review will vary depending on the complexity of the feature. It is recommended to start this process as early as practical when a significant number of the questions can be answered but not too late to further develop the feature based on learnings from the review.\nEnsure there are\napplication limits\nfor your product areas enabled on GitLab.com to reduce\nabuse vectors\n.\nInfradev\nThe\ninfradev process\nis used to triage issues requiring priority attention in support of SaaS availability and reliability. As part of the broader effort to responsibly manage tech debt across the company, PMs should partner with their EMs to identify and\nincorporate\ninfradev labeled issues of\nall severities\n. Note, issues labeled with a severity must be mitigated and resolved within\nspecific time frames\nto meet the SLO. As EMs are the DRIs for prioritizing infradev work, PMs should familiarize themselves with the\ninfradev process\nand\nBoard\n.\nOther resources PMs can consult to identify and prioritize Infradev issues include:\nError Budgets\nand\nassociated dashboards\nThe weekly triage report emailed to PMs\nnow includes infradev items\nto prevent missing SLOs.\nLargest Contentful Paint\nmetrics to monitor application performance.\nWhile not required, PMs are encouraged to listen in on\nIncident Management\ncalls for incidents related to their product areas to 1) build empathy with the SRE team by gaining insight into how they handle incidents 2) gain a better sense of the impact of the incident to their customer base, and 3) identify improvements to their product areas, whether technical or feature-related, that could have prevented the incident. PMs are not expected to be in the decision-making path on actions taken to resolve the incident. They are there to listen and learn rather than attempting to decide/influence the course of resolution. After incidents involving their product area, PMs are also encouraged to engage in the\nIncident Review\n, including attendance at the\nSync Incident Review\ncall if their incident is scheduled. PMs can periodically review incidents via the\nProduction Incident Board\nEnterprise Customer Needs\nEnterprise customers interested in adopting SaaS may have common hard requirements to be able to use the product. For example, large enterprises may need certain security related features, such as Audit Logs, available before their security team will agree to the use of GitLab.com. This can also be about more than just features; it may include how and where we apply features so they can administrate their GitLab instance at enterprise-scale. For instance, permission management and shared configurations are best implemented top-down first instead of Project-up to meet the requirements of large organizations who may have 100s or 1000s of projects and only a small handful of people to perform these system-wide administrative tasks. In order to encourage more Enterprise adoption of GitLab.com, prioritize these common ‚Äúhard-blockers‚Äù to adoption over ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù features. PMs can use customer interviews to hone in on which issues are hard blockers to adopting SaaS vs more ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù features that can be delivered later.\nTo track hard adoption blockers, use the ~‚ÄúGitLab.com Enterprise Readiness‚Äù label within the\nGitLab-Org\nand\nGitLab-com\ngroups.\nSaaS Features\nThere are a few special considerations when it comes to delivering features for SaaS. In order to achieve\nparity between SaaS and Self-managed installations\nPMs should prioritize efforts to eliminate existing feature gaps that exist\nacross the two installations\n. Additionally, new features should ship for SaaS and self-managed at the same time. Features should be implemented at the group level first, before being implemented at the instance level, so that they will work across\nboth self-managed and SaaS\n. Finally, in order for new features to be adequately monitored, they should include\nappropriate logging and observability\n, which makes troubleshooting much easier.\nWorking with Your Group\nAs a product manager, you will be assigned as the\nstable counterpart\nto a single\ngroup\n. At GitLab we abide by\nunique, and extremely beneficial guidelines when interacting with our groups. These include:\nProduct managers are the\nDRIs\nfor overall work prioritization but work collaboratively with their EM, UX, and QEM stable counterparts to ensure the right priorities from each\nwork type\nare considered as each has a different DRI. Product Managers are responsible for communicating overall priority.\nProduct Managers provide the what and when for feature work. Engineering (UX, Backend, Frontend, Quality) provide the how. This process is documented as part of our monthly\nproduct\n,\nengineering\nand\ncadence. We\ndefine stable counterparts for each of these functions\nwithin a group.\nAs an all-remote company, our crispness when it comes to responsibilities throughout the Product Delivery process was born out of necessity, but it pays untold dividends. Some of the benefits include:\nWe avoid the ambiguity in handoffs between teams\nWe avoid the confusion of many responsible individuals\nWe avoid the slowness of consensus driven decision making\nWe avoid the disruption of frequent context switching\nWe gain the rigidity to be consistent\nWe gain the freedom to iterate quickly\nFrom Prioritization to Execution\nAs described above, prioritization is a multi-faceted problem. In order to\ntranslate the priorities of any given group into action by our engineering\nteams, we need to be able to translate this multi-faceted problem into a flat\nlist of priorities for at least the next release cycle. Product Managers are\nresponsible for taking all these prioritization considerations\nand creating a\nclear, sequenced list of next priorities. This list should be represented as an\nissue board\nso that each team has a clear interface for making decisions about work. From\nthis list, Product Designers, Engineering Managers and Product Managers can work together to\ndetermine what items will be selected for work in the immediate future.\nThis does not mean that items will be addressed in strict order - Product Designers, EMs and PMs\nneed to be cognizant of dependencies, available skill sets, and the\nrock/pebbles/sand\nproblem of time management to make the best decisions about selecting work.\nReviewing Build Plans\nTogether with your Engineering Manager, you will have an important role in ensuring that the Build Plans defined for issues are created with iteration in mind. Iteration is highly valuable for the following reasons:\nIt can result in discovering ways to parallelize effort, resulting in less team WIP and increase throughput\nIt can result in shipping something of value during an iteration rather then delaying everything\nIt can re-risk unknown unknowns by bringing them to light sooner in the development process\nPrioritizing for Predictability\nAs a company we emphasize\nvelocity over predictability\n. As a product manager this means\nyou focus on prioritizing, not scheduling issues. Your engineering\nstable counterparts\nare\nresponsible for velocity and delivery. However, there are instances when there is desire for predictability, including:\nSecurity\n, Bugs and Infra priorities with SLOs\nCustomer Commitments\nInfrastructure projects with IACV driver impact or those that result in significant cost savings for gitlab.com\nInfrastructure projects with customer commitment or heavily upvoted should be given a priority indicative of other customer commitments\nVision or Direction items for a launch\nAs the DRI for\nmilestone prioritization\n, it is the Product Manager‚Äôs job to prioritize for predictability when it is needed. You should do so by ensuring you prioritize a deliverable, and its dependencies, so that it can reasonably be expected to be delivered by any committed dates. If there is time pressure to hit a date, the PM should also explore de-scoping the issue to meet the deadline, rather than pressuring engineering to move abnormally fast or cut corners.\nPrivate tools and dashboards for monitoring and KPI tracking\nThese information sources may be useful to help you prioritize.\nFeature usage\nEE usage\n: dev.gitlab.org account\nGrafana\n: Google gitlab.com account\nKibana\n: dev.gitlab.org account\nS3stat\n: GitLab 1Password account\nSentry\n: dev.gitlab.org account\nGlobal Prioritization\nIndividual product managers must consider, and advocate for\nglobal optimizations\nwithin the teams they are assigned to. If your assigned team requires expertise\n(remember\neveryone can\ncontribute)\noutside the team you should make all reasonable efforts to proceed forward\nwithout the hard dependency while advocating within the product management team\nfor increased prioritization of your now soft dependencies.\nExecution of a Global prioritization can take many forms.  This is worked with both Product and Engineering Leadership engaged.  Either party can activate a proposal in this area.  The options available and when to use them are the following:\nRapid action\n- use when reassignment isn‚Äôt necessary, the epic can have several issues assigned to multiple teams\nBorrow\n- use when a temporary assignment (less than 6 months) to a team is required to help resolve an issue/epic\nScope Reassignment\n- use when scope that will take longer than 6 months to deliver is a high priority and the team member reporting structure does not need to change to accomplish the effort.\nRealignment\n- use when a permanent assignment to a team is required to resolve ongoing challenges. This has the highest impact to team members and should be considered if other options cannot achieve the desired goal. We strive to hire team members in the groups that will need them most.\nWe have found the following methods less successful in ensuring completion of work that warrants global prioritization:\nWorking Groups\n- This method involves convening a group of individuals who maintain full-time responsibility to other\nProduct Groups\nand completing work as part of the working group structure. This method isn‚Äôt preferred for completing product improvements, instead it can be utilized to scope work, or determine plans for future product delivery.\nFan Out Prioritization - This method of prioritization involves communicating a global prioritization to a number of\nProduct Groups\nin an effort to ensure each individual product group‚Äôs PM prioritizes the work in the time frame you‚Äôd prefer.  This method requires significant coordination costs and puts delivery at risk due to the lack of central prioritization responsibility. In most cases it is preferred to execute a scope reassignment, borrow or realignment to complete the improvements.\nPlanning and Direction\nAs a PM, you must plan for the near term milestones (more detailed) as well as for the long\nterm strategy (more broad), and everything in between.\nWhile monthly milestone planning is done in GitLab, longer horizon planning (1-3 years) is done in direction pages.\nThis will enable you to efficiently communicate both internally and externally\nhow the team is planning to deliver on the\nproduct vision\n.\nManaging your Product Direction\nDocumenting a Section, Stage, Group and Category direction is critical to communicating where we are heading and why to all of our stakeholders. This is especially important to the members of your Product Group. Establishing a direction for stakeholders (including team members) to participate in, and contribute to ensures there is a concrete connection to ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù we are iterating and how it furthers\nGitLab‚Äôs mission\n. Here are some of those connections:\nImproving Product Performance Indicators - Usage represents market capture (whether paying or not), and the start of our dual fly-wheel. For existing customers that market capture in new capabilities also represents increased retention and because of the benefits of a single application - user satisfaction.\nImproving Competitiveness against\nalternative DevOps tools\n- Leads to increased Stages Per user, and sales as they add to our ‚ÄúIncrease Operational Efficiency‚Äù\nAs a Product Manager you can highlight these connections in:\nDirection Content and Overview Videos\nWeekly Meetings\nIndividual Issue Descriptions\nPlanning Issues\nKickoff Videos\nCustomer Discovery Interview Summaries\nCommunicating this connection requires a multi-channel approach. We should strive to\nshare\nand communication about the connection to our Direction warrants consistent reinforcement.\nSection and Stage Direction\nSection leaders are responsible for maintaining Direction pages that lay out the strategy and plan for their respective section and stages. The direction pages should include topics outlined in this\ntemplate\n.\nCategory Direction\nA category strategy is required which should outline various information about\nthe category including overall strategy, status, what‚Äôs next, and the competitive landscape.\nThe category strategy should be documented in a handbook page, which allows for version control\nof the category strategy as well as the ability to embed video assets.\nOne of the most important pieces of information to include in the category strategy is a tangible next step or MVC\nand a clear description of focus and out-of-focus/maintenance areas.\nYour category strategies should contain short paragraphs with lots of references to specific epics and issues.\nReferencing topics, instead of features is encouraged as it‚Äôs more stable over time.\nWe use this\ncategory strategy template\nas the outline for creating the handbook pages. If additional headings are needed you are empowered\nto create and populate them in your category strategy. You must keep these categories in sync with\ncategories.yml\nand for\nnew categories.\nCategory direction should be reviewed on a regular basis (at least monthly) by the responsible product\nmanager. To indicate the last time a category direction page was reviewed, please ensure pages\ninclude\nContent Last Reviewed: yyyy-mm-dd\nat the top of the category content. Update this date with every\nreview, even if other content on the direction page has not changed.\nYou should link to your category strategy from your stage strategy page.\nFor categories that have already shipped, and that have a marketing\nproduct page,\ncategories.yml\nshould link to the product page.\nInside of the\ncategories.yml\nfile there are dates assigned for either achieved or anticipated maturity achievement. These should be kept inline with communicated dates for achievement and updated as required.\nIf the category has developed a\nUX Roadmap\nwe recommend the product designer to create a merge request to incorporate UX Roadmap themes into the category direction page roadmap. Assign the MR to the PM for review and merge.\nNavigating cross-stage or cross-section direction pages\nIn some cases there may be direction pages that span multiple stages or sections. A direction page that summarizes the collective vision as well as all the contributors of that direction is critical to maintain transparency and adequate assignment of ownership.\nThere are several examples of these types of direction pages today:\nSoftware Supply Chain Security Direction\nAutoDevOps Direction\nMonorepo Product Direction\nVersioned Dependencies Direction\nCustomizable Dashboards Direction\nThe steps for creating and managing a cross-section or stage direction are:\nCreate a direction page merge request adding the direction page to the\nGitLab direction directory\nSelect the category change template in the merge request\nFollow the process for\ncategory changes\nAdd\nby adding an entry with the direction page link and the page DRI GitLab Handle.\nOnce approved,\n@\nall relevant product managers on the addition\nOnce the direction page has been added, there needs to be an assigned DRI for maintaining monthly updates for the page. It is the DRIs responsibility to ensure the shared direction page is regularly reviewed and is up to date. This requires cross-section / cross-stage collaboration from the DRI.\nWhat makes a Product Direction issue?\nYou should use the\n~direction\nlabel together with category and section labels to mark epics and issues that fall into the given direction.\nProduct Direction items (i.e., with the label) should be direction-level items that move the strategy forward meaningfully. This is up to the PM to set the bar for, but there should be a clear step forward with real user value.\nIt‚Äôs important to note here that your plan\nis not\nsimply a list of new features and innovation.\nThose are included for sure, but so are issues related to all of your\nsensing mechanisms\n.\nA category upgrade from minimal to viable or delivery of a top customer issue (for example) can contribute to your plan just as much as a brilliant new innovative feature can. It‚Äôs up to PMs to balance this through a coherent longer-term strategy.\nConversely, in a broad sense anything could move the plan forward in a general way.\nFinally, issues are the substance of your plan. Ensure you are applying the label to both revelant epics\nand\nits issues.\nCommunicating dates\nAs product managers, a core job is to set the correct expectations. We do this typically through discussing our direction and assigning issues to milestones. When you need to communicate specific dates, it‚Äôs recommended doing it with limited visibility internally or directly to the customers. When you need to communicate specific dates use\ncalendar year (CY) dates\n. Fiscal year (FY) does not translate well outside the company.\nAccordingly, the direction pages are expected to refer to specific issues only for the next 3-4 months. Everything beyond that should discuss the topic, not specific issues.\nPlanning is indispensable but adjust, iterate\nCreating a thoughtful direction for your section, stage, or category is a useful thought exercise that can help focus efforts, aid in prioritization, and get large groups of people on the same page. But beware of simply executing your long term plan. Our industry is incredibly dynamic, and we learn new things every day that can and should cause us to re-think our long term plans.\nDelivery follows discovery\nWe should ship what brings value to our customers, not what is easy to ship. Stay focused on creating value each and every milestone, and be quick to adjust your longer term direction as you learn more.\nWhen working on a larger theme, you should start with validating the end state knowing that it will change as you start shipping features and you learn more from actual usage.\nOnce the final vision is validated, you should work with your designer and engineering counterparts to break it down to the smallest possible iterations in order to ship value quickly.\nYou might still prefer to validate the first ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù before getting into delivery.\nIt‚Äôs totally fine to never ship the initial vision and refine the vision after every iteration. A feature not built is much more valuable than a feature that is built but never used.\nMaturity Plans\nFor each category, we recommend tracking the improvements required to advance to the next level of\nmaturity\n. You are welcome to track maturity plans either with\n~maturity::...\nlabels or maturity issues.\nMaturity plans are highly encouraged - but not required - for non-marketing categories.\nPlanning and OKRs\nProduct groups may choose to have\nOKRs\n.\nTo use them effectively, you should have plans for the next three months in terms of driving specific product metrics through discovery and delivery actions.\nYou should discuss the product metrics with your manager, your design and engineering counterparts and the actions to reach the results with your design and engineering counterparts.\nPlanning Issue for Milestone\nFor each milestone, the planning quads come together to scope and plan work for the group for the upcoming milestone. Planning begins asynchronously with the creation of the planning issue. The planning issue is the SSOT for communication and all resources that are needed to plan a successful milestone. There are many ways to achieve to plan a milestone that should be curated based on the needs of the team. Below are a few examples of planning issues from groups acorss R&D to aid you in creating one that works best for your team.\nVerify::Pipeline Execution\nVerify::Testing\nMonitor::Respond\nCreate::Code Review\nCreate::Editor\nData Stores::Database\nAs you adapt your own issue, it is recommended you apply the label\nplanning issue\nto aid in tracking and to incorporate our\nProduct Principles\ninto the process.\nManaging Upcoming Releases\nRefer to the\nProduct Development Timeline\nfor details on how Product works with UX and Engineering to schedule and work on\nissues in upcoming releases.\nPlanning for Future Releases\nThere are two non-exclusionary ways to plan and communicate work for future releases\nPlanning with boards\nAs a Product Manager you can maintain prioritization of your groups issues using\na fully prioritized issue board where the ordering of the issues reflects their priority.\nPlanning with milestones\nProduct Managers can assign milestones to issues to indicate when an issue is likely\nto be scheduled and worked on.\nStill, whether an issue can be delivered within a milestone is the decision of the engineering team.\nAs we consider more distant milestones, the certainty of\nthe scope of their assigned issues and their implementation timelines is increasingly\nvague. In particular, issues may be moved to another project, disassembled, or merged\nwith other issues over time as they bounce between different milestones.\nThe milestone of an issue can be changed at any moment. The current assigned milestone\nreflects the current planning, so if the plan changes, the milestone should be updated\nas soon as possible to reflect the changed plan. We make sure to do this ahead\nof starting work on a release. Capacity is discussed between the PMs and the\nengineering managers.\nThere are helper labels to signals these plans like\n~next::1-3 releases\nand its variants.\nSpecial milestones\nIn addition, we have two special milestones:\nBacklog\nand\nAwaiting further demand\n.\nProduct Managers assign these issues to milestones that they have reviewed and\nmake sense, but do not fit within the upcoming release milestones due to either\na lack of comparative urgency or because we have not yet seen enough user\ndemand to prioritize the item yet. The best way to demonstrate urgency on\neither of these items is to vote on them and, if possible, add comments\nexplaining your use case and why this is important to you.\nRecommendation for when to change ‚ÄòAwaiting further demand‚Äô:\nAlways focus on the overall value of the feature.\nDo you have a good understanding of the user problem?\nDo you have a good understanding of the impacted user base?\nWas the proposed solution validated?\nIssues with the ‚ÄòAwaiting further demand‚Äô label often mean poorly understood requests that require more information from our users and the market.\nOften public feedback only comes from a small percentage of people using or evaluating a feature or product.\nYou should always consider reaching out directly to our users to learn more about their use cases.\nRecommendation when changing a previously planned issue to\nBacklog\n:\nWhen moving\na previously planned issue to\nBacklog\n, especially one planned for within the next release or two,\nconsider the message that this may be sending to parties that were interested in this feature.\nIn some cases, they may have been depending or planning upon the issue to be delivered around\nthe assigned milestone, and with the change to\nBacklog\nthat is now unlikely to occur. In these instances,\nit is best to concisely explain the rationale behind the change in a comment, so\nthe community can understand and potentially respond with additional justification or\ncontext. It is also encouraged to move the issue to the\nBacklog\nas soon as it is clear that it will not be scheduled in the near future. This will help with understanding the change, as it will not seem like a last minute change.\nCommunicating clearly changing priorities might encourage the community to contribute the issue to GitLab.\nAgain, the milestone of an issue can be changed at any moment, including for both\nof these special milestones.\nShifting commitment mid-iteration\nFrom time to time, there may be circumstances that change the ability for a team\nto ship the features/issues they committed to at the beginning of the iteration.\nThese steps also apply when an issue is broken into multiple issues.\nWhen this happens, as a PM you must coordinate with your EM counterpart that\nthe impacted issues and their milestones\nare updated to reflect the new reality (for example, remove\ndeliverable\ntag, update\nmilestone\n, etc.). Additionally, notify your manager of the shift.\nUtilizing our design system to work autonomously\nOur\ndesign system\nprovides the means to work\nautonomously, without always needing UX insight, feedback and design. When problems can\nbe solved using an already documented paradigm, you don‚Äôt need to wait for UX\napproval to bring an issue to a reasonable state within a first iteration.\nIf lingering questions remain, subsequent iterations can address any shortcomings\nthe feature might have.\nAlways consider that with a dedicated product designer, it‚Äôs much faster and cheaper to iterate on a design than to re-implement it.\nAt the same time, not everything needs a design, and the design system is here to support your engineers and you in those cases.\nIteration Strategies\nIteration is a core value of GitLab, and product management has a central role to play in it. Iteration should be apparent as we deliver new features in MVCs, but it has implications for discovery too. As solution validation can move much faster than delivery, we should aim to validate features before building them. At this point, the feature validated is likely way bigger than an MVC if we would build it. We should pay special attention as product managers to still aim at iterative delivery after a bigger feature-set got validated, as delivered features provide the final validation. For example, once a direction is validated, we can start the delivery by documentation. As product managers we should aim to iterate as part of solution validation, and while delivering already validated solutions too.\nHere are several strategies for breaking features down into tiny changes that can be developed and released iteratively. This process will also help you critically evaluate if every facet of the design is actually necessary.\nWorkflow steps\nAs part of design and discovery, you likely created a minimal user journey that contains sequential steps a user is going to take to ‚Äúuse‚Äù the feature you are building. Each of these should be separated. You can further by asking yourself these questions:\nCan/is it desirable to perform this action via the UI or can we use a non-UI approach as a start (for example, CLI, API or .csv download of data)? This is a great starting point before adding UI components that achieve the same thing.\nWill there be different UI paths to perform the same task? Identify which are the most useful and which are the easiest to implement. Weight both factors when determining which to start with, and build from there.\nUser operations\nView, Create, Update, Remove and Delete are actions users take while interacting with software. These actions naturally provide lines along which you can split functionality into smaller features. By doing this, you prioritize the most important actions first. For example, users will likely need to be able to visually consume information before they can create, update, remove, or delete.\nFunctional criteria\nOften, the criteria for features are built on is implicit. It can help to use a test-driven development mindset where you write the tests and the outcomes you need from the software before building the software. Writing these tests can uncover the different criteria you need the development team to meet when building the new feature. Once you‚Äôve outlined these tests, you may be able to use them to continue to break down the feature into smaller parts for each test. Here are a few examples:\nWhat is the default behavior when there is no data (empty/null state)?\nAre there automatic actions or events that occur as part of your feature? Write them down, and identify those that can be done manually by the user before adding automation.\nWill users of different roles have unique experiences? Can you prioritize and build one of these experiences first? (for example: guest, user, developer, maintainer).\nDo users want to be able to customize their view of information? Define all of the customizations you want to offer, and build them one at a time (for example, toggle on/off, filter, sort, search).\nException & error cases\nSoftware often fails and can fail in different ways depending upon how it is architected. It is always best to provide the user with as much information as possible as to why something did not behave as expected. Creating and building different states to handle all possible errors and exceptions can easily be broken down into individual issues. Start by creating a generic error state to display when anything goes wrong, and then add on to handle different cases one by one. Remember to always make error messages\nuseful\n, and add additional error messages as you identify new error states.\nBreaking down the UI\nBreaking down a design into pieces that can be released iteratively is going to depend on what you are building. Here are a few helpful questions to guide that process:\nWhat components already exist that you can reuse to go faster?\nWhat constitutes ‚Äúextra styling‚Äù? Is there a way to display the information you need to display plainly and then add details later?\nDo you have lots of interactions in the design that make the UX lovable? Can you pull those out into separate issues and add them iteratively? (e.g. hover states, drag & drop, toggles, options to show/hide info, collapse/expand, etc)\nRefactors\nContinuously improving the software we write is important. If we don‚Äôt proactively work through\ntechnical debt\nand\nDeferred UX\nas we progress, we will end up spending more time and moving slower in the long run. However, it is important to strike the right balance between technical debt, deferred UX, and iteratively developing features. Here are some questions to consider:\nWhat is the impact if we do not refactor this code right now?\nCan we refactor some of it? Is a full re-write necessary?\nWhy do we need to use that new technology? (You may need to ask WHY multiple times to get to the root of the problem)\nSeparate announcement from launch\nFor large projects, consider separating the announcement from the actual feature launch. By doing so, it can create more freedom to iterate during the customer rollout. For example, you could announce in advance to give customers ample notice, and then roll it out to new customers first, then to existing Free customers, then to existing paid customers. Or you could do the opposite, and roll it out to customers first, before announcing broadly, to ensure the user experience is great before making a marketing splash.\nWhen considering dates for a product announcement or launch that may impact our Field team, consider the\nblockout restrictions\nrecognized by the Field team to ensure there won‚Äôt be any major disruption to the business near quarter end.\nFour phase transition\nSometimes the objective is to cut over from one experience, or one system, to another. When doing so, consider having four transition phases rather than a hard cut over. The phases are: 1) Old experience. 2) Run the old experience and new experience side-by-side, with the old experience the default, and the new experience is gradually rolled out to a subset of users. 3) Run them side-by-side, with the new experience the default for the majority, but the old experience is still available as a fallback in case of problems. 4) Deprecate the old experience and offer only the new experience. This strategy enables teams to have more flexibility and demonstrate more iteration in the rollout, with reduced risk.\nIterate to go faster\nWhen something is important, it is natural to want to launch it all at once to get to the end game faster. However, big bang style launches tend to need everything perfect before they can happen, which takes longer. With iteration you get feedback about all the things that aren‚Äôt a problem and are done enough. It‚Äôs better to launch in small increments, with a tight feedback loop, so that the majority of users have a great experience. This tends to speed up the overall timeline, rather than slow it down.\nRemote Design Sprint\nDesign Sprint\n, is a 5-day process used to answer critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers. This method allows us to\nreduce cycle time\nwhen coming up with a solution.\nAs an all-remote company we run\nRemote Design Sprints (RDS)\n. Check out our\nguidelines for running an RDS\nto determine if it‚Äôs the right approach for the problem at hand.\nSpikes\nIf you‚Äôre faced with a very large or complex problem, and it‚Äôs not clear how to most efficiently iterate towards the desired outcome, consider working with your engineers to build an experimental\nspike solution\n. This process is also sometimes referred to as a ‚Äútechnical evaluation.‚Äù When conducting a spike, the goal is write as little code within the shortest possible time frame to provide the level of information necessary the team needs to determine how to best proceed. At the end of the spike, code is usually discarded as the original goal was to learn, not build production-ready solutions. This process is particularly useful for major refactors and creating\narchitecture blueprints\n.\nFeedback issues\nWhen launching a feature that could be controversial or in which you want to get the audience‚Äôs feedback, it is recommended to create a feedback issue.\nTimeline:\nCreate the issue and include in the release post.\nIf announcing in Slack or doing dogfooding, include a link to the feedback issue\nLeave the issue open for at least 14 days after launch\nRespond and catalog the feedback into separate issues\nClose the issue once the time frame has passed and summarize the learnings from the feedback issue\nHere are some examples of feedback issues:\nWebIDE\nFonts\nmaster\n->\nmain\nFeedback issue considerations\nFeedback issues are intended to collect feedback from the wider community and users. In some cases, internal user will be posting on behalf of users and customers. As a result we need to consider the following:\nFeedback issues that are public cannot contain\ninformation\nA linked confidential issue for Field feedback can be used, if needed, to support the exchange of customer details and feedback\nLeverage\ninternal comments\nas needed if customer details are being shared\nOther best practice considerations\nConsider the following to improve iteration:\nSuccessfully iterating should mean you‚Äôre delivering value in the most efficient way possible. Sometimes, this can mean fixing an underlying technical issue prior to delivering a customer facing feature.\nWherever possible, consider reuse of components that already exist in the product. A great example of this was our approach to creating our Jira importer, which reused the Jira service integration. Reuse also aligns well with our efficiency value.\nAvoid technical dependencies across teams, if possible. This will increase the coordination cost of shipping and lead to a slow down in iteration. Break down silos if you notice them and consider implementing whatever you need yourself.\nConsider a quick POC that can be enabled for small portion of our user base, especially on GitLab.com. An example of this was search, where it was originally enabled just for a few groups to start, then slowly rolled out.\nGreat collaboration leads to great iteration. Amazing MVCs are rarely created simply by product managers, they often arise out of collaboration and discussion between product, engineering, design, quality, etc.\nKeep the initial problem statement front and center for the team. Tight problem statements enable the team to identify a tight, iterative solution.\nBring data to the table early to help the team triangulate on the smallest iteration that will have the largest impact in solving the identified problem.\nIf the project is multi-phase, consider iterative targets and guardrails to help the team focus on the next iterative milestone, rather than the final end state goal.\nIf your team needs to do repetitive work on behalf of customers, partners, or other GitLab teams, consider using a framework approach so that dependent teams can self-serve.\nCommunity participation\nEngaging directly with the community of users is an important part of a PM‚Äôs job. We\nencourage participation and active response alongside GitLab‚Äôs\nDeveloper Relations team\n.\nConferences\nA general list of conferences the company is participating in can be found on our\ncorporate marketing\nproject.\nThere are a few notable conferences that we would typically always send PMs to:\nKubeCon\nAtlassian Summit\nGitHub Universe\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nGoogle Next\nAWS Reinvent\nVelocity\nIf you‚Äôre interested in attending, check out the issue in the corporate marketing\nsite and volunteer there, or reach out to your manager if you don‚Äôt see it listed\nyet.\nStakeholder Management\nWhat is a Stakeholder?\nA stakeholder, or stable counterpart, is someone that is outside of your direct team who meets one or more of the following:\nIs directly or indirectly impacted\nHas the ability to stop, delay, or cancel\nExamples of stakeholders include Leadership, Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, and Customer Success. You may have stakeholders in any area of GitLab depending on your focus area and the specific issue. Stakeholders are also present outside of GitLab, for example, when a feature is being developed for a specific customer or set of customers. If you‚Äôre not sure who the stakeholder is to collaborate with or keep informed, visit\nproduct sections, stages, groups, and categories\n.\nUpdated SSOT for stakeholder collaboration\nStakeholder collaboration and feedback is a critical competitive advantage here\nat GitLab. To ensure this is possible, and facilitate collaboration, you should\nmaintain an updated single source of truth (SSOT) of your stage direction, category\nstrategies, and plan, at all times. This equips anyone who wants to contribute to\nyour stage‚Äôs product direction with the latest information in order to effectively\ncollaborate. Some sections and teams use the\nscheduled Direction Update issue template\nto\nremind themselves of this task.\nActively and regularly reach out to stakeholders. Encourage them to view and collaborate\non these artifacts via these (non-exhaustive) opportunities:\nEngage with users in epics, issues, and merge requests on GitLab.com.\nMeet with customers directly.\nParticipate in the\n.\nTalk with GitLab team-members using GitLab.\nTalk with other PMs and\nProduct leadership\nto align your stage‚Äôs product direction with the rest of GitLab.\nHere is some guidance for new PMs to ensure your stage direction, category strategies and plan\nare up-to-date and visible to critical stakeholders:\nSeek feedback from the\nonce every six months.\nPresent your plan to your manager once a month.\nPresent the plan and stage/category strategies to your stable counterparts\nPresent your stage strategy and plan in a\ncustomer meeting\nonce every two weeks.\nPresent changes to your stage strategy, category strategies, and plan to your\nstage group weekly meeting once a month.\nWorking with customers\nCustomer meetings\nIt‚Äôs important to get direct feedback from our customers on things we‚Äôve built, are building, or should be building. Some opportunities to do that will arise during\nsales support meetings\n. As a PM you should also have dedicated\ncustomer discovery meetings\nor\ncontinuous interviews\nwith customers and prospects to better understand their pain points. As a PM you should facilitate opportunities for your engineering group to hear directly from customers too. Try to schedule customer meetings at times that are friendly to your group, invite them, and send them the recording and notes.  If you‚Äôre looking for other ways to engage with customers here is a video on\nfinding, preparing for, and navigating Customer Calls as a Product Manager at GitLab\n.\nSales support meetings\nBefore the meeting\n, ensure the Sales lead on the account has provided you with sufficient\nbackground documentation to ensure a customer doesn‚Äôt have to repeat information they‚Äôve already\nprovided to GitLab.\nDuring the meeting\n, spend most of your time listening and obtaining information.\nIt‚Äôs not your job to sell GitLab, but it should be obvious when it‚Äôs the time\nto give more information about our products.\nFor message consistency purposes, utilize the\nValue Drivers\nframework when posing questions and soliciting information.\nAfter the meeting:\nCreate an interview snapshot\nsummarizing the meeting in the\ngitlab-com/user-interviews\nproject.\nThis project is private so that detailed and unredacted feedback can be shared internally.\nLink the Google Doc where detailed notes were taken.\nCreate or update related issues to publicly document feedback.\nThe synthesis of feedback from multiple meetings should happen publicly in an epic or issue.\nCustomer discovery meetings\nCustomer discovery meetings aren‚Äôt UX Research. Target them to broad-based needs\nand plan tradeoff discussions, not specific feature review. There are\ntwo primary techniques for targeting those topics:\nTop Competitors\n- Identify the top 3 competitors in your categories and talk to\ncustomers using those competitor asking: What is missing to have you switch from\nX to us? We‚Äôre not aiming for feature parity with competitors, and we‚Äôre not\njust looking at the features competitors talk about, but we‚Äôre talking with\ncustomers about what they actually use, and ultimately what they\nneed\n.\nUser Need\n- Identify GitLab users from key customers of your group‚Äôs\ncategories and features. Solicit them for what they love about the features and\nask about their current pain points with both the features as well as the surrounding\nworkflows when using those components of GitLab?\nFollow the below guidance to prepare and conduct Customer Discovery Meetings:\nSet up a meeting:\nIdentify what you‚Äôre interested in learning and prepare appropriately\nYou can find information about how customers are using GitLab through Sales and version.gitlab.com. Sales and support should also be able to bring you into contact with customers\nThere is no formal internal process to schedule a customer meeting, however you can check\nthis template\nfor gathering questions from interested parties and for capturing the notes during the customer discovery meetings.\nDuring the meeting:\nSpend most of your time listening and documenting information\nListen for pain points, delightful moments and frustrations\nRead back and review what you‚Äôve written down with the customer to ensure you‚Äôve captured it correctly.\nAfter the meeting:\nDocument your findings. Create a folder (sharable only within GitLab) in\nGoogle Drive\nwith a structure as follows:\nCustomer Meetings\nCustomer Name A\n2020-04-01\nagenda (Google Doc)\nartifacts (folder for docs, images, etc.)\n2020-10-03\nCustomer Name B\nCompetitive Research\nVendors\nVendor A\nsummary (Google Doc, optional)\n2020-04-01\n2020-10-03\nVendor B\nProjects\nproduct-10132-code-scan-results (reference GitLab issue number)\nux-13840-selector-widget\nShare your findings with your fellow product managers and the sales and customer success account teams for the customer\nMake appropriate adjustments to category strategies, feature epics, and personas\nYou can find some additional guidance on conducting Customer Discovery Meetings from these resources:\nHow to Interview Your Customers\nEffective User Interviews\nSourcing customers\nPMs should also feel free to collect and evaluate customer feedback independently. Looking at\nexisting\nresearch can yield helpful\nthemes as well as potential customers to contact. You can use the following techniques to source customers directly:\nGitLab Solution Architects\nknow our customers the best, especially from a technical perspective.\nGitLab Issues\ncustomers will often comments on issues, especially when the problem described by the issue\nis a problem they are experiencing firsthand. The best strategy is to capture their feedback directly on the issue,\nhowever, there are times when this is not possible or simply doesn‚Äôt happen. You can find alternative contact info by clicking on the user‚Äôs handle to see their\nGitLab user page; this page often includes contact information such as Twitter or LinkedIn. Another option is to\ndirectly mention users in issues to engage async. In popular issues you can just leave a general comment that you‚Äôre looking for people to interview and many will often volunteer.\nCustomer Issues Prioritization Dashboards:\nThe\ncustomer issues prioritization framework\naggregates customer data with the issues and epics that they have requested. When\nviewing the dashboard\n, double click on the issue or epic of interest within the ‚Äúpriority score by noteable‚Äù table then scroll down to ‚ÄúQA Table - User request weighting by customer‚Äù to see the specific customers that are interested in the issue or epic.\nGitLab.com Broadcast Messages\nBroadcast Messaging is a great tool for acquiring customer feedback from within the product. You can leverage\nthis workflow\nto use broadcast messaging.\nGitLab Sales and Customer Success\nYou can ask for help in\nSlack customer success channel\nor join the Field Sales Team Call and the All CS Team Call to present a specific request via the Zoom call.\nCustomer Success Managers (CSM)\nIf a customer has a dedicated CSM, they may also have a regular meeting with a CSM. These meetings are a great opportunity to spend 15 minutes getting high-level feedback on an idea or problem. In Salesforce, CSMs are listed in the Customer Success section in the customer‚Äôs account information. CSMs are also very familiar with the feature requests submitted by their customers and can help identify customers that may be interested in the feature you are working on.\nZendesk\nis a great tool to find users who are actively making use of a feature and either came across a\nquestion or an issue. Users who‚Äôve had recent challenges using the product really appreciate PMs taking the time to learn from\ntheir experience. This establishes that we are willing to listen to users, even if they are not having a great experience.\nThis is also a great opportunity to discuss the roadmap and provide context so that users understand what we are going to improve.\nThe best way to request a chat is through the support ticket; however, you can also click\non the user that initiated the interaction and their contact information will display on the left hand side panel.\nIf you don‚Äôt have a Zendesk account, see\nhow to request a light agent Zendesk account\n.\nYou can use\nZendesk‚Äôs trigger feature\nto receive email alerts when specific keywords relevant\nto your product area are mentioned in a support ticket. Additionally, it is possible to create a simple dashboard that lists all the currently active support tickets that match the trigger. Reach out\nin #support_escalations to receive some help in setting this up.\nSocial Media\ncan also be effective. If your personal account has a reasonable number of connections/followers, you can post your desire to connect with users on a specific question directly. When posting, remember to include the subject you want to discuss as well as how people can reach out. You can also reach out to the\n#social-media\nchannel to have your tweet retweeted by the @gitlab account.\nIf you want to reach a wider audience, consider asking a community advocate to re-post using the official GitLab account for the relevant platform.\nYou can reach advocates on the\n#community-advocates\nSlack channel.\nYou can also reach out to authors of articles related to tech your team is working on, via various publications such as\nMedium\n. A clear and brief email\nvia the publication website or LinkedIn is a good way to engage.\nYou‚Äôre able to request a\nLinkedIn Recruiter license\n. This\nUnfiltered video\nand\nslide deck\nprovide an overview on how to use LinkedIn Recruiter to source participants for your study.\nIf you‚Äôve tried these tactics and are still having challenges getting the customer feedback you need, connect with your manager for support and\nthen consider leveraging the\nUX Research team\n.\nAdditionally, you can connect with Product Operations directly or by attending Product Operations Office Hours for troubleshooting support.\nNon-users\nare often more important than GitLab users. They can provide the necessary critical view to come up with\nideas that might turn them into GitLab users in the end. The best non-users are the ones who don‚Äôt even plan on switching\nto GitLab. You can reach these people at local meetups, conferences or online groups like, Hacker News. In every such case,\nyou should not try to interview the user on spot, instead organize a separate meeting where nobody will be distracted, and\nboth of you can arrive prepared.\nCustomer Advisory Board meetings\nOne specific, recurring opportunity to get direct feedback from highly engaged customers\nis the\nGitLab DevOps Customer Advisory Board\n.\nYou may be asked by the CAB to present your stage at these meetings. Here are\nsome guidelines when doing so:\nYou may be asked by the CAB to present your stage or a specific product offering at these meetings.  Here are some guidelines for presenting:\nProduct Focused Highlights: All presentation materials should be focused on products we plan to launch or evaluating products we have available to customers.\nEmphasize Dialogue over Monologue: Structure your presentation to encourage meaningful two-ways discussions.\nPrepare Targeted Questions: Develop 2-3 specific, through provoking questions to engage members in conversation. These questions should be focused on presentation, strategic decisions GitLab is currently grappling in your stage that you would like to gather customer feedback on, or a question related directly to customer workflows.\nConnect to Previous Feedback: Reference previous feedback you have received from advisory meetings in the past. This will help illustrate to CAB members the value of their time and that GitLab takes their recommendations into consideration.\nPrompt Follow Through: Document key insights and actions items during your session.\nBe Prepared: Be sure to prepare for the meeting ahead of time independently.\nPlease review\nGitLab Product Customer Advisory Board Page\nfor more details.\nWorking with (customer) feature proposals\nWhen someone requests a particular feature, it is the duty of the PM to investigate\nand understand the need for this change. This means you focus on what is the problem\nthat the proposed solution tries to solve. Doing this often allows you to find that:\nAn existing solution already exists within GitLab\nOr: a better or more elegant solution exists\nDo not take a feature request and just implement it.\nIt is your job to find the underlying use case and address that in an elegant way that is orthogonal to existing functionality.\nThis prevents us from building an overly complex application.\nTake this into consideration even when getting feedback or requests from colleagues.\nAs a PM you are ultimately responsible for the quality of the solutions you ship,\nmake sure they‚Äôre the (first iteration of the) best possible solution.\nCompetition channel\nWhen someone posts information in the\n#competition\nchannel that warrants\ncreating an issue and/or a change in\nfeatures.yml\n, follow this\nprocedure:\nCreate a thread on the item by posting\nI'm documenting this\nEither do the following yourself, or\nlink\nto this paragraph for the person picking this up to follow\nIf needed: create an issue\nAdd the item to the\nfeatures.yml\nIf GitLab does not have this feature yet, link to the issue you created\nFinish the thread with a link to the commit and issue\nReaching out to specific users or accounts based on GitLab usage\nYou may want to interview a specific account because they are exhibiting atypical usage patterns or behaviors. In this case,\nrequest Support to contact GitLab.com user(s) on your behalf\n.\nIf it is the weekend, and the contact request is urgent as a result of an action that might affect a users‚Äô usage of GitLab,\npage the CMOC\nAssessing opportunities\nOpportunity canvas\nOne of the primary artifacts of the validation track is the Opportunity Canvas. The Opportunity Canvas introduces a lean product management philosophy to the validation track by quickly iterating on level of confidence, hypotheses, and lessons learned as the document evolves. At completion, it serves as a concise set of knowledge which can be transferred to the relevant issues and epics to aid in understanding user pain, business value, the constraints to a particular problem statement and rationale for prioritization. Just as valuable as a validated Opportunity Canvas is an invalidated one. The tool is also useful for quickly invalidating ideas. A quickly invalidated problem is often\nmore valuable\nthan a slowly validated one.\nPlease note that an opportunity canvas is not required for product functionality or problems that already have well-defined\njobs to be done (JTBD)\n. For situations where we already have a strong understanding of the problem and its solution, it is appropriate to skip the opportunity canvas and proceed directly to solution validation. It might be worth using the opportunity canvas template for existing features in the product to test assumptions and current thinking, although not required.\nReviews\nReviewing opportunity canvases with leadership provides you with an opportunity to get early feedback and alignment on your ideas. To schedule a review:\nContact the CProdO EBA to schedule a 25 minute meeting. Let the EBA know if you are scheduling a comparative or singular Opportunity Review\nThe VCProdO and VP of UX should be included as required attendees.\nThe Product Section Leader, Direct Manager, UX counterpart and Product Operations should be included as optional attendees.\nComplete the Opportunity Canvas(es) at least one business day before the meeting to give attendees an opportunity to review content.¬† The attendees will review the canvas(es) in advance and will add questions directly to the canvas document(s).\nWhen the Opportunity Canvas(es) is complete, inform the meeting participants by tagging them in a post in Slack #product. Include a direct link to the canvases.\nDuring the review, feel free to present anything you‚Äôd like. For comparative reviews it‚Äôs helpful to start with your proposal for which Opportunity to pursue first. For singular reviews it‚Äôs fine to go straight to Q&A since the attendees should have reviewed the canvas in advance.\nReferences\n:\nOpportunity Canvas Template\nCompleted Opportunity Canvas Reviews\nOpportunity Canvas YouTube Playlist\nExample Opportunity Canvas - Fine Grained Access Control (GoogleDoc)\nExample Opportunity Canvas - Error Tracking (Mural)\nOpportunity canvas lite\nOpportunity Canvases are a great assessment for ill-defined or poorly understood problems our customers are experiencing that may result in net new features. As noted previously, opportunity canvases are helpful for existing features, except they are tailored for new feature development which is where the\nProduct-Opportunity-Opportunity-Canvas-Lite\nissue template delivers. This template offers a lightweight approach to quickly identify the customer problem, business case, and feature plan in a convenient issue. The steps to use the template are outlined in the\nInstructions\nsection and for clarity, one would create this issue template for an existing feature they are interested in expanding. For example, this template would be great to use if you are evaluating the opportunity to add a third or fourth iteration to an MVC. This issue should leverage already available resources and be used to collate details to then surface to leadership for review. Once you fill out the template, you will assign to the parties identified in the issue and you can always post in the\n#product\nchannel for visibility.\nAnalyst engagement\nPart of being a product manager at GitLab is maintaining engagement with\nanalysts, culminating in various analyst reports that are applicable to your\nstage. In order to ensure that this is successful and our products are rated\ncorrectly in the analyst scorecards, we follow a few guidelines:\nSpend time checking in with the analysts for your area so they are familiar with our story and features earlier, and so we can get earlier feedback. This will ensure better alignment of the product and the way we talk about it will already be in place when review time comes. Remember, analysts maintain a deep understanding of the markets they cover, and your relationship will be better if it is bi-directional. Inquire with analysts when you have questions about market trends, growth rates, buyer behavior, competitors, or just want to bounce ideas off of an expert.\nMake paying attention to analyst requests a priority, bringing in whoever you need to ensure they are successful. If you have a clear benefit from having executives participate, ask. If you need more resources to ensure something is a success, get them. These reports are not a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù, ad-hoc activity, but an important part of ensuring your product areas are successful.\nWhen responding to the analyst request, challenge yourself to find a way to honestly say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and paint the product in the best light possible. Often, at first glance if we think we don‚Äôt support a feature or capability, with a bit of reflection and thought you can adapt our existing features to solve the problem at hand. This goes much smoother if you follow the first point and spend ongoing time with your analyst partners.\nPerform retrospectives after the analyst report is finalized to ensure we‚Äôre learning from and sharing the results of how we can do better.\nIt‚Äôs important to be closely connected with your product marketing partner,\nsince they own the overall engagement. That said, product has a key role to play\nand should be in the driver‚Äôs seat for putting your stage‚Äôs best foot forward in\nthe responses/discussions.\nEngage with internal customers\nProduct managers should take advantage of the internal customers that their\nstage may have, and use them to better understand what they are really using,\nwhat they need and what they think is important to have in order to replace\nother products and use GitLab for all their flows.\nWe want to meet with our internal customers on a regular basis, setting up\nrecurring calls (e.g., every two weeks) and to invite them to share their\nfeedback.\nThis is a mutual collaboration, so we also want to keep them up to date with the\nnew features that we release, and help them to adopt all our own features.\nUSAT responder outreach\nEach quarter, we reach out to\nUser Satisfaction (USAT)\nsurvey responders who opted-in to speak with us. This is a fantastic opportunity to build bridges with end users and for Product Managers and Product Designers to get direct feedback for their specific product area. If a user has taken the time to share a verbatim with us and offered to have a conversation, they deserve to be followed up with - especially if that user is dissatisfied with GitLab.\nWhen we speak to users directly during this workflow, we must be mindful of\nProduct Legal guidance\nand the\nSAFE framework\n, just as we would be with any other documentation or communication within Product.\nOverall process\nUX Researcher DRI opens a Responder Outreach issue and notifies Product team members in the comments that the issue is ready.\nProduct team members go through the list of USAT responders who have agreed to a follow up conversation. Those team members either sign up for outreach or tag in Product Managers or Product Designers where appropriate.\nProduct team members then view the sheet and confirm who they want to talk with.\nProduct team members reach out to users and schedule interviews.\nProduct team members add notes and video recordings from the interviews to the\ncolumn in this\nDovetail project\n.\nProduct team members mark which users they interviewed, the link to the session recording, and include any additional notes about the session in the follow up users sheet.\nAs Product team members create or continue to work on issues related to USAT follow up interviews, they should the following label (\nUSAT::Responder Outreach\n) to help the UX Research team track the impact of those interviews.\nNote:\nGitLab Customer Success Managers can also follow the process above, so please be mindful to coordinate with them if they reach out or if they‚Äôve already signed up to speak with a user. Users should never be contacted by more than one GitLab team member. Users should never be contacted more than twice if they do not respond to an outreach email.\nInstructions for product leaders\nLook at the\nUSAT Follow Up Users\nGoogle Sheet that will be shared with you in an issue. Identify any users you think a Product Manager or Product Designer from your group would be interested in speaking to. Assign the specific Product Manager or Product Designer to reach out to that user by putting their name in the appropriate column. This will also serve as a ‚Äúhold‚Äù on the user and if others are interested they will need to coordinate with that team member.\nIf you think another Product Manager or Product Designer in your group or another group would be interested in speaking to the same user, consider notifying that team member for the sake of efficiency.\nIf you‚Äôre interested in having one of your Product Managers or Product Designers speak with a user that has already been ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù by another GitLab team member, have your Product Manager or Product Designer reach out to that team member so they can coordinate a joint conversation.\nWe need to be mindful of our users‚Äô time and should limit this outreach to a single conversation rather than successive conversations.\nInstructions for Product Managers and Product Designers\nAnother GitLab team member may put your name next to users they felt were relevant for you to speak with.\nIf you are unable or unwilling to speak with the user, please either remove your name or find a replacement.\nIf you see other users that have not been assigned to another team member and you feel may be relevant to speak with, assign that user to yourself.\nIf you see other users that have been assigned to another team member, reach out to that team member and coordinate a joint conversation. It is very important you do not reach out to users that have been assigned to other team member as we want to be mindful of our users time and not risk negative sentiment due to over-communication. We are limiting these conversations to one per user for these reasons.\nProcess for reaching out to users\nCalendly is the best method for scheduling users.\nSet up your free Calendly account\nif you haven‚Äôt done so. Add details to the invite description describing yourself and the conversation purpose. Also add your personal Zoom link, either via connecting your Zoom account or pasting in your personal Zoom URL.\nYou‚Äôll need to add three extra questions to the invite form in order to ask for consent to record, example below. Please use these questions as written in the example as they closely mirror the content that has been validated by the UX Research Team.\nDraft an email that you‚Äôll send to users. Example copy is below. You can re-phrase things as you wish but make sure you still cover the same points as the example.\nBE ON TIME TO YOUR CALL\n. Better yet, be 2 minutes early. Be ready to coach people through getting Zoom to work properly. Make sure everyone on the call introduces themselves.\nIf people have agreed to recording, still ask them once again if it‚Äôs OK if you record before turning it on. Obviously, do not record people who did not give consent.\nSee our training materials on\nfacilitating user interviews\n.\nExample email copy\n:\nHello,\nMy name is X and I‚Äôm the Product Manager/Designer for X at GitLab. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to follow up on your response to our recent survey.\nI would be very interested in speaking further about some of the points you raised in your survey response. Would you be willing to do a 30 minute Zoom call to give us some more detailed feedback on your experience using GitLab? You‚Äôd be able to schedule the call at a time convenient to you.\nSchedule a time for the call using this link:\nhttps://calendly.com/yourname/30min\nThank you for your feedback and let me know if you have any questions.\nBest,\nYour name\nCopy for three extra questions in Calendly invite\n:\nTo make sure we correctly represent what you say in any followup issues or discussions, we would like to record this conversation. Please indicate if you give permission to record this conversation.\nYes, you may record our conversation.\nNo, you MAY NOT record our conversation.\nAt GitLab, we value transparency. We would love to share the recording of conversation publicly on GitLab. Please indicate whether you give your permission for the recording to be shared on GitLab.\nYes, you may share the recording publicly on GitLab.\nNo, you MAY NOT share the recording publicly on GitLab.\nI agree that by participating in this, and any future, research activities with GitLab, GitLab B.V. will retain all intellectual property rights in any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, or other recommendations I provide which are hereby assigned to GitLab B.V.\nYes\nNo\nAfter the call\nIf multiple GitLab employees are on the call, it can be beneficial to debrief immediately afterwards.\nCollect all notes that were taken and Zoom recording from the interview and add them to the\ncolumn in this\nDovetail project\n.\nIf you told the user you‚Äôd follow up on anything or promised to send them further information, make sure you do so, ideally within two business days.\nGo back to the spreadsheet and mark that you spoke to a user in the\nStatus\ncolumn and add a link to the recording in Dovetail.\nIf you create any epics/issues to address feedback gathered in the calls, add the label\nUSAT::Responder Outreach\nand link them to the corresponding USAT responder outreach issue from that quarter.\nNote: It‚Äôs important to tag your USAT related issues to help tracking/reporting such as the\nimprovement slides\nin Product Key Reviews.\nCost profile and user experience\nEvery Product Manager is responsible for the user experience and cost profile of their product area regardless of how the application is hosted (self-managed or gitlab.com). If a feature is unsustainable from a cost standpoint, that can erode the margins of our SaaS business while driving up the total cost of ownership for self-managed customers. If a feature is slow, it can impact the satisfaction of our users and potentially others on the platform.\nThere are a few questions a Product Manager should ask when thinking about their features:\nWhat are the costs associated with my product area? What is the impact on the margin for each tier of GitLab.com?\nConsider network, compute, and storage costs\nAre there tools in place to help GitLab, Inc and self-managed admins optimize the cost footprint for running GitLab (e.g. node rebalancing, transitioning objects to less costly storage classes, garbage collection capabilities)\nAre there features and default settings that help users stay within their\nCI and Storage limits\n?\nAre there configurable\napplication limits\nin place for admins to enhance the availability and performance of GitLab and reduce\nabuse vectors\n?\nWhat is the experience of users when interacting with these features on GitLab.com? Is it fast and enjoyable?\nThese items do not all need to be implemented in an MVC, though potential costs and application limits should be considered for deployment on GitLab.com.\nProduct Managers should also regularly assess the performance and cost of features and experiences that they are incrementally improving. While the MVC of the feature may be efficient, a few iterations may increase the cost profile.\nTools to understand operational costs\nThere are a few different tools PM‚Äôs can utilize to understand the operational costs of their features. Some of these are maintained by Infrastructure, based on the operational data of GitLab.com. Others tools, like service ping, can be utilized to better understand the costs of our self-managed users. Ultimately, each product group is responsible for ensuring they have the data needed to understand and optimize costs.\nUseful Dashboards to Visualize Infrastructure Costs:\nAccess to Billing Console\n(\nAccess Request\nrequired)\nService ping\nYour Engineering Manager, #infrafin on Slack, and the broader GitLab team\nLinks to learn more about infrastructure cost management initiatives\nInfrafin Board Workflow\nInfrafin Board by Group\nInfrafin Board by Savings Amount\nInfrafin Cost Management Handbook Page\nTools to understand end user experience\nSnowplow data\non GitLab.com\nQuarterly USAT and SUS surveys\nPage load performance\nLife Support PM Expectations\nWhen performing the role of Life Support PM only the following are expected:\nManagement of next three milestones\nAttend group meetings or async discussion channels\nProvide prioritization for upcoming milestones\nMVC definition for upcoming milestones\nIncrease fidelity of scheduled issues via group discussion\nEnsure features delivered by the group are represented in the release post\nSome discouraged responsibilities:\nLong-term MVC definition\nOne year plan\nCategory Strategy updates\nDirection page updates\nAnalyst engagements\nCAB presentations\nBuild vs ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù\nAs a Product Manager you may need to make a decision on whether GitLab should engineer a solution to a particular problem, or use off the shelf software to address the need.\nFirst, consider whether our users share a similar need and if it‚Äôs part of GitLab‚Äôs scope. If so, strongly consider\nbuilding as a feature in GitLab\n:\nEvaluate open source options\nto utilize.\nIf time to market is an issue, a\nglobal optimization issue\nmay also be opened to assist with prioritization.\nFor a potential acquisition, follow the\nacquisition process\n.\nIf the need is specific to GitLab, and will not be built into the product, consider a few guidelines:\nNecessity: Does this\nactually\nneed to be solved now? If not, consider proceeding without and gathering data to make an informed decision later.\nOpportunity cost: Is the need core to GitLab‚Äôs business? Would work on other features return more value to the company and our users?\nCost: How much are off the shelf solutions? How much is it to build, given the expertise in-house and opportunity cost?\nTime to market: Is there time to engineer the solution in-house?\nIf after evaluating these considerations buying a commercial solution is the best path forward:\nConsider\nwho owns the outcome\n, as the spend will be allocated to their department. Get their approval on the proposed plan.\nHave the owning party\nopen a finance issue\nusing the\nvendor_contracts\ntemplate, ensure the justification above is included in the request.\nEvaluating Open Source Software\nWhen considering open source software in build vs. ‚Äúbuy‚Äù decisions we utilize the following general criteria to decide whether to integrate a piece of software:\nCompatibility\n- Does the software utilize a\ncompatible open source license\n?\nViability\n- Is the software, in its current state, viable for the use case in question?\nVelocity\n- Is there a high rate of iteration with the software? Are new features or enhancements proposed and completed quickly? Are security patches applied regularly?\nCommunity\n- Is there a diverse community contributing to the software? Is the software governed by broader communities or by a singular corporate entity? Do maintainers regularly address feedback from the community?\nAnalytics instrumentation guide\nPlease see\nAnalytics Instrumentation Guide\nPost Launch Instrumentation Guide\nGoal:\nIncrease product instrumentation across our offerings to deliver greater product insights. There is a need to retroactively evaluate what features have been instrumented and need instrumentation from past feature launches. Post launch implementation will allow us to gather insights and allow better visibility into feature usage + adoption that may not currently be captured.\nTasks:\nIssue Request\nFollowing the\nProduct Data Insights handbook\n, create an issue focused on instrumentation of products at a category level\nusing the Post-Launch Instrumentation template\n.\nAssign the issue to your Product Data Insights counterpart. Carolyn Braza (\n@cbraza\n) will automatically be added for visibility.\nAlignment\nPM/PDI: Once all stakeholders have been added to the issue, Product Data Insights team will set time with the PM counterpart to align on:\nGoals\nPriorities\nMilestones\nTPgM may assist in implementation of planning documentation.\nCategory Inventory & Instrumentation Mapping\nPM/PDI: Work together to outline a category inventory using\nthis spreadsheet template\n.\nCategory level implementation should be prioritized by most utilized features and the areas we believe have the largest impact on the business.\nFrom there, PM and Product Data Insights counterparts will utilize labels outlined here in step 3 for markers of implementation status.\nThe PM will lead mapping of instrumentation at a category level, in close partnership with the Product Data Insights counterpart.\nFor any metric or event that has been identified to contribute to a categories instrumentation the correct\nproduct_category\nshould be set in the definition file.\nAudit & Review\nPM/PDI: will audit implementation/review implementation to quality check and ensure accuracy async. TPgM may assist in QA.\nUpdate Categories yaml file\nPM: Update the categories.yml file with the applicable implementation status (see below) Utilizing the categories.yml file, the Product Data Insights team will create a Tableau dashboard to track implementation at a category level over time.\nComplete -  Instrumentation complete and satisfactory\nIncomplete - Some instrumentation, but not complete\nNone - No instrumentation - instrumentation needed\nNot needed - Instrumentation not needed\nAnalytics Instrumentation\nPM/PDI: Once category instrumentation audit has been completed. For categories marked as either red (needing implementation) or yellow (some instrumentation, not complete),\nPM/EM: will create an instrumentation issue with the label\nanalytics instrumentation\nand utilizing the\nusage data instrumentation template\n.\nPage load performance metrics\nIn order to better understand the perceived performance of GitLab, there is a synthetic page load performance testing framework available based on\nsitespeed.io\n.\nGrafana dashboard\nis available for each stage, tracking the\nLargest Contentful Paint\nand first/last visual change times. These metrics together provide high-level insight into the experience our users have when interacting with these pages.\nAdding additional pages to performance testing\nThe Grafana dashboards are managed using\ngrafonnet\n, making it easy to add additional pages and charts.\nTesting a new set of pages requires just 2 steps:\nAdd the desired URL‚Äôs to the sitespeed\nunauthenticated\nor\nauthenticated\ntesting list. Add a new line with the URL, then a space, and an alias of the form\n[Group]_[Feature]_[Detail]\n. The alias needs to be one word, an example MR is\nhere\n. Note the authenticated user account does not have any special permissions, it is simply logged in.\nOpen the relevant stage‚Äôs\ngrafonnet dashboard file\n. Find the section corresponding to the desired group, and add an additional call to\nproductCommon.pageDetail\n. The call arguments are\nChart Title\n,\nAlias\nfrom above, and the tested\n. Ensure the JSON formatting is correct, the easiest way is to simply copy/paste from another line. A sample MR is available\nhere\n.\nAssign both MR‚Äôs to a maintainer. After they are merged, the stage‚Äôs Grafana dashboard will be automatically updated.

Whether you‚Äôre creating something new or improving something that already exists, we want you to feel empowered to bring your best ideas for influencing the product direction through improved scalability, usability, resilience, and system architectures. And when you feel like you need to expand your knowledge in a particular area, know that you‚Äôre supported in having the resources to learn and improve your skills.\nOur focus is to make sure that GitLab is enterprise grade in all its abilities and to support the AI efforts required to successfully launch AI features to General Availability.\nMaking sure that GitLab is enterprise grade involves several teams collaborating on improving our disaster recovery and support offerings through ongoing work with GitLab Dedicated and Cells infrastructure. Our goal here is improved availability and service recovery.\nEngineering Culture\nEngineering culture at GitLab encompasses the processes, workflows, principles\nand priorities that all stem from our\n.\nAll these things continuously strengthen our engineering craftsmanship and\nallow engineers to achieve engineering excellence, while growing and having a\nsignificant, positive impact on the product, people, and the company as a whole.\nOur engineering culture is primarily being carried and evolves through\nknowledge sharing and collaboration. Everyone can be part of this process\nbecause at GitLab everyone can contribute.\nEngineering Excellence\nEngineering excellence can be defined as an intrinsic motivation to improve\nengineering efficiency, software quality, and deliver better results while\nbuilding software products. Engineering excellence is being fueled by a strong\nengineering culture combined with a mission: to build better software that\nallows everyone to contribute.\nEngineering Initiatives\nEngineering is the primary advocate for the performance, availability, and security of the GitLab project. Product Management prioritizes 60% of engineering time, so everyone in the engineering function should participate in the Product Management\nprioritization process\nto ensure that our project stays ahead in these areas. Engineering prioritizes 40% of time on initiatives that improve the product, underlying platform, and foundational technologies we use.\nWork in the 40% time budget should be coordinated and prioritized by the Engineering Manager of a team. Use the label\nEngineering Time\nfor issues and MRs that are done as part of it so we can follow the work and the results across the engineering division.\nContributing to broad engineering initiatives and participating in working group-related tasks.\nReview fixes from our support team. These merge requests are tagged with the\nSupport Team Contributions\nlabel. You can\nfilter on open MRs\n.\nWorking on high priority issues as a result of\nissue triaging\n. This is our commitment to the community and we need to include some capacity to review MRs or work on defects raised by the community.\nImprovements to the performance, stability and scalability of a feature or dependency including underlying infrastructure. Again, the Product team should be involved in the definition of these issues but Engineering may lead here by planning, prioritizing, and coordinating the recommended improvements.\nImprovements and upgrades to our toolchain in order to boost efficiency.\nCodebase improvements: Removing technical debt, updating or replacing outdated dependencies, and enhancing logging and monitoring capabilities.\nConstructing Proof-of-Concept models for thorough exploration of new technologies, enhancements and new possibilites.\nWork on improvements and feature enhancements to the product, in the sense of internal community contributions, that would increase our internal engineering productivity by focusing on ready-to-go items that are currently assigned a low priority in the backlog.\nEngineering Innovation\nEngineering Innovation is a new process geared toward individual or small-team collaboration that encourages engineers to explore new ideas and Proof-of-Concepts. These projects are typically lean, time-boxed, iterative, and designed to validate whether an idea has the potential to evolve into a viable experimental feature or product.  See the\nInnovation at GitLab Guide\n.\nTechnical Roadmaps\nSome of the above examples for the 40% time budget can help in forming a long-term technical roadmap for your group, and determine how best to prioritize your technical work to support overall business goals. In addition to the examples above:\nAsk yourself these questions\nWhat are your most frequent sources of delays? (Could be long-standing tech debt you have to work past while developing, could be lack of reviewers for your domain, could be external to your team like with pipeline duration)\nDo you have any consistently similar bugs or security issues that come in due to a certain area?\nHas your team been talking about potentially refactoring any areas?\nIs your team struggling with certain processes?\nHave you had recent incidents that allude to a larger problem?\nAre you getting frequent requests for help in some area?\nIs your team frequently missing their deliverable commitments? What would help?\nDoes your area have performance (slow endpoints, inconsistent responses, intermittent errors) or scalability (the feature or area as-is will not scale) concerns?\nWhere do you see the biggest instability? Have you talked to operations and support about feedback for  your area?\nDo you have application or rate limits in the right places?\nHave you burned down your security, corrective action, and infradev issues?\nIs your error budget green?\nHave your feature flags been removed from the codebase yet?\nDo you have adequate unit test, integration test and E2E coverage?\nDo you have adequate documentation for your features?\nDo you have adequate telemetry , logging, monitoring of your features?\nDo you have adequate error handling and error codes that allows fast and easy diagnostics?\nGather data like this\nMaster:Broken issues\n~‚Äúseverity::1‚Äù and ~‚Äúseverity::2‚Äù  bugs\nMissed-Slo issues\nFlaky test issues\n~‚Äútype::maintenance‚Äù issues\nThink about the future state of your product\nWhere do you want your product to be this time next year?\nWhat are the technical requirements to achieve that?\nWhat are technical topics that would benefit from research/POCs?\nWhat would make it easier for you to achieve that if it was no longer a factor?\nWhat would be the performance and/or business impact once you address these issues?\nHow would you evolve your team processes to regularly review your technical roadmap?\nTechnical roadmap process\nEngineering Managers (EMs) are responsible for collaboratively developing their team‚Äôs technical roadmap backlog. All items should be documented as epics and issues using the ‚ÄúTechnical Roadmap‚Äù label.\nGlobal initiatives will be defined and must be incorporated into each group‚Äôs roadmap and prioritization (e.g., allocating 40% of front-end capacity for Vue upgrade, completing all Cells issues for a specific area by milestone XYZ).\nPrioritization of items should align with:\nGeneral business goals\nEngineering vision\nTeam capacity and expertise\nPlanning Guidelines:\nAllocate 40% of the overall time budget for technical roadmap items in the normal milestone planning process.\nUse the ‚ÄúTechnical roadmap‚Äù label for all related issues to facilitate tracking and coordination.\nKey Steps:\nIdentify and document technical debt and improvement opportunities\nAssess impact and effort for each item\nPrioritize based on business value and strategic alignment\nIntegrate with existing iteration/milestone planning\nRegularly review and adjust the roadmap\nThis process ensures a balanced approach between feature development and technical improvements, promoting long-term sustainability and efficiency of the engineering organization.\nCommunity Contributions\nWe have a 3-year goal of\nreaching 1,000 monthly contributors\nas a way to mature new stages, add customer-desired features that aren‚Äôt on our roadmap, and even translate our product into multiple languages.\nDiversity\nDiverse teams perform better\n. They provide a sense of belonging that leads to higher levels of trust, better decision making, and a larger talent pool.\nThey also focus more on facts, process facts more carefully, and are more innovative\n. By hiring globally and increasing the numbers of women and under represented groups (URGs) in the Engineering division, we‚Äôre helping everyone bring their best selves to work.\nGrowing our team\nStrategic hiring is a top priority, and we‚Äôre excited to continue hiring people who are passionate about our product and have the skills to make it the best DevSecOps tool in the market. Our current focus areas include reducing the amount of time between offer and start dates and hiring a diverse team (see\nabove\n). We‚Äôre also implementing industry-standard approaches like structured, behavioral, and situational interviewing to help ensure a consistent interview process that helps to identify the best candidate for every role. We‚Äôre excited to have a recruiting org to partner with as we balance the time that managers spend recruiting against the time they spend investing in their current team members.\nExpand customer focus through depth and stability\nAs expected, a large part of our focus is on improving our product.\nFor\nEnterprise customers\n, we‚Äôre refining our product to meet the levels of security and reliability that customers rightfully demand from SaaS platforms\n(SaaS Reliability)\n. We‚Äôre also providing more robust utilization metrics to help them discover features relevant to their own DevOps transformations\n(Usage Reporting)\nand offering the ability to purchase and manage licenses without spending time contacting Sales or Support\n(E-Commerce and Cloud Licensing)\n. Lastly, in response to Enterprise customer requests, we‚Äôre adding features to support Suggested Reviewers, better portfolio management through Work Items, and Audit Events that provide additional visibility into user passive actions.\nFor\nFree Users\n, we‚Äôre becoming more efficient with our open core offering, so that we can continue to support and give back to students, startups, educational institutions, open source projects, GitLab contributors, and nonprofits.\nFor\nFederal Agencies\n, we‚Äôre obtaining FedRAMP certification to strengthen confidence in the security standards required on our SaaS offering. This is a mandated prerequisite for United States federal agencies to use our product.\nFor\nHosted Customers\n, we‚Äôre supporting feature parity between Self-Managed and GitLab Hosted environments through the Workspace initiative. We‚Äôre also launching GitLab Dedicated for customers who want the flexibility of cloud with the security and performance of a single-tenant environment.\nFor customers using\n, we‚Äôre expanding the available types of Runners to include macOS, Linux/Docker, and Windows, and we‚Äôre autoscaling build agents.\nTaking time off\nNote:\nThis process is expected for PTO that is five consecutive days or more, inclusive of adjacent public holidays (excluding weekend days). For PTO that is fewer than five consecutive days, including the cases where there are multiple PTO blocks with fewer than 5 consecutive days and a few working days in-between, a coverage issue is not required but a coverage issue can be filed for PTO of any length, especially if it‚Äôd be helpful to balance team continuity and individual flexibility.\nIn order to ensure business continuity, and deliver on commitments; the Engineering Division is adopting a PTO Coverage Issue Process. Processes like this are already formalized in GitLab (e.g.\nPM Coverage Issue\n) and some team‚Äôs within Engineering have practiced this regularly at the Management+ level. This allows us to continue to support team member well-being through time away without negatively impacting the rest of the team.\nA PTO Coverage issue is required for\njob grades 8 and up\n. For job grades 7 and below a PTO Coverage issue is recommended as there is value in going through the process of creating the PTO Coverage issue even if there are minimal items to include (for all levels) in that it forces you to think about what you have on your plate and what impact your PTO will have on those items. So whether the result is that the work waits or there is someone designated as a replacement DRI, it makes the decision explicit and documented.\nOnce planning for a milestone has been completed (see\nMonday, 5 days before the milestone begins\n) PTO for periods longer than 5 consecutive days, inclusive of adjacent public holidays (excluding weekend days), cannot be requested. This is to prevent disrupting plans for that milestone. There are exceptions to this, but all need to be discussed with your manager. Examples include:\nurgent scenarios\na team/individual hits targets earlier in the milestone (\nwe measure impact, not activity\n)\na strong need for a team member to take PTO of this length\nThese issues will help inform teams as they plan their milestones to ensure the work teams are committed to can be achieved with the staff available, or if there will be a lack of staff to achieve those commitments, to work with team members to see what can be done to achieve the results for our customers.\nThe process below helps to clarify and expand upon the\nFlexible PTO Policy\nby making the coordination with the team members manager explicit.\n1. Creating an Engineering coverage issue\nYou should use\nthis issue template\nto define handshake responsibilities. For extended leave, it is important to find one or more Directly Responsible Individuals (DRIs) that will be able to make decisions while you are away. This may be your manager, another engineer, or maybe the Product Manager for your team. The coverage issue should contain all the necessary information for the DRIs to make good decisions in your absence, so please make sure to include as much detail as needed. The coverage issue should highlight work impact estimates, mitigations identified, and coverage alternatives.\nIf additional context needs to be shared to provide color to the coverage issue, you can consider a specific handover meeting to cover further details.\nIt is recommended to work with your manager and other stakeholders when considering cross-functional teammate capacity for a coverage task assignment. For example, while it‚Äôs optimal for PM, EM, and PDs to assist in covering for each other given their shared knowledge of their product area including customers and users, PM teammates may or may not have the bandwidth or expertise to take on covering engineering specific responsibilities. Alternatively, it may be better for the manager of the engineer or another engineer in the same stage to aid in coverage. Plan to have the necessary conversations across teams and managers.\n2. Sharing your Engineering coverage issue with your manager\nOnce you‚Äôve filed your engineering coverage issue, share this with your manager prior to milestone planning so they can review and approve. Check the\nlatest guidance in our PTO policy\non how much notice is required.\nConsider whether any new commitments would be affected by your planned PTO. If a team member falls behind on something, they will need to make sure they have a coverage plan in place to ensure success of their commitments.\n3. Manager reviews coverage issue\nOnce the team member has shared their coverage issue with their manager, the manager will review the coverage issue and validate assumptions with stakeholders or impacted project DRIs as needed.\nThe manager will make a decision on approval or discuss different arrangements or other contingency plans. Once the manager ticks their box on the coverage issue approving the leave, enter the time off into Workday.\n4. Communicate your time off\nAfter team members‚Äô coverage issue is approved, team members will\ncommunicate their time off\nand enter the PTO into Deel/Workday including a link to their coverage issue. Team members will share their coverage issue with their relevant colleagues via Slack channels, GitLab status, etc. ahead of the milestone planning.\n5. Take your time off\nPlease disconnect and take the time off that you need!\n6. Returning from Time Off\nReturning from time off can be overwhelming and daunting. You should work with your DRIs to understand what has changed during your absence and what the current priorities are. Also, communicate transparently that your response time may be slower because you are catching up. Here are some additional tips on\nhow to return back to work after time off\n.\nEngineering Departments\nThere are five departments within the Engineering Division:\nDevOps Engineering Department\nAI Engineering Department\nSec Department\nInfrastructure Platforms\nSupport Engineering Department\nOther Related Pages\nCTO Leadership Team\nCommunication\nDatabase Engineering\nDevelopment Principles\nEngineering Automation\nEngineering Metrics\nEngineering READMEs\nFrequently Used Projects\nGitLab Innovation Program\n, managed by the GitLab Legal Team\nHiring\nMentorship\nPajamas Design System\nR&D Tax Credit Applications\nWorkflows\nDeveloper onboarding\nEngineering Demo Process\nEngineering Workflow\nCode Review\nSecurity Issues\nArchitecture Design\nGitLab Repositories\nIssue Triage Policies\nContributing to Go projects\nWider Community Merge Request Triage Policies\nRoot Cause Analysis\nUnplanned Critical Patch releases\nIncident Management\nGitLab in Production\nWorkflow Diagram\nError Budgets\nPerformance of GitLab\nMonitoring of GitLab.com\nProduction Readiness Guide\nPeople Management\nEngineering Career Development\nEngineering Career Mobility Principles\nEmerging Talent @ GitLab\nEngineering Management\nCross-Functional Prioritization\nSee the\nCross-Functional Prioritization page\nfor more information.\nSaaS Availability Weekly Standup\nTo maintain high availability, Engineering runs a weekly SaaS Availability standup to:\nReview high severity (S1/S2) public facing incidents\nReview important SaaS metrics\nTrack progress of Corrective Actions\nTrack progress of Feature Change Locks\nInfrastructure Items\nEach week the Infrastructure team reports on incidents and key metrics. Updating these items at the top of the\nEngineering Allocation Meeting Agenda\nis the responsibility of the Engineering Manager for the\nGeneral Squad\nin Reliability.\nIncident Review\nInclude any\nS1 incidents\nthat have occurred since the previous meeting.\nInclude any incidents that required a\nstatus page\nupdate.\nSaaS Metrics Review\nInclude screenshots of the following graphs in the\nagenda\n.\nAlert Volume Review\nCorrective Actions\nDevelopment Items\nFor the core and expansion development departments, updates on current status of:\nError budgets\nReliability issues (infradev)\nSecurity issues\nGroups under Feature Change Locks should update progress synchronously or asynchronously in the weekly agenda.\nThe intention of this meeting is to communicate progress and to evaluate and prioritise escalations from infrastructure.\nFeature Change Locks progress reports should appear in the following format in the weekly agenda:\nFCL xxxx - [team name]\nFCL planning issue:\n<issue link>\nIncident Issue:\n<issue link>\nIncident Review Issue:\n<issue link>\nIncident Timeline:\n<link to Timeline tab of the Incident issue>\ne.g. time to detection, time to initiate/complete rollback (as applicable), time to mitigation\nCause of Incident\nMitigation\nStatus of Planned/completed work associated with FCL\nFeature Change Locks\nA Feature Change Lock (FCL) is a process to improve the reliability and availability of GitLab.com. We will enact an FCL anytime there is an S1 or public-facing (status page) S2 incident on GitLab.com (including the License App, CustomersDot, and Versions) determined to be caused by an engineering department change. The\nteam\ninvolved should be determined by the author, their line manager, and that manager‚Äôs other direct reports.\nIf the incident meets the above criteria, then the manager of the team is responsible for:\nForm the group of engineers working under the FCL. By default, it will be the whole team, but it could be a reduced group if there is not enough work for everyone.\nPlan and execute the FCL.\nInform their manager (e.g. Senior Manager / Director) that the team will focus efforts towards an FCL.\nProvides updates at the\nSaaS Availability Weekly Standup\n.\nIf the team believes there does not need to be an FCL, approval must be obtained from either the VP of Infrastructure or VP of Development.\nDirect reports involved in an active\nborrow\nshould be included if they were involved in the authorship or review of the change.\nThe purpose is to foster a sense of ownership and accountability amongst our teams, but this should not challenge our no-blame culture.\nTimeline\nRough guidance on timeline is provided here to set expectations and urgency for an FCL.  We want to balance moving urgently with doing thoughtful important work to improve reliability.  Note that as times shift we can adjust accordingly.   The DRI of an FCL should pull in the timeline where possible.\nThe following bulleted list provides a suggested timeline starting from incident to completion of the FCL.  ‚ÄúBusiness day x‚Äù in this case refers to the x business day after the incident.\nDay 0: Incident:\nBusiness day 1:  relevant Engineering Director collaborates with VP of Development and/or VP of Infrastructure or their designee to establish if FCL is required.\nBusiness day 2:  confirmation that an FCL is required for this incident and start planning.\nBusiness days 3-4:  planning time\nBusiness days 5-9 (1 week):  complete planned work\nBusiness days 10-11:  closing ceremony, retrospective and report back to standup\nActivities\nDuring the FCL, the team(s) exclusive focus is around\nreliability work\n, and any feature type of work in-flight has to be paused or re-assigned. Maintainer duties can still be done during this period and should keep other teams moving forward. Explicitly higher priority work such as security and data loss prevention should continue as well. The team(s) must:\nCreate a public slack channel called\n#fcl-incident-[number]\n, with members\nThe Team‚Äôs Manager\nThe Author and their teammates\nThe Product Manager, the stage‚Äôs Product leader, and the section‚Äôs Product leader\nAll reviewer(s)\nAll maintainers(s)\nInfrastructure Stable counterpart\nThe chain-of-command from the manager to the VP (Sr Manager, Sr/Director, VP, etc)\nCreate an\nFCL issue\nin the\nFCL Project\nwith the information below in the description:\nName the issue:\n[Group Name] FCL for Incident ####\nLinks to the incident, original change, and slack channel\nFCL Timeline\nList of work items\nComplete the written Incident Review documentation within the Incident Issue as the first priority after the incident is resolved.  The Incident Review must include completing all fields in the Incident Review section of the incident issue (see\nincident issue template\n).  The incident issue should serve as the single source of truth for this information, unless a linked confidential issue is required. Completing it should create a common understanding of the problem space and set a shared direction for the work that needs to be completed.\nSee that not only all procedures were followed but also how improvements to procedures could have prevented it\nA work plan referencing all the Issues, Epics, and/or involved MRs must be created and used to identify the scope of work for the FCL. The work plan itself should be an Issue or Epic.\nDaily - add an update comment in your FCL issue or epic using the template:\nExec-level summary\nTarget End Date\nHighlights/lowlights\nAdd an agenda item in the\nSaaS Availability weekly standup\nand summarize status each week that the FCL remains open.\nHold a synchronous\nclosing ceremony\nupon completing the FCL to review the retrospectives and celebrate the learnings.\nAll FCL stakeholders and participants shall attend or participate async.  Managers of the groups participating in the FCL, including Sr. EMs and Directors should be invited.\nAgenda includes reviewing FCL retrospective notes and sharing learnings about improving code change quality and reducing risk of availability.\nOutcome includes\nhandbook\nand\nGitLab Docs\nupdates where applicable.\nScope of work during FCL\nAfter the Incident Review is completed, the team(s) focus is on preventing similar problems from recurring and improving detection. This should include, but is not limited to:\nAddress immediate corrective actions to prevent incident reoccurrence in the short term\nIntroduce changes to reduce incident detection time (improve collected metrics, service level monitoring, which users are impacted)\nIntroduce changes to reduce mitigation time (improve rollout process through feature flags, and clean rollbacks)\nEnsure that the incident is reproducible in environments outside of production (Detect issues in staging, increase end-to-end integration test coverage)\nImprove development test coverage to detect problems (Harden unit testing, make it simpler to detect problems during reviews)\nCreate issues with general process improvements or asks for other teams\nExamples of this work include, but are not limited to:\nFixing items from the Incident Review which are identified as causal or contributing to the incident.\nImproving observability\nImproving unit test coverage\nAdding integration tests\nImproving service level monitoring\nImproving symmetry of pre-production environments\nImproving the\nGitLab Performance Tool\nAdding mock data to tests or environments\nMaking process improvements\nPopulating their backlog with further reliability work\nSecurity work\nImprove communication and workflows with other teams or counterparts\nAny work for the specific team kicked off during this period must be completed, even if it takes longer than the duration of the FCL. Any work directly related to the incident should be kicked off and completed even if the FCL is over. Work paused due to the FCL should be the priority to resume after the FCL is over. Items created for other teams or on a global level don‚Äôt affect the end of the FCL.\nA stable counterpart from Infrastructure will be available to review and consult on the work plan for Development Department FCLs. Infrastructure FCLs will be evaluated by an Infrastructure Director.\nEngineering Performance Indicator process\nThe\nProduct Analytics team\nis responsible for maintaining Engineering Performance Indicators. Work regarding KPI / RPI is tracked using the\nProduct Analytics task intake tracker\n.\nManual verification\nWe manually verify that our code works as expected.\nAutomated test coverage is essential,\nbut manual verification provides a higher level of confidence that features behave as intended and bugs are fixed.\nWe manually verify issues when they are in the\nworkflow::verification\nstate.\nGenerally, after you have manually verified something, you can close the associated issue.\nSee the\nProduct Development Flow\nto learn more about this issue state.\nWe manually verify in the staging environment whenever possible.\nIn certain cases we may need to manually verify in the production environment.\nIf you need to test features that are built for GitLab Ultimate then you can get added to the\nissue-reproduce\ngroup on production and staging environments by asking in the\n#development\nSlack channel.\nThese groups are on an Ultimate plan.\nCritical Customer Escalations\nWe follow the below process when existing\ncritical customer escalations\nrequires immediate scheduling of bug fixes or development effort.\nRequirements for critical escalation\nCustomer is in\ncritical escalation\nstate\nThe issues escalated have critical business impact to the customer, determined by Customer Success and Support Engineering leadership\nFailure to expedite scheduling may have cascading business impact to GitLab\nApproval from a VP from Customer Success AND a Director of Support Engineering are required to expedite scheduling\nCustomer Success: approval from VP, Customer Success Management -\nSherrod Patching\nSupport Engineering: approval from VP, Support -\nJohnny Scarborough\nProcess\nThe issue priority is set to\n~\"priority::1\"\nregardless of severity\nThe label\n~\"critical-customer-escalation\"\nis applied to the issue\nThe issue is scheduled within 1 business day\nFor issues of type features, approval from the Product DRI is needed.\nThe DRI or their delegate provides daily process updates in the escalated customer slack channel\nIf issue is type bug DRI is the Director of Development\nIf issue is type feature DRI is the Director of Product\nIf issue requires Infrastructure work the DRI is the Engineering Manager in Infrastructure\nThe DRI can use the\ncustomer critical merge requests\nprocess to expedite code review & merge.\nPairing Engineers on priority::1/severity::1 Issues\nIn most cases, a single engineer and maintainer review are adequate to handle a priority::1/severity::1 issue. However, some issues are highly difficult or complicated. Engineers should treat these issues with a high sense of urgency. For a complicated priority::1/severity::1 issue, multiple engineers should be assigned based on the level of complexity. The issue description should include the team member and their responsibilities.\nTeam Member\nResponsibility\nTeam Member 1\nReproduce the Problem\nTeam Member 2\nAudit Code Base for other places where this may occur\nIf we have cases where three or five or X people are needed, Engineering Managers should feel the freedom to execute on a plan quickly.\nFollowing this procedure will:\nDecrease the time it takes to resolve priority::1/severity::1 issues\nAllow for a smooth handover of the issue in case of OOO or End of the Work Day\nProvide support for Engineers if they are stuck on a problem\nProvide another set of eyes on topics with high urgency or securing security-related fixes\nInternal Engineering handbook\nThere are some engineering handbook topics that are\ninternal only\n.

If this is desired in a specific quarter, at least a month before the dinner, the CoS to the CEO will gather nominations and ensure that E-Group has identified an invitee. Criteria for consideration includes:\nKey Talent\nHigh performance\nClear results\nFunction (should have representation across functions throughout the year)\nDiversity (participation from members in\nGitLab Team Member Resource Groups\n)\nOnce the Key Talent Guest has been identified, it is the relevant E-Group team member‚Äôs responsibility to ensure that managers of this person are aware of the invite. The EBA to the CEO will then confirm that the guest is able to join. If not, the invite will go to the runner up. Once a Key Talent Guest is confirmed, the EBA to the CEO should enter their name in the\nKey Talent Board Dinner Guests\n.\nGitLab will cover this person‚Äôs travel expenses. A person‚Äôs location will not be considered in the selection criteria though the person‚Äôs travel must be allowed under GitLab‚Äôs\ntravel policies and guidelines\n.\nAs part of joining the dinner, the Key Talent Guest should come prepared to discuss:\nTheir background (both at GitLab and before joining)\nWhat they have accomplished thus far at GitLab\nWhat their plans are both now and in the future and what they see as a future for themselves at GitLab\nThough no formal presentation is required, the Key Talent Guest should advise on how they want to discuss these topics with the Board and E-Group and coordinate with the EBA to the CEO. The EBA to the CEO will ensure that the Key Talent Guest has dedicated time at the dinner.\nKey Talent Board Dinner Guests\nPast and future Key Talent Dinner Guests are listed below.\nDate\nKey Talent Guest\n2021-09-29\nDavid DeSanto\n2021-12-13\nSherrod Patching\n2022-03-21\nChristine Lee\n2022-12-12\nSherida McMullan\nQuarterly AMA with the Board\nBoard Selection Process\nRoles and Responsibilities\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n- Collaborate on Board evolution.

When\neveryone can contribute\n, users become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of innovation.\nAs a Talent Acquisition team, we have an outsized impact on GitLab‚Äôs ability to make this mission a reality, by connecting top talent to profound careers from wherever they are in a truly distributed, remote workforce.\nTalent Acquisition Vision Statement\nTo create globally inclusive access to opportunities so that\neveryone can contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world\n.\nTalent Acquisition Mission Statement\nIt is the Talent Acquisition Team‚Äôs mission to predictably build distributed, representative teams that enable team members to\nco-create\nthe future of software.\nOur Guiding Principles\nAs we set out to achieve this vision, we will continue to rely on core guiding principles to define how we build toward the future.\nExperience\n: Stakeholder experience is central to our craft. We are a partner, an advisor, and an essential component to building high performing teams and culture at GitLab.\nInclusivity\n: We design fair and equitable processes into the fabric of what we do. We believe Talent Acquisition has an outsized impact on the make-up of our teams, and we strive to continue to build them with inclusivity as a integral piece of our craft.\nPredictability\n: Our ability to have the right team members, in the right roles, at the right time is imperative to execute on our commitments and plans as an organization. We strive for predictability: to build accuracy in our forecasts and enable the business to look around corners through strong relationships and data driven decision making.\nOur Objectives and Roadmap\nWe strive to be as transparent as possible, but these sections are only available for our GitLab team members.\nTalent Acquisition Strategy\nTalent Acquisition Pages and Processes\nTeam Process Pages\nTalent Acquisition Productivity\nTalent Acquisition Alignment\nTriad Process\nQuarterly Updates\nNote: Internal only\nShared Definitions\nJob:\nA job refers to the job title (ex: Customer Support Specialist). This will also be what appears on external job boards. In the case there are multiple positions open that are the same, and we only want to list once, we can have multiple ‚Äòopenings‚Äô (see next section) opened within one ‚ÄòJob‚Äô. Each job will have a unique identifier called a Requisition ID (example- 1001).\nOpening:\nA job can have multiple openings attached to it (ex: you are hiring 3 Customer Support Specialists. You would then have 1 ‚ÄòJob‚Äô and 3 ‚Äòopenings‚Äô against that job). A job can have multiple openings against it, but an opening can not be associated with multiple jobs. Each opening will have a unique identifier called an Opening ID (example- 1001-1, 1001-2, 1001-3).\nGHPiD:\nGHP ID is the link between Adaptive (what we use to track our operating plan) and Greenhouse (our ATS). A GHP ID has a one to one relationship with an Opening ID. It is the key interlock between our hiring plans and our Talent Acquisition activity. This is a custom field in Greenhouse.\nTeam Playbooks\nRecruiter Playbook\nHiring Manager Playbook (coming soon)\nInterviewer Playbook (coming soon)\nCandidate Handbook Pages\nPlease find pages for potential and active applicants below.\nCandidate Handbook Page\nTalent Acquisition Privacy Policy\nInterviewer Processes\nInterviewer Prep Requirements\nConducting a GitLab Interview\nGreenhouse for Interviewers\nHiring Manager Processes\nConducting a GitLab Interview\nGreenhouse for Hiring Managers\nCandidate Experience Specialist Processes\nCandidate Experience Specialist Responsibilities\nModernLoop\nHow to Complete a Contract - CES Process\nRecruiters and Sourcers\nOpening a job\nGet your headcount assignments\nHow to open headcount on R&D\nHow to open headcount on Sales and G&A\nOpen a req in Greenhouse\nInstructions here\nOpen a kickoff session\nEvergreen requisitions\nCreating an evergreen req\nEvergreen req guide\nAn Evergreen Job is a requisition that is ‚Äòalways open‚Äô. More specifically, it is used when we have at least 3 openings for a particular job repeated each quarter. There is then one Evergreen job posted for internal, external and passive candidates. It is important that no candidate is hired to an Evergreen job, and instead is moved to an approved opening (aka an opening with a single corresponding GHPiD). TA Leadership will open EVG roles at the start of a fiscal year, with a quarterly review cadence, by leveraging the hiring plan and attrition assumptions. See the pages above for more information.\nTips and Tricks\nKnow your department before you open your req. If you need to change the department name later, the approval chain will not automatically update. If this happens to you, please contact Enablement.\nWe do not re-open jobs after they have been closed. This is because permissions and approvers may have changed in the time since the job was first closed.\nPost a job in Greenhouse\nPost an\ninternal\njob\nPost an\nexternal\njob\nUsing Rules\nAuto-tags\nTips and Tricks\nSalary transparency: In select US states, GitLab discloses salaries in job descriptions in accordance with local laws. Total Rewards will add this information to the job‚Äôs approvals page. When you create your\nexternal\njob post, utilize Pay Transparency Rules and select Hiring in the USA. If the job will not be posted in the US, select N/A.\nEEOC questions should be checked off in the US only\nClick here\nfor more information on selecting the correct location for your job. This will help ensure that your LinkedIn listings are posted in the correct countries.\nOur jobs are now set up to automatically go to Indeed and Glassdoor and be posted as remote roles on both sites. Recruiters should unselect or leave unselected the option in Greenhouse to ‚Äúpublish to free job boards‚Äù as this requires us to input city, state, and country data that overrides the remote job listing. There is an automation in place to automatically send jobs to Indeed and Glassdoor.\nReq access and permissions\nAs a member of the Talent Acquisition team, you have the ability to add team members to view your job with differing layers of access. By default, all team members can access the interview kit & scorecard of someone they‚Äôre interviewing and this access does not need to be granted. For team members who require additional access, such as a Hiring Manager or their EBA, you will need to grant that access where appropriate. You can use\nthis guide\nto help determine the appropriate access.\nAs you are deciding what access level someone should have, default to the setting that allows the most confidentiality for a candidate. If a team member does not need access to scorecards, for example, we should be choosing an access level that does not allow them to see them. A job admin (someone with higher level permissions) typically should not be at the same level or a direct report of a job they have access to. Recruiters typically grant only Hiring Manager access - interviewers do not need special access and cannot access scorecards or candidate profiles through Greenhouse.\nTo add or remove access in a job, go to ‚Äòjob setup‚Äô and click ‚Äòhiring team‚Äô. Add or remove access under ‚ÄúWho can see this job?‚Äù. Unfortunately, there is no way to bulk add or remove access. You can also add and remove access when creating your job from a template. If you are searching for a team member and cannot find their name, ensure that you do not have filters activated.\nDo not grant admin access through templates,\nbecause this could create problems in the future.\nSet up scorecards and interview plans\nThere are two elements of a scorecard: the Scorecard section and the Interview Plan section. Both are accessible through Job Setup.\nScorecard\nDepending on your department, you may have a lot of your scorecard options pre-filled. R&D scorecards are always set up for you, and may only require small tweaks depending on technical language or job grade.\nInterview Plan\nTips and Tricks\nName your interviews in a way that will help your Candidate Experience Specialist partner schedule your interview. We recommend ‚ÄòTopic -  Interviewer - Time‚Äô i.e. ‚ÄòValues Interview - Beyonce Knowles - 45 min‚Äô. If you are pulling from a large interviewer pool, you can discuss with your Candidate Experience Specialist partner if it makes sense to create a Prelude interviewer pool that will help with scheduling.\nOnce you have set up the stages and interview names, add the specific interview questions asked into the ‚ÄúInterview Questions‚Äù section of the Interview Plan.\nIf you need to make bulk changes to a large number of jobs‚Äô scorecards at once, Enablement has the ability to make bulk changes. Please contact them for assistance.\nRecruiters don‚Äôt need to be the only ones adding interview questions to the interview plan. Invite your Hiring Manager to complete this task alongside you.\nInterview Stages\nStages Overview\nPlease note that the names of stages is important, and we should only have stages with the names listed below. Anything outside of these stages will not appear on reporting.\nScorecards are required in all stages that require interviews. Confidential, personal information and disclosures about being part of a protected class are never to be written in scorecards. Recruiters can add salary information into Private Notes outside of the scorecard to maintain confidentiality.\nGet to Know Us:\nThis is an application review stage.\nQualified:\nThis is the stage where positive applications will be triaged. Candidates can wait here to be scheduled for interviews, to ensure the right mix of well-qualified candidates are screened at the right times.\nScreening:\nPhone or video interview with a recruiter, scheduled through Calendly.\nAssessment:\nThis is an optional stage where written assignments can be submitted. Learn more\nhere\n.\nInitial Interview:\nThis is the first video interview with a member of the team, which helps determine if they will move forward to additional interviews. This stage ensures we are utilizing the interviewers‚Äô and candidates‚Äô time thoughtfully, and is typically either a Hiring Manager or Technical interview.\nTeam Interview:\nAll other team interviews live here.\nDebrief:\nThis will come after the reference check stage for Engineering requisitions, because the reference checks will be initiated as the Justification (R&D‚Äôs process for the Debrief stage) is initiated. For non-Engineering departments, this will be a holding stage where candidates wait until a decision is made, to track the time it takes for us to reach a decision on a candidate who has completed their interviews. See the\nEngineering‚Äôs Justification process\n.\nReference Check:\nThe reference check stage can sometimes be done in tandem with the Debrief and Background Check and Offer stages. They can be completed by the Hiring Manager or Recruiter.\nBackground Check and Offer:\nRecruiters move candidates into this stage once they‚Äôre ready to receive their verbal offer. Before that time, this stage is where an offer is prepared and goes through approvals. This is the final stage in the process.\nScheduling tools in Greenhouse\nCandidate Experience Specialists use\nModernloop\nto schedule.\nGreenhouse for internal candidates\nThere are a few elements of Greenhouse that are different for internal candidates. Please note that internal candidates refer to current, full time team members. Interns converting to full time, contractors, or rehires are not considered internal candidates.\nInterviews will always be scheduled as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù events to ensure the candidate‚Äôs privacy. Interviews will show up as ‚Äúbusy‚Äù events on candidate and interviewers calendars rather than showing as interviews.\nIf internal applicants apply via our internal job board, the yellow ‚Äúinternal applicant‚Äù tag will automatically show in the GH profile. If you don‚Äôt see this tag, you can add it by navigating to the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù tab in GH and scroll down to ‚ÄúSource & Responsibility‚Äù. Click the pencil next to Source and select Internal Applicant from the drop down.\nCES will use the internal applicant‚Äôs Google Calendar to find an appropriate time for them to meet, and do not need to be sent an availability email.\nFormer GitLab team members who re-apply are not considered internal candidates. Their source should be whatever they used to apply (ie application), and you should add a ‚ÄúFormer Team Member‚Äù tag to their profile.\nCandidate Hygiene\nMerging candidates\nRecruiters should\nmerge applicant profiles\nwhenever you see the opportunity and can verify that the candidates are the same. Merging applicant profiles allows you to keep data up to date, and also ensures that you know the full application history of anyone who applies. Aside from Internal candidates who should be merged right before hiring, you can merge candidates at any stage of the process.\nAll of Talent Acquisition has access to merge profiles. You can merge candidate profiles by viewing the right hand toolbar on an applicant profile, and clicking on either the alert that appears at the top of the toolbar or ‚ÄòSee More‚Äô in the ‚ÄòTools‚Äô section.Before beginning, please ensure that the profiles are a match for each other by verifying that their emails, phone numbers, and/or resumes are the same.\nWhen selecting which profile is Primary (right side), consider the following:\nAs a default, the most recent applicant profile should most likely be the Primary one, unless the most recent is a Prospect.\nIf this is an internal candidate, the most recent profile should always be Primary, but should not be merged until the candidate has accepted their offer to minimize the number of people with access to this information.\nAfter merging, check the Activity Feed and Details tabs to see what information was removed from old profiles and ensure that you have the most accurate Recruiter, Coordinator, and Source.\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Enablement Manager because profile merges cannot be undone.\nAdding or transferring candidates between jobs\nIf a candidate is in one job and needs to move to another, it‚Äôs important to correctly determine whether they should be added or transferred. Both are accessible by clicking the ‚ÄòAdd, Transfer, or Remove Candidate‚Äôs Jobs‚Äô button on the bottom right corner of your candidate profile.\nBefore making any moves, always ensure the candidate does not have any interviews scheduled. Transferring will automatically remove scheduled interviews and make them invisible on the candidates‚Äô Guide, but will not cancel the interview from the interviewers‚Äô calendar or inform the candidate of what is happening. Always wait until the interview has been completed, or fully cancel the interview and reschedule under the new req.\nWhen you add a candidate to a new job, the candidate starts the new job with a clean slate. There will be no scorecards or forms from any other position. This should be chosen when you are starting a brand new hiring process and will not be considering scorecards from any other job, and want their application date to be the date that you add them.\nWhen you transfer a candidate from one job to another, most of their data before the reference check stage moves with them. Scorecards will be visible in the ‚ÄúScorecards‚Äù tab and their original application date will remain. Scorecards that have not been submitted cannot be submitted after transfer, so make sure you collect those before you make your move. Offers and forms are also not transferable, so it‚Äôs important to transfer before a candidate hits the Reference Check stage. When you are moving someone from an Evergreen req into the role they will be hired into, you should always transfer. There will be no record of the previous job in any reporting.\nSometimes, deciding whether to add or transfer can be tricky. If a candidate interviewed for a role that was filled by someone else, and you get a new headcount a few months later, should you transfer them into the new job or add them and start over? One thing to consider is the implication your choice will have on the data. In this case, a candidate who transfers will appear to have been in the hiring process for months, when you‚Äôve actually only been talking to them about this opening for a few days. At the same time, you want to save their scorecards because they‚Äôll be relevant for the new job. In another situation, you could have an applicant who was being considered for the role, was rejected by the Hiring Manager, but contacted a few months later when the scope of the role changed and they were now considered a good fit. The key to knowing when to transfer is understanding what impact it would have on our data, and what solution would paint the most\naccurate\npicture. If you‚Äôre not sure whether to add or transfer, you should check in with Enablement to get another opinion.\nRejecting candidates\nWhen rejecting candidates, it‚Äôs important to carefully review all rejection reasons and pick the one that most accurately describes why a candidate is being rejected. This is because data is analyzed on a quarterly basis by the Talent Acquisition Leadership team, People Leadership Team, and E-Group.\nOnce you‚Äôve clicked the most detailed reason, include detailed context on the reason in the ‚ÄúRejection Notes‚Äù box. Please be as specific as possible. For example, instead of writing ‚Äúthe candidate rejected because of compensation‚Äù, write ‚Äúthe candidate rejected because the salary and equity that we offered was much lower than a competing offer.‚Äù\nPlease note that you cannot submit scorecards after rejecting a candidate.\nWe will not cancel an interview within less than 24 hours‚Äô notice if the candidate is being rejected. The recruiter will notify the candidate that they are no longer in consideration for the role and present them with the option to continue with the scheduled interview slot. The interviewer must be informed, and will not discuss the feedback that led to the decline. The conversation will pivot to general opportunities at GitLab and answering any questions about the company and team that the candidate may have.\nIf the candidate‚Äôs interview is outside 24 hours, the interview should be deleted in Greenhouse before the candidate is rejected and notified. The candidate should always be notified if they‚Äôve been rejected, and the recruiter  is responsible for declining the candidate. Any interviews scheduled will also not be automatically canceled, so you‚Äôll need to ensure this happens first.\nIf the candidate does not join the interview room within 10 minutes or fails to complete their MR within the specified time before the interview, the interview will be cancelled and the recruiter will get in touch with the candidate and not schedule further interviews.\nIf the candidate notifies us that they are unable to attend the interview before the scheduled time, CES can automatically reschedule using the candidates‚Äô current availability or by requesting fresh availability.\nIf we have rescheduled at the request of the candidate and the candidate requests to move the interview again without reasonable explanation, the recruiter will automatically reject the candidate.\nWe understand that there may be extenuating circumstances leading to the above situations where a candidate is unavailable or unprepared. It is at the recruiter‚Äôs discretion to reengage or choose to reschedule.\nOffers and Closing Reqs\nReference Checks\nReference check information\nReference check forms are mandatory. If you receive reference check information outside of the form and don‚Äôt want a candidate to fill it out again, Enablement can help you adjust the form to collect the remaining information. These forms are important because they provide necessary information for the accuracy and completion of a contract.\nTips and Tricks\nThese forms, just like an offer in Greenhouse,\ndo not transfer\nwhen you move a candidate from one job to another. Ensure that your candidate is in the role they‚Äôll be hired for before sending.\nCompleted forms live in a candidate‚Äôs ‚Äúapplication‚Äù tab. If you can‚Äôt find the form, it‚Äôs likely there!\nWhile nicknames, preferred last names, and PIAA details will save to the details page automatically, legal name will not. Please ensure the legal first and last name is set as the candidates‚Äô name before sending contracts.\nIf you have a candidate in the Netherlands, they are required to provide their BSN and date of birth. Recruiters should add those fields into the offer.\nOffers\nCreating an offer in Greenhouse\nCommon approval challenges\nOffer stuck in approvals: If the offer is stuck in the approvals chain because someone is out of office, the recruiter can talk to the approver‚Äôs manager about an appropriate temporary adjustment and recommend this to the Enablement team. Recruiters should be proactive in reaching out to approvers if an offer is urgent or a candidate is being inconvenienced by a long wait time. If there is a known OOO, this discussion should happen before there‚Äôs an offer waiting for approval. Enablement can help with any changes needed.\nOffer approvals chain is incorrect: If approvers are missing or incorrect, the Recruiter should contact a member of the Enablement team to adjust. The only people with access to make approvers changes are Enablement and Director, Executive Recruiting, who change approval chains to maintain confidentiality for executive positions. Often, approval chains are incorrect because you have chosen the wrong department, so it‚Äôs important to choose the right one before opening your req.\nVerbal offer information\nDeclined offer steps\nBackground screens\nContact the Senior Background Check Specialist at\nbackgroundchecks@gitlab.com\nwith any questions or requests for status updates.\nThe most commonly asked question for candidates outside the US is, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I enter more than one past employer?‚Äù Outside of ‚Äãthe US, candidates will only submit one former employer and Sterling is working as expected.\nSourcing at GitLab\nSourcing overview\nIdentifying prospects\nNotifications\nThere are no perfect or required ways to set up your Greenhouse notifications, but these are some of our recommendations.\nSlack\nTo set up Slack to notify you when you‚Äôre tagged in candidate notes, select your initials in the upper right hand corner of Greenhouse. From there, you can activate your Slack integration. Toggle the button to send @mentions to Slack. This is also a great button to point out to Hiring Managers so they are easier for the team to reach.\nAdditionally, you will see a section for ‚ÄúNotification Preferences‚Äù. Most recruiters will set these up, but they are optional if you prefer to only receive notifications by email.\nEmail notifications\nThere are two ways to set up your email notifications. The first is to select your initials in the top right corner of Greenhouse, and under ‚Äúnotification preferences‚Äù, select where you would like to receive notifications about jobs. This is an easy way for Hiring Managers to set up their preferences for all jobs at once, but may not be as easy for the Talent Acquisition team to remember to update.\nInstead, we would recommend setting your reminders either during your job setup process or after, by clicking into your Notifications tab of an individual job‚Äôs Job Setup. Here, we recommend that you stay in the loop on your candidates by electing to receive emails every time a scorecard is submitted, an internal candidate applies, a referral is submitted, and an offer is fully approved. You can choose your name or ‚ÄúCandidate‚Äôs Recruiter‚Äù, but you‚Äôll want to be sure that you‚Äôre listed as the recruiter on the role to make this work. Recruiters should double check during this time that no one is receiving notifications that should not (ie an interviewer receiving offer notifications) and adjust privacy settings accordingly.\nYou can sync your emails between Greenhouse and Gmail. Greenhouse has a Gmail add-on that can help with syncing communications. You can learn more about it by\ngoing here\n.\nTalent Acquisition Programs\nReferrals\nReferral Operations\nReferral Process\nDetails on who is eligible for referrals\nAcquisitions\nInternal Mobility\nInternal Hiring Process\nPosting a job internally\nIn the offer process\nEmerging Talent\nAssociate Engineer Development\nGlobal Hiring Resources\nGlobal hiring links\nThe\n‚Äúcountry hiring status‚Äù\nsection within the compensation calculator is the best place to look for a list of current countries available for hiring.\nThis country list\n, maintained by and accessible to recruiters, details specific information about each country that can help you answer candidate questions and prepare for potential hiring delays.\nFor general questions about specific policies or whether we support certain types of visas or sponsorship, message #people-group-confidential. If the request is more involved, or requires a conversation, you can slack Harley Devlin.\nPEO information and timelines\nFor candidates who are located in Countries where we do not have an entity, we use a PEO (Professional Employment Organization).  The actual employment contracts will be sent and issued by the PEO who also handles the processing and payment of payroll and associated taxes and compliance in each of the countries on behalf of GitLab. The contracts themselves are between the individual and the PEO.\nGitLab is currently hiring into three PEOs\nRemote.com\nGlobal Upside\nPapaya\nGlobal Expansion\nThe following timelines to onboarding are advised:\nRemote.com:\nremote.com onboarding timeline\nCountry\nWorking days\nDenmark\n3\nHungary\n4\nItaly\n3\nSweden\n3\nLuxembourg\n4\nSwitzerland\n8\nGlobal Expansion:\nProcessing contracts for candidates hired via Global Expansion could take up to 10 bueisness days.\nCountry\nWorking days\nAustria\n10 business days\nChile\n10 business days\nCosta Rica\n10 business days\nKenya\n10 business days\nLatvia\n10 business days\nMexico\n10 business days\nPhilippines\n10 business days\nSouth Africa\n10 business days\nGlobal Upside:\nCountry\nWorking days\nIndia\n10-14 business days\nPapaya\nProcessing for Italy (Dirigenti) could take up to a month, so we recommend start dates at least 6 weeks after the offer is generated.\nOther Hiring Pages\nGreenhouse\nTalent Acquisition Process Framework\nAdditional Resources\nOverview of Job Families\nBackground checks\nBenefits\nCompensation\nContracts\nGitLab talent ambassador\nOnboarding\nStock options\nVisas\nCandidate Handbook Page\nThis page outlines what hiring looks like at GitLab.

This will be achieved through 5 security operating principles:\nAccelerate business success with a focus on:\nPrioritize ‚Äòboring‚Äô, iterative solutions that minimize risk\nFind ways to say Yes\nUnderstand goals before recommending solutions\nUse GitLab first\nEfficient operations with a focus on:\nTechnical controls over handbook rules\nLeverage automation first (robots over humans)\nResponsible decisions (Spending, Tooling, Staffing, etc) over low ROI (return on investment) decisions\nReusable or repeatable over singular solutions\nTransparency with a focus on:\nResponsible protection of MNPI (material non-public information)\nEvangelize\ndogfooding\nof GitLab publicly\nLead with metrics\nBalance security with usefulness\nRisk Reduction with a focus on:\nSecure by default\nPreventative controls over detective controls\nSolving root causes over treating symptoms\nVisibility through Coverage, Discoverability, Observability\nCollaborative Culture with a focus on:\nWorking together on common solutions\nSolve shared problems with shared solutions\nSimplifying language for everyone to understand\nAvoiding security jargon\nSeek opportunities to help others succeed\nTo help achieve the vision of transparently leading the world to secure outcomes, the Security Division has nominated a\nSecurity Culture Committee\n.\nDivision Structure\nThe Security Division provides essential security operational services, is directly engaged in the development and release processes, and offers consultative and advisory services to better enable the business to function while minimising risk.\nTo reflect this, we have structured the Security Division around four key tenets, which drive the structure and the activities of our group. These are :\nProduct Security\nSecurity Operations\nCorporate Security\nSecurity Assurance\nApplication Security\nInfrastructure Security\nSecurity Platforms and Architecture\nVulnerability Management\nData Security\nSecurity Logging\nSecurity Incident Response Team (SIRT)\nTrust and Safety\nRed Team\nThreat Intelligence\nSignals Engineering\nCorporate Security\nHelpdesk Support\nTech Stack Systems\nEngineering Teams\nField Security\nSecurity Compliance\nSecurity Governance\nSecurity Risk\nSecure the Product - The Product Security Department\nThe\nProduct Security Department\nis primarily focused on Securing the Product. This reflects the Security Division‚Äôs current efforts to be involved in the Application development and Release cycle for Security Releases, Infrastructure Security, and our HackerOne bug bounty program.\nThe term ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù is interpreted broadly and includes the GitLab application itself and all other integrations and code that is developed internally to support the GitLab application for the multi-tenant SaaS. Our responsibility is to ensure all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to the highest security standards, and to be proactive and responsive to ensure world-class security in anything GitLab offers.\nProtect the Company - The Security Operations Department\nSecurity Operations Department\nteams are primarily focused on protecting GitLab the business and GitLab‚Äôs platform. This encompasses protecting company property as well as to prevent, detect and respond to risks and events targeting the business and our platform. This department includes the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and the Trust and Safety team.\nThese functions have the responsibility of shoring up and maintaining the security posture of GitLab‚Äôs platform to ensure enterprise-level security is in place to protect our new and existing customers.\nLead with Data - The Threat Management Department\nThreat Management Department\nteams are cross-functional. They are responsible for collaborating across the Security Division to identify, communicate, and remediate threats or vulnerabilities that may impact GitLab, our Team Members or our users and the community at large.\nAssure the Customer - The Security Assurance Department\nThe\nSecurity Assurance Department\nis comprised of the teams noted above. They target Customer Assurance projects among their responsibilities. This reflects the need for us to provide resources to our customers to assure them of the security and safety of GitLab as an application to use within their organisation and as a enterprise-level SaaS. This also involves providing appropriate support, services and resources to customers so that they trust GitLab as a Secure Company, as a Secure Product, and Secure SaaS\nProtect the Organization - Corporate Security\nGitLab is both a company and a product. The\nCorporate Security\ndepartment focuses on implementing and protecting the information technology (IT) related systems that the company uses to conduct business internally, and provides the hardware, software, and tools that our team members and 3rd party service providers (aka contractors) need to be productive and get their job done efficiently. The configurations that we implement for team members internally are designed to protect our customers and their data.\nWe have a 24x5\ntechnical support helpdesk\nfor team members and have engineers that configure and maintain many of our company-wide\ntech stack applications\n.\nWe invest heavily in\ndevice trust, identity management, and infrastructure governance\nto provide the highest level of security assurance for the administrators of our product and ensure all appropriate controls are in place when handling customer data.\nOther groups and individuals\nSecurity Program Management\nSecurity Program Management is responsible for complete overview and driving security initiatives across Product, Engineering, and Business Enablement. This includes the tracking, monitoring, and influencing priority of significant security objectives, goals, and plans/roadmaps from all security sub-departments.\nSecurity Program Manager Job Family\nSecurity Program areas of focus\nDrive Accountability & Visibility for Program Objectives & Goals\nDrive, Gather, & Examine Program Needs & Opportunities through Intra & Inter Organizational Collaboration\nProvide Insights & Suggestions Impacting Program Strategy & Roadmap\nAssist in Gathering & Prioritizing Program Risks, Requirements, & Alignment to Influence Remediation\nDrive & Define Acceptance Criteria, Value Proposition, Milestones to Visualize and Communicate Program Effectiveness\nDevelop Repeatable, Scalable, Efficient, Effective, Processes & Procedures\nProduct development\nIn keeping with our\ncore values\nand the belief that\neveryone can contribute\n, the Security Division is committed to\ndogfooding\nand contributing to the development of the GitLab product.\nContacting the Team\nReporting vulnerabilities and security issues\nFor information regarding GitLab‚Äôs\nHackerOne bug bounty program\n, and creating and scheduling security issues, please see our\nengaging with security\npage and our\nResponsible Disclosure Policy\n.\nReporting an Incident\nIf an urgent security incident has been identified or you suspect an incident may have occurred, please refer to\nEngaging the Security Engineer On-Call\n.  Examples include, but are not limited to:\nLost or stolen devices\nLeaked credentials\nEndpoint compromise or infection\nExposure of sensitive GitLab data\nGitLab provides a\npanic@gitlab.com\nemail address for team members to use in situations when Slack is inaccessible and immediate security response is required.\nThis email address is only accessible to GitLab team members and can be reached from their gitlab.com or personal email address as listed in Workday. Using this address provides an excellent way to limit the damage caused by a loss of one of these devices.\nAdditionally if a GitLab team member experiences a personal emergency the People Group also provides an\nemergency contact email\n.\nSub-groups and projects\nMany teams follow a convention of having a GitLab group\nteam-name-team\nwith a primary project used for issue tracking underneath\nteam-name\nor similar.\n@gitlab-com/gl-security\nis used for @‚Äòmentioning the entire Security Division\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-managers\nis used for @‚Äòmentioning all managers in the Security Division\nSecurity Division Meta\nis for Security Division initiatives,\n~meta\nand backend tasks, and catch all for anything not covered by other projects\nSecurity Assurance (@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance)\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/sec-compliance\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/field-security-team\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-risk-team\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/governance\nProduct Security (@gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security)\nProduct Security Meta\nFor department wide management and planning issues.\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/appsec\nis the primary group for @‚Äòmentioning the Application Security team.\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-research\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/threatmanagement/vulnerability-management\nSecurity Operations (@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations)\nSecurity Operations Department\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/sirt\nis the primary group for @‚Äòmentioning the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT).\nSIRT (private)\nfor SIRT issues.\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/trust-and-safety\nis the primary group for @‚Äòmentioning the Trust & Safety team.\n@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/redteam\nCorporate Security (@gitlab-com/gl-security/corp)\nFunctional Teams Org Chart\nIssue Tracker\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/managers\n- Management Team\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/helpdesk\n- End User Services Helpdesk Team (see\nSupport Handbook Page\n)\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/logistics\n- Laptop and Phone Logistics\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/code\n- Code Platforms Engineering\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/device\n- Device Trust Engineering\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/identity\n- Identity Engineering\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/infra\n- Infrastructure Governance Engineering\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/saas\n- SaaS and Tech Stack Engineering (shared responsibility handled by Device Trust and Identity Teams)\n@gitlab-com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/dept\n- Entire Department\nSlack Channels\n#security\n; Used for general security questions and posting of external links for the great discussions.

Our updates are open to all GitLab team members using the following process:\nStart of each month:\nA thread per-department is started in\n#security-division\nby each department leader (CorpSec, ProdSec, SecAssurance, SecOps). These threads are pinned for the duration of the month.\nThread template:\n<MONTH> <DEPARMENT> Weekly Updates\nExample:\nAugust Product Security Weekly Updates\nWeekly:\nAt least once a week, teams provide updates they wish to share within the appropriate thread. For example, updates from Vulnerability Management would be placed in the Product Security thread for the given month.\nThese weekly updates, while highly encouraged, are strictly optional and should represent content that ICs and managers feel should be highlighted. Teams are encouraged to define processes and DRIs around these updates that work for them.\nIndividuals providing the weekly updates are encouraged to use the ‚ÄúAlso send to #security-division‚Äù option within the thread to increase visibility.\nEnd of each month:\nDepartmental leaders prepare a monthly update, including no more than\nthree updates per team\n, and post it in\n#ciso\nwithin the first week of the following month.\nEach monthly update should include a brief preface written by the departmental leader covering any notable themes or other strategic updates.\nEach of the three updates per-team should be no more than 2-3 sentences and include at least one link to allow readers to gain additional context. Links should be to GitLab Issues or Epics wherever possible. If information is confidential and not able to be added to an Issue or Epic, a note should be added indicating this.\nIt is recommended that departmental leaders build their monthly update over the course of the month via a GitLab issue (\nsee an example\n) in collaboration with their managers and senior ICs.\nTwice-Monthly Security Leadership Meetings\nSecurity Leadership meets twice a month over Zoom to discuss division-wide topics. Individual contributors from across the security organization are invited to present their work, ideas, or projects to this leadership forum.\nIf you‚Äôre interested in presenting:\nDiscuss the topic with your manager first\nYour manager will help you:\nAdd your topic to the agenda with supporting materials\nRequest an appropriate time slot (5-25 minutes)\nCoordinate scheduling your presentation\nNote that these meetings are not on the general Security calendar. Your manager will ensure you receive the meeting invitation for your scheduled time.\nWe encourage all team members to take advantage of this opportunity to share your work and insights with security leadership.\nRansomware\nFor an overview of the communication and response process for a suspected ransomware attack, please see our\nResponding to Ransomware\npage.\nImportant topics\nTokens\nThe following best practices will help ensure tokens are handled appropriately at GitLab. For detailed requirements regarding the use of tokens at GitLab, please see our\ntoken management standard\n.\nWhen creating a\nPersonal Access Token\n, be sure to choose the appropriate\nscopes\nthat only have the permissions that are absolutely necessary.\nOftentimes a\nProject Access Token\nmight be sufficient instead of a Personal Access Token. Project Access Tokens have a much more limited scope and should be preferred over Personal Access Tokens whenever possible.\nAlways set an expiration for your tokens when creating them. Tokens should preferably expire in a matter of hours or a day.\nBe mindful to keep these personal access tokens secret. Be particularly careful not to accidentally commit them in configuration files, paste them into issue or merge request comments, or otherwise expose them.\nPlease consider periodically reviewing your currently active Personal Access Tokens and revoking any that are no longer needed.\nPersonal Access Tokens will be highly discouraged within the GitLab production environment, and disallowed/disabled wherever possible. Existing tokens shall remain, but additional issuance will not be permissible/possible.\nIf you believe a personal access token has been leaked, revoke it immediately (if possible) and\ncontact the security team\nusing the\n/security\nSlack command.\nReceive notification of security releases\nTo receive security release blog notifications delivered to your inbox, visit our\npage.\nTo receive release notifications via RSS, subscribe to our\nsecurity release RSS feed\nor our\nRSS feed for all releases\n.\nFor additional information regarding security releases, please visit the Delivery Team‚Äôs\nsecurity releases\npage.\nResources\nTools\nIncident-Tools (private)\nfor working scripts and other code during or while remediating an incident.\nIf the tool is applicable outside of the\nGitLab.com\nenvironment, consider\nif it‚Äôs possible to release when the\n~security\nissue becomes\nnon-confidential.

We don‚Äôt expect you to hit the ground running from day one.\nWe highly recommend taking at least two full weeks for onboarding and only in week three starting with team specific onboarding and training. Please feel free to participate in your team‚Äôs work in your first two weeks, but don‚Äôt feel like you have to contribute heavily.\nAll onboarding steps are in the\nonboarding issue template\nwhich is owned by the People Connect team. The onboarding process for the new team member is\nself-driven and self-learning\n, whilst also remaining as\nasynchronous\nas possible settling into the remote life at GitLab.\nAt GitLab we take great pride in\ndogfooding\nour own product, that is why all onboarding tasks are completed in a GitLab issue. First of all, what is an issue? You can learn more about what an issue is\nhere\n.\nThe People Connect Specialist assigned to the team members specific onboarding will\nopen\nthe onboarding issue at least 4 days prior to the hire date.\nEach onboarding issue has a main section that contains tasks relevant to all GitLab team-members and a due date of 30 days. Below the main section are department and role-specific tasks. Some roles and departments have tasks that link to a supplemental issue template or an additional onboarding page.  Reach out to your\nonboarding buddy\nor other GitLab team members if you need help understanding or completing any of your tasks.\nThrough onboarding issues, you should gain access to our team member\nbaseline entitlements\n. On Day 2 of onboarding an\nAccess Request\nwill be generated, if a template has been created for the role. Access requests are owned by the IT team. If you have any access requests related questions, please reach out to\n#it-help\nin Slack.\nIn certain instances, the People Connect team may not be able to assist with onboardings due to a national holiday or Family and Friends Day.

{"doc_id": "bd26664cee962fba", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/team-member-social-media-policy", "title": "Team Member Social Media Policy | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nMarketing\nTeam Member Social Media Policy\nThis is the GitLab employee social media policy\nIntroduction\nWe recognize that many team members engage in social media activity. This policy establishes a set of rules and guidelines for any activity and participation on social media channels when commenting about GitLab or GitLab-related topics.\nThese rules are intended to be adaptable to the changes in technology and norms of online communication and behavior and may be amended by GitLab at any time, for any reason, without notice to team members. However, we will work to be as transparent as possible when communicating changes, what those changes are, and when they are expected to go into effect.\nThis policy also applies to social media activity when on or off duty, while using the Company‚Äôs or personal electronic resources, and whether the team member posts anonymously or using a pseudonym.\nBe diligent, and if it‚Äôs questionable, don‚Äôt say it. You are personally responsible for the social posts, likes and shares, and replies you post on social media while representing GitLab. Everything you publish is publicly viewable and will be available for a long time, even if redacted. Remember that you represent GitLab and our culture. When commenting on posts, please keep in mind: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt argue but represent‚Äù.\nSocial Media Policy for Team Members\nYou‚Äôll be asked to confirm reading this section during your onboarding to the company. We‚Äôll ask everyone to review and sign off on review in partnership with legal for existing employees.\nIf you‚Äôve been identified as a spokesperson for the company or a specific function within GitLab, you may have unique circumstances. Please refer to your team guidelines or the communications team for more information about your work as a spokesperson and the social media policy.\nDefinition of social media\nThe GitLab Social Media policy for team members applies to traditional social media channels, like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as ‚Äúsocial-like‚Äù sites, like YouTube, HackerNews, Reddit, blogs (on the GitLab website, Medium, or any other online journals or diaries), message boards, forums (including the GitLab Forum, private groups or forums on public sites like Facebook Groups), and private/direct messages on public social media channels (Twitter DMs, Instagram Directs, etc.).\nThe term ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù applies to any online technology in use now or in the future that enables you to send or receive information and communicate or interact with others. Any site where you can share a post or comment on a post would be considered a social media website for the purposes of this policy.\nExclusions for anonymous review sites\nThis policy is not intended to limit team members from sharing their feedback or reviews of their experiences at GitLab on sites like Glassdoor, Fishbowl, Indeed, or similar sites. While we encourage you to share feedback with your manager and the people ops team, we celebrate our value of transparency and welcome feedback from team members on these sites, as long as the feedback follows our\nSAFE Framework\n.\nAll other GitLab codes of conduct and policies also apply to our social media policy\nPlease adhere to the\nCommunity Code of Conduct\n,\nAnti-Harrassment Policy\n, which includes sexual harrassment and discrimination policies, and our\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n. These policies all apply to team member behavior within social media and in public online spaces.\nSocial Media sometimes generates press and media attention or legal questions\nPlease refer all inquires to the Communications Team in the #external-comms Slack channel\nWhat you should do\nClick each recommendation below for more details\nDo disclose that you're a team member\nIf you talk about work-related matters within your job responsibility area, you must disclose your affiliation with GitLab. If you have a vested interest in something you're posting on social, point it out. You can identify yourself as a team member in your profile bio, list GitLab as your employer, or mention that you're a team member in the post itself. You can also add #LifeAtGitLab to the end of your social posts about GitLab-related topics. How you choose to disclose is up to you.\nDo state that it's your opinion\nWhen commenting\non\nthe business, you're not commenting\nfor\nthe business. Unless authorized to speak on behalf of GitLab and through comms training. However, don't add your opinion to content from a news source that includes financial figures or forecasts. If you would like to share content that includes financial figures or a forecast, please only share it without adding your commentary. Not sure if you should share? Ask in the #safe Slack channel.\nDo protect yourself\nConsider what information you're sharing online and how it can be used to identify you. Everyone has a different level of privacy they want to abide by, have you thought about yours? Some of the things folks opt-out of to protect their privacy include: not tagging specific locations in posts while you're still on-site, not including phone numbers or email addresses in plain text because bots sweep for contact info, and not showing the faces of their children on public channels. You aren't required to follow any of these specifics, but consider what kind of information will be available to the public when publishing on your social media profiles.\nDo act responsibly and ethically\nDon't misrepresent yourself. If you're not a director in your role, don't say you are. Don't imply that you're a member of a team if you're not. Share your thoughts, but disclose your role. Furthermore,\nour team members are bound by the same code of conduct we provide to the community\n.\nDo try to live our values\nEasier said than done, but consider our values when engaging online. The same space and respect we grant each other is needed with strangers on social media.\nDo share GitLab content that is already published\nIf it's written in a blog, presented at a public conference, or simply on GitLab's website, it's publicly available to share on social media. GitLab's social media advocacy tool will have a lot of preapproved content, including links, images, and copy, available to all team members. Anything already in the public domain, posted in the #newswire Slack channel, or in the company social media advocacy tool can and should be shared freely. Some items in the #newswire Slack channel may say \"shareable internal only\", so please do not share those stories on social media.\nExamples of what you should, and are encouraged, to share on social media\nGitLab\nblogs\nand\npress releases\nPositive news media that mentions GitLab and is shared in the #newswire Slack channel (team member adds no commentary/copy to the post) or is available to share in the social media advocacy tool (with commentary/copy to share)\nIndustry reports that are publicly available and are ungated\nVideos from either our\nbrand\nor\nUnfiltered\nYouTube Channels\nThird-party articles that don‚Äôt bash competitors (mentioning them or comparing GitLab and competitors is fine)\nRetweeting or sharing GitLab brand social channel posts from\nTwitter\n,\nLinkedIn\n,\nFacebook\n, or\nInstagram\nAll of the above from our eco and alliance partners\nItems that are not connected to your job or GitLab at all! Social Media is best when you bring your true-self to the mix. DevOps isn‚Äôt the only thing you‚Äôre interested in, so consider posting about other passions and topics.\nLearn more about what is encouraged and how GitLab helps to enable you to become great at using social media on our team member advocacy page.\nIt‚Äôs your job to protect GitLab, our customers, and our team members\nWhether you‚Äôre an intern or our CEO, protecting the GitLab brand, the company, and our entire team is a part of your job description.\nYou can protect GitLab by not sharing the following data with the public on your social media profiles\nClick each recommendation below for more details\nDon't speculate or add forward-looking statements\nForward-looking statements predict, project, or use future events as expectations or possibilities. Team Members mustn't speculate or add forward-looking statements to their opinions written on social media. Forward-looking statements could include company valuation, details on customer volume, subscription growth, and more. This would include forecasting, or when data is presented to argue for or against future trends. Sometimes an article from a news source will use speculative information in their story. While this is okay to share, it is not okay to share your commentary with speculative information. Not sure if it's public? Ask in the #safe Slack channel or\nreview the SAFE handbook page\n.\nSome language indicators that you're talking about forward-looking statements would be using one of the following words: \"will,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"aims,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"looking to,\" or \"continue,\".\nDon't share customer or Team Member personal information\nTeam Members are prohibited from using social media to post or display comments about co-workers or supervisors/managers of GitLab that are knowingly false, vulgar, obscene, threatening, intimidating, disparages GitLab‚Äôs products or services, depicts the team member engaging in conduct that is unlawful or in violation of GitLab‚Äôs workplace policies against workplace violence or discrimination and harassment based on any protected status under federal, state or local law. Allow the team member(s) to own the decision on what is and isn‚Äôt public about them.\nFor customers, any\ncustomer with a published case study\nis available to share publicly. If you would like to share information about a customer please reach out to the customer reference team first before sharing any content on social media.\nDon't bash competitors\nWhile sharing your opinion is a critical part of being authentic on social media, it's equally important to limit overly negative responses to competitor posts. We don't like trolls, and neither do our competitors. Providing constructive feedback is read very differently than trolling. Trolling occurs when you respond to social media posts with intentionally provocative or offensive messages.\nDon't share legal information\nNever share anything to do with a legal issue, legal case, or attorneys without first checking with legal in the #legal Slack channel. Note, that if you're looking to connect on whether or not you should publicly disclose legal issues, the answer is probably a no.\nDon't share confidential information\nDon't share information that is considered personal or GitLab proprietary confidential. If it's related to work in an issue, consider reviewing whether or not the issue was made confidential. It is inappropriate to use or disclose confidential personal information about another individual or use or disclose GitLab's proprietary confidential information in any form of social media.\nConfidential personal information refers to information that could be used to commit identity theft such as an individual's Social Security Number, financial account numbers, driver's license number or personal medical information (including family medical history).\nGitLab's proprietary confidential information refers to internal information regarding GitLab's finances, future business performance and business plans, business and brand strategies and information which is or relates to GitLab's trade secrets.\nDon't use third-party materials (including images, videos, or text) without permission from the owner\nImages, videos, and text, even if posted publicly on the internet, are copyright-protected materials and should not be used without the permission of the owner.\nIf you're unable to obtain permission from the owner, hyperlink to the relevant material rather than copying it.\nConsider using a source of permissively-licensed images, like\nunsplash.com\n, which provides free to use materials which\ndo not require attribution\n.\nYou can (and are encouraged to)share GitLab-made assets even if these contain third-party materials\nIf you're unsure what's permissible, reach out to the #legal Slack channel.\nDon't create images with, or manipulate, third-party logos without the permission of the owner\nLogos (including those indicating companies, and products and services) are registered trademarks. You must obtain the consent of the owner before using, for any purpose, any third-party logo.\nIf you're wanting to share content from GitLab's website or social channels and it has logos or trademarks from other companies, this is okay to use. The various marketing teams at GitLab are responsibile for confirming the company's use of these logos and trademarks and sharing links or images that GitLab produced does not violate this policy.\nYou can refer to other companies, or products and services, by name (without using a logo) provided that (i) the company, product or service in question could not easily be identified without using its name; and (ii) your use does not imply endorsement by, or affiliation with, the trademark owner.\nYou can (and are encouraged to)share GitLab-made assets even if these contain third-party logos\nIf you're unsure what's permissible, reach out to the #legal Slack channel.\nDon't use social media, blogs, or other digital channels for GitLab-related communications with other team members\nWhile GitLab is a transparent company, we like to keep negative feedback 1:1. Team members should not discuss work-related situations in public forums. For all communications that can be public-facing, please use issues and epics and mark them as not confidential.\nConnecting with Team Members on Social Media\nIn case you want to connect with fellow team members of GitLab on social media, you have to keep it professional. With this communication, we would like you to consider GitLab‚Äôs\nCommunication Guidelines\nat all times. Aligned with our\nAnti-Harassment Policy\n, it is expected that everyone will contribute to an inclusive and collaborative working environment and respect each other at all times.\nMimicking the GitLab brand\nKeep your identity clear on social media channels by not using the GitLab logo as your profile image, not adding GitLab to your @handle, and not adding the company name to your display names.\nUpon first glance of your social media profile, there should be immense clarity that you are a team member of GitLab and not GitLab the company. Use common sense when selecting pictures and names to use. We‚Äôll always work to get profile names and visuals updated to reflect who runs the account. If the corporate marketing team comes across profiles that don‚Äôt respond to these requests, we will report them for impersonating our brand.\nUnauthorized GitLab brand social media accounts\nAs a Team Member of GitLab, you aren‚Äôt authorized to create company/brand social media profiles to use for your work. If promoting content should come from the company, you‚Äôll need to\nopen a request issue with the organic social team\n. If the corporate marketing team encounters unauthorized profiles, they will be treated as external threats and reported for impersonation. There is no formal method for requesting new brand channels, nor is there an outline for managing to do so. It‚Äôs best to use personally identified social media profiles to share your posts.\nContests or sweepstakes on your social media profiles\nAs part of your role at GitLab, you may be responsible for a contest or a sweepstakes with social media elements. It‚Äôs important to follow legal guidelines. Essentially, as a representative of GitLab, if you‚Äôre promoting the contest on your social media channels, it will need to follow the same rules as what the GitLab brand channels will need to follow. You can\nlearn more about legal and contests in the handbook here\n.\nFollow website terms of use\nMost social media websites/services have rules concerning the use of and activity conducted on their sites. These are sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúTerms of Use.‚Äù Team Members must follow the established terms and conditions of use that have been established by the website, social media network, or channel and not do anything that would violate those rules.\nRamifications of not following the social media policy\nIf the company finds any statements or claims that are false or misleading, or we discover an activity that does not follow the policy, we will contact you to correct the situation.\nIf you are consistently disregarding the social media policy, especially if you fail to disclose your relationship to GitLab, make false or misleading statements about GitLab or our products and services, GitLab retains the right to discipline, up to termination of employment with anyone that does not comply with this policy.\nConflicts with local laws\nIn the event there is any conflict between this social media policy and local laws and/or regulations for your region, the local laws and/or regulations prevail over our policy and must be followed. However, if the conflict is simply because of practice or customs varying between regions, our social media policy must still be followed.\nAny conduct which is impermissible under the law if expressed in any other form or forum is also impermissible if expressed through social media.\nSee section below for location-specific details that are necessary to review.\nLocation-specific social media policy details\nUnited States\nConfidential proprietary information does not include information lawfully acquired by non-management employees about wages, hours or other terms and conditions of employment, if used for purposes protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act such as joining or forming a union, engaging in collective bargaining, or engaging in other concerted activity for their mutual aid or protection.\nGitLab will not enforce the social media policy in a manner that would interfere with team members‚Äô rights under the National Labor Relations Act to discuss the terms and conditions of employment.\nUnited Kingdom\nYou may not use data obtained in the course of your employment with GitLab in any way which breaches the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.\nTransform this policy into action with a social media training and certification\nTake this policy and turn it into a social media certification in less than 45 minutes with the\nsocial media 101 training and certification\n. You‚Äôll find details on the training and what to expect\nhere\n.\nLast modified November 26, 2024:\nFix broken external links (\nbc83f2be\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 2969}

If the project to you which you wish to contribute does not have a license:\nHold off making any contributions to the project until a license is in place.\nOpen an issue in the project (or contact the maintainers through other documented means).\nRequest the project adds an appropriate license citing an inability to contribute to unlicensed code.\nPotentially refer to licenses used in other projects in the same group/organization as an easy reference for the maintainer.\nIf an open source license is added, you may then contribute to the project.\nUsing open source software\nThe guidance for using open source software, including details of which licenses are pre-approved for use, is now available in the\nLegal & Corporate Affairs handbook\n.\nUsing forks in your code\nAvoid using forked code and try to contribute your change upstream.\nIt‚Äôs typical for forks to fall far behind the upstream repository and such dependencies become a source of pain:\nRebasing the branch may become non-trivial and it‚Äôd become hard to bring such dependency up to date.\nSome other library in your project might depend on the original version, creating a\ndiamond dependency problem\n.\nThere may be good reasons to create a fork:\nTo fix a security issue that is not being fixed upstream fast enough if it‚Äôs affecting us or our customers\nAny other reasons? Talk to your peers and use your best judgement.\nIf you decide to create a fork, make sure you open an issue that:\nDescribes the reason for the fork to exist\nLinks to the MR(s) where the fork was introduced as a dependency\nLinks to any relevant issues in the upstream project. If the issue was not reported already, make sure you report it in the project‚Äôs issue tracker. This is important because if the project‚Äôs maintainers don‚Äôt know about it they will not fix it\nLinks to any opened MRs/PRs to fix the issue upstream\nDescribes the remediation work needed to start using the upstream code again\nIf it‚Äôs not just changes in the forked code, but also some modifications in your code to use the fork, consider putting a TODO and a link to this issue next to that code in a comment\nGPL Cooperation Commitment\nVisit the\nLegal & Corporate Affairs Product handbook\nfor further information on this.\nOpen Source Growth Strategy\nStrategy We will be executing in 5 key areas in support of the company‚Äôs broader ‚Ä¶\nLast modified June 13, 2025:\nAdd section around contributing to unlicensed code/projects (\n8322846b\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 750}

You have a few options. You can add users to your subscription any time during the subscription  period. You can log in to your account via the\nGitLab Customers Portal\nand add more seats or\ncontact sales\nfor a quote. In either case, the cost will be prorated from the date of  quote/purchase through the end of the subscription period. You may also pay for the additional  licenses per our true-up model.\nHow will I be charged for add-on users?\nIf you have\nquarterly subscription reconciliation\nenabled (default option for new and renewing  subscriptions after Aug 1, 2021), users added during a quarter will only be charged for the remaining  quarters of their subscription term as opposed to the full annual subscription fee(s) with annual  true-ups. For example, if you add 50 users to your subscription during the third quarter of your  subscription term, the 50 users will only be charged for the fourth quarter of your subscription term  as opposed to all four quarters as per annual true-ups.\nIf you do not have quarterly subscription reconciliation enabled, add-on users will be charged annual  true-ups for the full term during which they were added. For example, if you have 100 active users  today, you should purchase a 100 user subscription. Suppose that when you renew next year you have  300 active users (200 extra users). When you renew you pay for a 300 user subscription and you also  pay the full annual fee for the 200 users that you added during the year.\nWhat happens when my subscription is about to expire or has expired?\nYou will receive a new license that you will need to upload to your GitLab instance. This can be done  by following\nthese instructions\n.\nWhat happens if I decide not to renew my subscription?\n14 days after the end of your subscription, your key will no longer work and GitLab Enterprise  Edition will not be functional anymore. You will be able to downgrade to GitLab Community Edition,  which is free to use.\nCan I acquire a mix of licenses?\nNo, all users in the group need to be on the same plan.\nHow does the license key work?\nThe license key is a static file which, upon uploading, allows GitLab Enterprise Edition to run.  During license upload we check that the active users on your GitLab Enterprise Edition instance  doesn't exceed the new number of users. During the licensed period you may add as many users as you  want.

We work across stages within the product experience to make the product as easy as possible to adopt and use.\nThe Growth section lives within Marketing & Strategy to ensure we‚Äôre aligned in our go-to-market strategy and we‚Äôre as efficient as possible in finding the right prospects, convincing them to become product users, and assisting in converting them into paying customers. Since the work within the section occurs within the product experience our engineering and user experience counterparts are within the\nDevelopment division\n. This approach ensures that we have proper alignment on our priorities from a go-to-market and business perspective while ensuring our\ndevelopment team\nis set up for success to operate within the development division.\nGrowth Section‚Äôs Principles\nThe Growth team works cross functionally within the organization to increase user and business value. We ground ourselves in four core principles.\nPartner with stakeholders in Marketing, Sales, and Product to establish metrics informed by quantitative and qualitative data that meet the business needs while supporting our users\nEmpower teams to find value efficiency in the GitLab platform\nEnable teams to quickly and intuitively adopt multiple stages with multiple users\nEmpower teams to find enterprise value within features that live in our Ultimate offering\nCore metrics, findings & experimentation results\nMetrics\nAcquisition - Valuable signup\nInternal team members can view this metric\nhere\nActivation - Team activation\nInternal team memmbers can view this metric\nhere\nFindings and experimentation results\nOur core findings and experiment results are considered non-public information. Internal team members can reference the internal handbook growth page for a detailed review of our findings.\nVision\nOur vision is to make it seamless for teams to find, adopt, and discover value along with increased efficiency in the GitLab platform.\nThis includes\nAligning internally with signups we want to prioritize as a business\nEnsuring the signup experience is balanced by collecting the information required for the business while collecting the needed user information (JTBD) to provide a tailored product experience\nAssisting users in finding product value (ah-ha moments) as quickly as possible including increasing access to enterprise value\nAssisting users in their product adoption experience that aligned with their defined JTBD\nProviding users with the purchase experiences that align with their business\nFor SMBs this means uncovering the value in the paid tiers through in-product experiences including trials married with related marketing and sales content related to their usage\nFor larger businesses, this encompasses empowering namespaces owners to understand what features their teams are using and which paid features they are requesting access to. While also providing them with the ability to connect directly with their dedicated point of contact within sales. This could include in-app messaging, and the ability to book time on their point of contact calendar directly within the app.\nGroups\nThe growth division is currently grouped under the Acquisition team that contains a shared growth backlog while we actively hire additional team members to build out a activation team.\nAcquisition\nTeam description, dedicated handbook page and specific vision is a work in progress.\nActivation\nTeam description, dedicated handbook page and specific vision is a work in progress.\nProduct ownership\nThe Growth section owns the following areas of the product experience.\nThe\nfree user\nand\ntrial registration\nexperience\nThe new user\nonboarding experience\nGitLab Experiment Gem (also refered to as GLEX)\nInstance review\nProduct Qualified Leads\nWhile we own these areas our work is not limited to these specific areas as the teams work cross-functionaly with other product and business teams to improve the user experience the most efficient way possible.\nEngineering\nGrowth engineering\nhandbook pages.\nGrowth Coffee & Learn Sessions\nGrowth requires constant learning, and many compaines face similar challenges or go through similar journeys. At GitLab, we believe hearing from growth experts and practitioners with diverse background is the best way to learn, and we want to share that with the community as much as possible. Therefore, we started a growth Coffee & Learn series since 2020. Below is a list of exerperts we invited to share their wisdom with us. We appreciate their time and insights, note that some videos/notes are viewable by internal team only.\nExpert\nBackground\nTopic\nVideo\nNotes\nChris More\nVP Growth @ Fusebit & Former Head of Growt@ Mozilla\nAMA on Open source & growth\nAMA Notes\nHolly Chen\nGrowth advisor, former head of global marketing @ Slack\nGrowth Loop & Journey of Slack\nVideo\nSummary\nLinsha Chen\nHead of Growth Data Science, Airbnb\nHow Airbnb does experimentation\nVideo\nAMA Notes\nJike Chong\nAuthor, How to Lead in Data Science, former data science executive @ LinkedIn, Acorns\nHow to Lead in Data Science\nVideo\nAMA Notes\nAnuj Adhiya\nAuthor, Growthhacking for Dummies, VP Growth\nHigh Performing Growth Teams\nVideo\nAMA Notes\nRobert Neal\nDirector of experimentation @ LaunchDarkly\nExperimentation system AMA\nVideo\nAMA Notes\nCarl Gold\nFormer Chief Data Scientist, Zuora\nFighting Churn with data\nVideo\nAMA Notes\nGrowth Definitions\nSign-up Experience:\nRegistering to be a user of GitLab. It generally starts on\nabout.gitlab.com\nand ends when the user is registered and can log in to the application. We have free, trial and direct to paid sign-up options.\nRegistration Flow:\nThe ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù flow a new user goes through when registering for GitLab and landing in the app for the first time. This is a more confined user flow, as we narrow down options so they can experience GitLab without being overwhelmed by all the other features. It starts at\nabout.gitlab.com\nand ideally ends with them using Create features.\nTrial Experience:\nThe experience of selecting and starting a trial, as well as testing/trialing features in GitLab.com or a self-managed instance during the trial. This could be done by net new users of GitLab, or existing users of GitLab who are interesting in exploring paid features.\nUser Onboarding:\nA general term that refers to experiences we create to support users during their first 90 days, or any time they engage with a new stage.\nContinuous onboarding:\nSpecifically our onboarding experience that allows users to choose when and if they want to continue onboarding tasks. It starts with simple tasks and builds to more complex ones.\nOnboarding Emails:\nRefers to emails that are sent to Saas and self-managed users intended to drive stage adoption via the email service the instance sets up.\nSaaS Purchase Flow\n- We consider the SaaS purchase flow (or ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù) to begin with the first screen of the checkout experience (the first page that displays the total cost of their GitLab subscription) and continues through the payment sequence with the last step of the flow being the successful first-time purchase of a GitLab paid tier. A potential customer can enter this experience directly within the SaaS app from the /billings page or on\nabout.gitlab.com/pricing\n.\nGrowth Shared Calendar\nWe use Growth PTO shared calendar to ensure all time off events are visible to everyone on the Growth team.

Please refer them to the job-family descriptions below.\nSupport Engineering Job Family\nSupport Management Job Family\nWhat does the Support Team do?\nWe care for our customers\nAlways assume you are the person responsible for ensuring success for the customer.\nWhen supporting a customer, any issue, incident or loss is\nGitLab‚Äôs loss\n.\nWhen a customer experiences trouble or downtime, take action with the same urgency you‚Äôd have if GitLab were experiencing downtime.\nWhen a customer is losing productivity, take action with the same urgency you‚Äôd have if GitLab were losing productivity.\nA customer with 2,500 users whose instance is down, gets the same urgency as if GitLab were losing $1,000,000 per day.\nEscalate early. Visibility across GitLab, up to and including the CEO, is always better earlier rather than later. Ensure all resources needed are on the case for customers early.\nRemember, as members of the support team we are the first to interact with someone when they have a problem or question. As such it is up to us to represent the company and make sure we present ourselves properly. Therefore we are expected to:\nAlways be friendly and respectful.\nBe open to new ideas and points of view.\nBe OK if you don‚Äôt know something. You can always ask someone else.\nBe comfortable saying no to a customer (but try to suggest a workaround and escalate to a Senior if necessary).\nWe are not commissioned or bonused\nOur goal is to provide guidance that will lead to the best results for our customers as they use GitLab. In that, we will often point to documentation, product functionality, or open bugs/feature requests.\nHowever, there are times when customers will be best served through one of our commercial offerings.\nSupport is part of the\nEngineering Department\nand Support Engineers are not commissioned or bonused for upsell for additional services, customer purchases, or lead generation.\nIf you recommend\nProfessional Services\nor moving to a different tier or offering you may link to this section in your recommendation to give the customer assurance you‚Äôre doing so with no mixed motivations.\nOur role within GitLab\nGitLab Support is part of the\nEngineering division\n.\nWhile most engineering departments are part of the R&D cost center,\nSupport is part of the Cost of Sales (or sometimes Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)) cost center.\nThis unique arrangement is expressed in our\nKey Performance Indicators\n,\nwhich are largely focused around pursuing customer success and satisfaction\nwhile driving efficiency by increasing output while keeping costs within a\npredefined range.\nThis is also why\nSupport Engineer responsibilities\ninclude contributing code and documentation and working alongside Product\nManagers on our products: By using the knowledge gained from interacting with\nour customers to make our products or docs better, we solve problems before\nthey become one. This reduces support case load while increasing efficiency for\nthe wider GitLab organization. For example, the Sales department can rely on\nour docs to answer customer queries instead of leaning on Support or Customer\nSuccess for help, freeing up more time to close sales.\nBuilding customer empathy\nPart of Support‚Äôs role is to amplify the voice of the customer. One way of doing this is inviting other GitLab team members into\nexperiences that will help them understand customer challenges with the product or our own obstacles in helping customers overcome those challenges.\nBefore you start, make sure you get light-agent access in Zendesk so that you can view Support tickets.\nIf you‚Äôre looking to get more exposure to customers, there are a few ways to get involved with Support:\nSupport Shadow Program\nGitLab team members interested in learning about the GitLab Support team and our responsibilities are encouraged to participate in the Support Shadow Program. The Support Shadow Program is a way that team members outside of Support can spend time shadowing, learning, collaborating, and working together with the GitLab Support team.\nIf you‚Äôre not part of the Support team and you‚Äôd like to participate in this program, open\na Support Shadow Program issue\nin the\nsupport-team-meta\nproject. This issue will be used to organize, plan, and track progress toward this program.\nGitLab Support uses Calendly to facilitate scheduling Shadow pairing sessions with participants. If you‚Äôre part of the Support team and you‚Äôd like to volunteer to host Support Shadow Pairing sessions with folks outside of Support, please\nopen a Schedule update request issue\nrequesting that Support Ops add you to the Support Shadow Program Calendly rotation.\nJoin Support Calls\nSupport calls are published on the\nGitLab Support Calendar\n. There are:\nCustomer calls\nbetween customers and engineers. The description will include a ticket ID. Go to\nhttps://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/<id>\nto view the ticket.\nPairing sessions\nbetween two or more engineers working on one or more tickets.\nOffice hours / Help sessions\nwhere more experienced Support engineers share their knowledge.\nTraining sessions\nwhere a member of the support team is presenting on a specific topic\nJoin an Emergency Call\nA great way to get involved is to join a customer emergency call. You can monitor\n#support_self-managed\nfor PagerDuty alerts. Alternatively,\nif you have access to PagerDuty you can be scheduled into a\nshadow rotation\n.\nHow our team helps fellow team members at all levels ‚Äì Helping Hierarchy\nIf you go through the responsibilities for each role in Support you can piece together how the organization works. We wanted to make a simple clear way to think about how the roles work together to solve problems:\nSupport Engineers help solve customer problems via tickets, merge requests, and other customer facing activities.\nManagers help solve Support Engineer problems by removing obstacles, joining in on customer facing activities, and working with support engineers to build systems that work to reduce friction and enable results and efficiency.\nSenior Leaders help resolve and avoid scaling problems by addressing team performance to KPIs, prioritizing initiatives and being responsible for the achievement of global results.\nVP of Support helps resolve and avoid company wide problems, by identifying growth and team design challenges, and reporting on progress to the Executives and Board.\nThis simple list helps to give an easy way to set expectations and align problem solving in different roles.\nHow we measure our performance\nWe use\nKey Performance Indicators\n(KPIs) to keep track of how well each Engineering Department is doing, including the Support team, as a whole.\nThe KPI measurements can be found under the\nReporting\ntab in Zendesk if you have the appropriate access, but progress on meeting these KPIs is also tracked via the aforementioned KPI link.\nWe review these KPIs weekly in the\nSupport Week-in-Review\n.\nOur Success Pillars\nIn service of achieving our KPIs and OKRs, there are three key pillars that we must balance to achieve success:\nPeople: Continue to hire excellent engineers and managers, at the right time, and the right places. Support our existing engineers and work with each team member towards realizing their full potential through professional development and smart tooling.\nProcess: Iterate on existing processes and develop new, simplified processes that enable global scaling.\nPerformance: People understand how their contributions help the global team attain our results, with guidance on what these contributions look like in practice.\nAt various times it‚Äôs easy to over-optimize on one of the pillars to solve a problem, but considering all three is key to avoiding short-sighted decision making.\nAbout the Support Team\nThe\nSingle Source of Truth\nfor information about Support Team Members - everything from email address and\npersonal interests to product skills and group memberships - is the\nsupport-team project\n.\nThe\nSupport Team Home Page\nis\nbuilt from the information in that project. Many other Support tools and\nautomations make use of it also. See the\nSupport team entry page\nof the\nSupport Team wiki\nfor details of the structure of an individual Support team member‚Äôs file.\nInformation for and about the different parts of the Support Team can be found in the following sections of the Support Handbook:\n/support/engineering\nis content that is for Support Engineers. Think: Zendesk workflows and technical resources.\n/support/license-and-renewals\nis content for the Licensing and Renewals Support Engineers and Managers. Think:\ncustomers.gitlab.com\nand working with the Fulfillment Product Team.\n/support/managers\nis content that is for Support Managers. Think: how to manage issues, run 1:1s and leadership sync information.\n/support/readiness\nis the landing page for Support Readiness. Think: how is the support team preparing for X?\nBelow we also have some commonly referenced pages:\nSupport Engineer responsibilities\nSupport Engineer knowledge areas\nSupport Engineer career path\nSupport Manager responsibilities\nFY25 Direction\nGitLab Support‚Äôs vision is to deliver a consistent, ‚Äúdelightful‚Äù experience to our customers. Our team members will collaborate across all timezones to seamlessly deliver the results our customers care about while continuing to strengthen and scale the team.\nThe overall direction for Support in FY25 will continue to build from the foundations laid in FY24. We will continue to focus on KPI achievement and evolve and iterate our approach to support, keeping the customer centered in our outcomes. Following on to the company‚Äôs overall strategic objectives, specific areas of focus are:\nOur ability to achieve business aligned results for our customers\nHow our team structure supports that ability\nMaintaining and augmenting the culture of our team\nDelighting our customers\nWhile our\npublicly visible OKR page\nand\nKey Performance Indicators\nreflect the focus and progress for the current quarter, the following provides more detail on the items included in the themes for the entire FY25.\nImproving our ability to achieve results for our customers\nFY24 was a challenging year in many aspects. As the workload and customer expectations grew, we needed to look at how we could improve efficiency and create a differentiated Support experience. FY25 is a year to focus and align on our customer needs and put our customers at the center of our understanding of their situations, perceptions, and expectations. To that end, we will:\nIterate our support model, keeping our customer experience and business vision at the forefront of our decision making.\nAdopt a prioritization strategy incorporating our customers‚Äô business impact and GitLab business need, while building an understanding within the Support team for the why behind it.\nExamine and shape the macro and micro trends in group performance and individual efficiency.\nBuild a compelling customer digital support experience that will improve the customer journey and reduce toil for our team.\nTeam structure and how it supports our ability to achieve results\nIn FY23 / FY24 we moved towards dividing the team into globally distributed groups of engineers. In FY25 we‚Äôll build on that foundation and extend towards differentiating support offerings to better align with customer requirements. This year, we will:\nProgress enhanced support offerings while partnering more closely with the Customer Success Team to meet our customers‚Äô business needs.\nImprove how we route and address customer tickets to an appropriate expert with a mind for growing individual engineers from just starting their support journey to complete stewardship of the support journey experience.\nTeam culture and how it supports our ability to achieve results\nAs GitLab grows, Support‚Äôs influence within the company as advocates for customers must also grow. We need to continue to strengthen the Values-driven cultural attributes that promote efficient collaboration and results for customers while maintaining GitLab Support as a great place to work. In FY25 we will:\nBuild leaders and influencers within GitLab as advocates for customers.\nExpand our enablement, training, and education to prepare the current and future generations of Support Engineers to meet the needs of our customers.\nDelight our customers\nFY24 was a year of better understanding the needs of our customers. In FY25 we will focus on\ndelighting\nthem. We will:\nPair with our customers and train engineers in setting and exceeding customer expectations.\nImprove our ways to serve customers and resolve their problems before a ticket is even opened while keeping that context to enrich tickets for Support Engineers if a ticket\nis\nneeded.\nImprove our understanding of Support Delivery Quality and how we can consistently provide world class service.\nWe are also Product Development\nUnlike typical companies, part of the mandates of our Security, Infrastructure, and Support Departments is to contribute to the development of the GitLab Product. This follows from these concepts, many of which are also behaviors attached to our\ncore values\n:\nDogfooding\nEveryone can contribute\nAs such, everyone in the department should be familiar with, and be acting upon, the following statements:\nWe should all feel comfortable contributing to the GitLab open source project\nIf we need something, our first instinct should be to get it into the open source project so it can be given back to the community\nTry to get it in the open source project first, rather than later, even if it‚Äôs 2x harder\nWe should be using the whole product to do our jobs\nWe are all familiar with our\nDogfooding process\nand follow it\nWe should not expect new team members to join the company with these instincts, so we should be willing to teach them\nIt is part of managers‚Äô responsibility to teach these values and behaviors\nDogfooding in Support\nCiting our\ndogfooding\noperating principle, people sometimes ask why GitLab Support doesn‚Äôt use\nService Desk\n.\nDogfooding is using a piece of GitLab\nfor its intended purpose\n. For example, one\ncould\nuse GitLab issues as a newsletter (and we do! See:\nSupport Week in Review\n), but creating merge requests to help Issues serve as a newsletter more effectively wouldn‚Äôt be dogfooding unless that improvement also helps its core use case.\nIn other words: Dogfooding is using the product in the way that our customers would use it to the end of discovering and solving pain points that they have. Dogfooding supports customer results.\nAt GitLab Support we use Service Desk to process\nPersonal Data Requests\n, but not for our global support because the customer for Service Desk is primarily small teams soliciting\nbug reports, feature requests, or general feedback\n. Through our use of Service Desk in this smaller setting we‚Äôve been able to influence product direction towards adding features like\ninternal notes\n.\nWe continually evaluate product features for use-cases within Support and provide feedback and feature requests where blockers exist. Support will always prioritize customer results over any other consideration.\nOKRs\nCurrent Quarter\nThese were previously populated via a tool we are no longer using.\nTODO: Replace with current GitLab implementation\nPrevious Quarter\nThese were previously populated via a tool we are no longer using.\nTODO: Replace with current GitLab implementation\nHazards and Challenges\nSee\nManagers/Hazards page\nCommunications\nThe GitLab Support Team is part of the wider Engineering function. Be sure to check the\ncommunications section in the Engineering handbook\nfor tips on how to keep yourself informed about engineering announcements and initiatives.\nHere are our most important modes of communication:\nSupport Week in Review\n. Important updates for everyone in support.\nThe SWIR is expected reading/listening for all support team members. You should try to check the SWIR at least once a week. If you have something to share with the entire team this is the best place to do it. For example, if you have an issue for a common bug, an issue that requires feedback, or an issue about an external project you‚Äôre working on.\nSlack channels\nfor\n‚Äúinformal‚Äù\ncommunication.\nDue to our data retention policy in Slack, things shared there will eventually be deleted. If you want to share something there, please make sure it also has a more permanent place in our docs, handbook, issue tracker, etc.\nMeta issue tracker\nfor any issues regarding workflows,\ngeneral team suggestions, tasks or projects related to support, etc.\nWhere we want to ensure that important messages are passed to the global support team, we will use this\nmessaging template\n. This ensures that these messages are delivered across our communications channels in a structured and documented manner.\nGitLab.com\nGroups\nWe use the following GitLab Groups to notify or add support team members to issues and merge requests on\nGitLab.com.\nGroup\nWho\n@gitlab-com/support\nAll Support Team members\n@gitlab-com/support/amer\nAMER Support\n@gitlab-com/support/apac\nAPAC Support\n@gitlab-com/support/emea\nEMEA Support\n@gitlab-com/support/dotcom\nSupport members with primary SaaS focus and GitLab.com admin access\n@gitlab-com/support/dotcom/console\nSupport members with GitLab.com console access\n@gitlab-com/support/customers-console\nSupport members with CustomersDot console access\n@gitlab-com/support/licensing-subscription\nSupport members focused on License and Renewals\n@gitlab-com/support/managers\nAll support managers\n@gitlab-com/support/managers/amer\nAll AMER support managers\n@gitlab-com/support/managers/apac\nAll APAC support managers\n@gitlab-com/support/managers/emea\nAll EMEA support managers\nProjects\nOur team projects and issue trackers can be found in the\nSupport parent group\n.

As only 90 days of activity will be retained, make sure\nto move important information into the team handbook, product documentation,\nissue trackers or customer tickets.\nspt_vs. support_ prefix\nWhen naming channels, ‚Äúspt‚Äù is meant for internal channels, meaning those that will be of use to the Support Team mainly. They should be public so others may join if they choose. If a channel has a ‚Äúsupport‚Äù prefix, it is meant as a public interface where other teams will interact with the Support Team.\nDaily Stand-up bot\nThe\nSupport Daily Slackbot\nis an automated tool designed to facilitate daily standup Slack threads across\nvarious teams and regions at GitLab.

These office hours are intended to strengthen\nthe team through mentoring. It is up to each Senior/Staff Support Engineer whether they schedule office hours, and how\noften. Please see the ‚ÄúGitLab Support‚Äù Team calendar to view office hours and invite yourself.\nWe encourage hosts to include what they will cover in the calendar event description and optionally a document to track.\nSome ideas of what one can expect at a Senior/Staff Support Engineers‚Äô office hour:\nTroubleshooting a difficult ticket\nTrying out a GitLab feature (Geo, CI, SAST, k8s, etc.) or a new workflow\nReproducing a particular bug\nFixing a bug\nCreating or updating documentation\nThinking through a particular problem\nHosting a ticket crush session\nCreating a Meeting\nYou may wish to host a sync call. To do so, you can create an event on the\nSupport Calendar.\n. To invite team members to the event, you can use the appropriate\nSupport email alias\n(internal Handbook, GitLab team members only)\nSupport Week in Review\nEvery Friday, we do a week in review, inspired by the\ngreater Engineering organization week in review\n.  You can add topics any time by using the SWIR\ntopic form\n.\nAny workflow changes or announcements should be shared in the SWIR and we recommend you check at least once a week to stay up to date on recent changes. Ideally, the information shared here should have a permanent location such as an issue or merge request.\nHow to read/listen to the SWIR\nYou can read the Support Week in Review by viewing the\nmore recent issue\nwith the\nSWIR::Digest\nlabel in the\nSWIR project\n.\nYou can subscribe to this label to be notified when the latest SWIR has been generated.\nFor audio editions recorded after 2022/07/01, you can find a link to the audio edition of the SWIR within the respective issue (this is so we comply with the\nSAFE framework\n. An archive of all audio editions can be found in the\nSupport Week in Review - Audio Edition folder\non Google Drive (internal only).\nWe encourage anyone in the team to share.\nSWIR Topics\nWe currently have the following topics, each in its own section in the SWIR:\nActionable\n. For items that require a decision to be made or action to be taken (such as, asking for feedback on an issue).\nThings to know about\n. Share items that you would like to share with the team, like projects you‚Äôre working on, known bugs, new workflows, cool articles you found, etc.\nTeam Member updates\n. New team members, internal transfers and nother news about our team members!\nWhat Did we Learn this Week\n. A space to share things you‚Äôve discovered (or rediscovered!) and learnt.\nSupport Operations Corner\n. Announcements and information from the Support Operations team\nKudos\n. Give a special kudos to other team members or highlight something they did.\n-\n. A selection of the positive SSAT feedback received from customers during the week\nMetrics report\n. Review the support metrics for the span of the week.\nSWIR Labels\nSWIR Issues can also have their own Tags or Labels in the GitLab project. These are used to highlight specific Areas of Focus (L&R, SaaS‚Ä¶). Labels are used on the Issues only, they do not appear in the digest Issue nor in the Google doc.\nOne label,\nManager Attention\n, is used for policy changes or other topics of\nwhich Support Managers should specifically be made aware. You can find the\nManager Attention\nlabel\nhere\n]\nand subscribe to it.\nYou can read about the origins of the auto-generated SWIR\nin this issue\n.\nCross-Department Roles\nThe Support Team collaborates with many other departments throughout GitLab -\nSales, Channel, Product and Legal, to name a few. And we have created two\ndifferent roles to help those collaborations to be as effective and efficient\nas possible.\nSupport Stable Counterpart\nThe Support Stable Counterpart role is designed to provide a strong connection\nbetween a product or non-product team and Support. The purpose is discussing\nproduct issues, sharing product knowledge and representing customer needs, as\nwell as sharing knowledge about each team‚Äôs work and developing processes and\ndocumentation to allow the two teams to work together well. If you are interested\nin becoming a Support Stable Counterpart, or would like to learn more about the\nrole, read the\nSupport Stable Counterparts\npage.\nProcesses\nUpdating Support Team documents using merge requests\nThe Support Team records our institutional knowledge, processes and workflows\nin multiple places, such as the handbook and project issues templates. When\nupdating such documents, make sure to have visible artifacts of approval on\nyour merge requests before merging even if you have received approval somewhere\nelse. This avoids the impression of changes being made without any oversight\nor accountability.\nArtifacts of approval can include:\nGetting a peer or manager to review and merge your MR\nA peer or manager showing their approval using\nMR approvals\nA peer or manager commenting ‚Äúlooks good to me‚Äù\nSupport Workflows\nInternal Policies and Procedures Wiki\nHow to Work with Tickets\nHow to Submit issues to Product/Development\nHow to Submit Code to the GitLab Application\nHow to Submit Docs when working on customer issues\nLicense & Renewals Workflows\nSlack Workflows\nEach Slack channel within Support has a number of\nWorkflows\nattached to them that are used to provide information to users. The source files for each workflow live in the\nslack-workflows\nproject.\nIssue Notification\nSome workflows are meant to notify the team of new issues created in the relevant project.\nIn these cases, a\nproject webhook\npasses information to\nZapier\n,\nwhich then sends the information to a Slack workflow.\n#support_gitlab-com\nGitLab Project\n,\nZap\n,\nSlack workflow\n#support_licensing-subscription\nL&R related internal requests\nGitLab Project\n,\nZap\n,\nSlack workflow\nEmoji Reaction\nProviding information by reacting to a message with a specific emoji.\n#support_escalations\nTicket Escalation\n-\n:escalate:\n- Directs the user to follow the proper procedure to escalate a support ticket or internal issue.\n#support_gitlab-com\nTicket Escalation\n-\n:escalate:\n- Directs the user to follow the proper procedure to escalate a support ticket or internal issue.\nQuestion Redirect\n-\n:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:\n- Directs the user to post their question in a more appropriate Slack channel.\nRemove Link Preview\n-\n:slack:\n- Politely asks the user to remove any unfurled link previews in their message.\nWelcome\n- This automated workflow automatically sends a direct message to new members of the channel that contains helpful information.\nContact Management -\n:admission_tickets:\n- Direct the user to follow the proper procedure to manage the support contacts for a Zendesk Global organization.\n#support_self-managed\nTicket Escalation\n-\n:escalate:\n- Directs the user to follow the proper procedure to escalate a support ticket or internal issue.\n#support_licensing-subscription\nTicket Escalation\n-\n:escalate:\n- Directs the user to follow the proper procedure to escalate a support ticket or internal issue.\nTime Off\nSee the\nSupport Time Off page\nOnboarding\nSee the\nSupport Onboarding page\nPromotion\nAfter getting promoted, make sure to update your title in:\nour\nSupport team page\n, and the change would be reflected in Zendesk\nthe company team page following the same steps in\nAdd yourself to the Team Page\nConsider updating the title on Slack and on Zoom, following the guidelines in\nZoom name format\n.\nSupport Pods\nIn GitLab Support, we use\nSupport Pods\nto organize support engineers as they\nwork. Each Support Pod is a cross-region, single skill group of engineers who\nare interested in their Support Pod‚Äôs specific product area. They are engineer-\nlead. To join or start a Support Pod you can read more below.\nSee the\nSupport Pods handbook page\nand the\nWorking with Support Pods workflow page\n.\nImproving our processes - ‚ÄòActive Now‚Äô issue board\nThe Support team uses\n‚Äòsupport-team-meta‚Äô project issues\nto track ideas and initiatives to improve our processes. The\n‚ÄòActive Now‚Äô issue board\nshows what we‚Äôre currently working on. It uses three labels:\nBlocked\n- waiting for another team or external resource before we can move ahead\nDiscussing this week\n- under active discussion to arrive at a decision\nIn Progress\n- actively being worked on\nSome principles guide how these labels are used:\nmaximum of six issues\nat any time for each label (18 total issues)\nAll issues with one of the above labels must be\nassigned\nto one or more support team members\nAll issues with one of the above labels must have a\ndue date\nno longer than a week ahead\nIf an issue is too big to complete in a week it should be\nsplit into smaller parts that can be completed in a week\n(a larger ‚Äòparent‚Äô issue is OK to keep in the project, but it shouldn‚Äôt make it onto the ‚ÄòIn Progress‚Äô column)\nEach week we look at the board and discuss the issues to keep things moving forward.\nBy keeping a maximum of six issues for each label, we\nlimit work in progress\nand make sure things are completed before starting new tasks.\nAdding and managing items on the board:\nSupport managers will regularly review the board to keep items moving forward.\nThe team can\nvote on issues not on the board\nby giving a ‚Äôthumbs up‚Äô emoji so we can see\npopular issues\n.\nSupport managers will look at popular issues and add them to the board when there is room.\nSupport managers will\ncurate\nissues to prevent a large backlog.

{"doc_id": "786d040399471af5", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/pricing", "title": "Pricing model | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nAbout GitLab\nPricing model\nMost GitLab functionality is and will be available for free in our Free tier. Paid tiers include features targeted for managers, directors, and executives.\nGitLab‚Äôs pricing strategy is set by the CEO. Everyone can contribute, and the best way to communicate is on the #pricing Slack channel.\nContributions are part of the day-to-day jobs of the following people:\nPrincipal Pricing Manager (Sean Hall)\nSenior Pricing Manager (Sarah DeVries)\nVP, Product Management (Justin Farris)\nPricing Strategy\nMost of GitLab functionality is and will be available for free in our Free tier. Our paid\ntiers include features that are\nmore relevant for managers, directors, and executives\n.\nWe promise\nall major features in\nour scope\nare available in Free too. Instead of charging for specific parts of our scope\n(CI, Monitoring, etc.) we charge for smaller features that you are more likely\nto need if you use GitLab with a lot of users. There are a couple of reasons for\nthis:\nWe want to be a good\nsteward of our open source product\n.\nGiving a great free product is part of our go to market, it helps create new users and customers.\nHaving our scope available to all users increases adoption of our scope and helps people see the benefit of a\nsingle application\n.\nIncluding all major features in Free helps reduce merge conflicts between CE and EE\nBecause we have a great free product we can‚Äôt have one price. Setting it high\nwould make the difference from the free version too high. Setting it low would\nmake it hard to run a sustainable business. There is no middle ground that would\nwork out with one price.\nThat is why we have\nPremium and Ultimate tiers\n.\nThe price difference between them is half an order of magnitude (5x).\nWe will charge per user, per\napplication, or per instance. We do include free minutes with our subscriptions\nand trials to make it easier for users to get started. As we look towards more\ndeployment-related functionality on SaaS it‚Äôs tempting to offer compute and\ncharge a percent on top of, for example, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We don‚Äôt\nwant to charge an ambiguous margin on top of another provider since this limits\nuser choice and is not transparent. So we will always let you BYOK (bring your\nown Kubernetes) and never lock you into our infrastructure to charge you an\nopaque premium on those costs.\nThe Value of Free users\nAs a commercial organization, we always want to grow the number of paying customers, therefore we are focused on increasing the free to paid conversion rate. However, GitLab offers a free product, and our free users bring tremendous value to the company beyond just the likelihood of converting to a paid customer one day.\nAwareness/Mindshare: A large free user base helps GitLab become known to the developer community and stay top of mind.\nProduct Familiarity/Training: Offering a free product invites anyone to try out GitLab without any barrier so many developers become familiar with GitLab. Through using the free product, many users are trained on how to use GitLab functionality which makes them more effective when using GitLab for their job.\nAdvocacy/Internal Champion: Happy loyal free users become advocates of GitLab, which brings more users and strengthens our brand. We often see users of GitLab for personal projects then become an internal champions to advocate their employers to buy GitLab. This personal use -> organizational use cross over and bottoms-up growth can‚Äôt happen without our free product.\nContributions/Community: Many free users are also active contributors to the product so they make GitLab better. They also help grow our community which becomes an even more valuable asset to all free and paid customers.\nThird party support/Platform: Free users increase our total user base, and a large user base makes 3rd party tools/APIs/integrations more likely to support GitLab, growing our ecosystem and enhancing our platform status.\nEnable product-led growth & Reduce Customer Acquisition Cost: our free product enables GitLab to acquire more users at a lower customer acquisition cost, as some of them will purchase via self-service funnel since they are already familiar with GitLab and won‚Äôt require a full sales cycle to be convinced to buy.\nUser habit/Retention lever: offering a free product allows users to develop a habit before they pay, therefore the paid customers are more likely to see higher ROI of GitLab. Additionally, even if the customer stays on the free plan, we are not losing the customer to a competitor.\nPricing Philosophy\nOur pricing philosophy is aligned with our\n.\nCollaboration\n: We want to keep the trust of our customers through a pricing approach that supports long-lasting customer relationships.\nResults\n: We aim to get a great ROI for our customers while maximizing IACV for GitLab over the long-term.\nEfficiency\n: Our pricing approach should be easy to understand, plan, and order.\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n: We build GitLab to be the best option for a wide variety of organizations, including educational institutions and organizations in different geographic regions.\nIteration\n: We want to encourage the full scope of GitLab to be adopted over time.\nTransparency\n: We are public and explicit about what our pricing is based on.\nPricing Methodology\nWe take a value-based pricing approach at GitLab. The core of the value-based pricing is to understand the value proposition that our innovations provide to our current and future customers for that offering. We aim to price our offerings to achieve continued growth and financial success for both the customer and GitLab.\n1. Value Proposition\nTo understand the value that we deliver to our customers, we focus on the benefits that our customers can receive to achieve their business goals. The value to our customers can include:\nDevelopment cost reduction\nRevenue gain due to decreased time to market\nImproved reliability and security\nGreater and more effective collaboration\nEmotional contribution of having delighted users\n2. Customer Collaboration\nDefining and quantifying the value being delivered does not happen in isolation. We regularly engage with customers to understand how our solutions help them. These engagements are important as they will provide insights on how our innovations are valued by the customers and how it impacts our customers‚Äô willingness to pay. Willingness to pay is a crucial element when we decide on how to price and packaging our offerings.\n3. Competitive Landscape\nWe understand that customers have choices when they decide to make a purchase. Hence,  understanding the competitive landscape of our products is very critical. With respect to competition, we focus on the key differences between our value proposition and the competition‚Äôs value proposition. Our pricing aims to reflect the differential value that we provide. We aim to design the pricing structure that works best for our customers compared to our competitors inclusive of pricing metric.\n4. Mutual Success\nTo following our pricing philosophy, we aim to support long-lasting customer relationships. When we develop our pricing, the target is that both our customers and GitLab become successful together. For long term success, where we can run a sustainable business and meet our company‚Äôs financial goals, we do also consider cost to serve and margins as factors when pricing is determined. It is important to note that while costs and margins are factors in pricing, value provided to our customers is the foundational element.\nDepartments and Decision Making\nPricing affects Product, Marketing, and Sales.\nTherefore, general pricing decisions are made by the CEO.\nProduct makes most decisions on a day-to-day basis about what feature should go\nin what plan based on\nthe paid tiers\n.\nThe following table describes how large cross-functional pricing decisions should be made.  This decision making method differs from our normal\nmethod due to the extremely cross-functional nature and business risk of large pricing decisions.\nResponsibility\nRole\nDescription\nResponsible\nGroup Manager, Pricing\nResponsible for analysis and recommendation\nAgree\nVP Monetization, Chief Product Officer, CRO\nShould ideally agree with the recommendation\nPerform\nPricing, Fulfillment, Sales Ops, Product Marketing, and Website teams\nExecutes the recommendation\nInput\nShould be consulted and allowed to provide input prior to decision\nDecide\nFinal decision maker\nTo ensure alignment across stakeholders, a monthly Pricing Steering Committee is held to align on upcoming monetization decisions, discuss historical insights/trends, and prioritize areas of opportunity.\nThree Tiers\nWe have three pricing tiers.\nHow we make decisions on a day-to-day basis is specified on our\nstewardship page\n.\nSelf-Managed/SaaS tier\nFree\nPremium\nUltimate\nPer user per month\n$0\n$29\n$99\nWho cares most about the feature\nIndividual Contributors\nDirectors\nExecutives\nMain competitor\nGitHub Team\nGitHub Enterprise\nVeracode, Checkmarx\nType of sell\nNo sell\nBenefit/solution\nTransformation\nBuyer Based Tiering Clarification\nWhen considering buyers as part of product tiering decisions we use the following guidance:\nFree is for a single developer, with the purchasing decision led by that same person\nPremium is for team(s) usage, with the purchasing decision led by one or more Directors\nUltimate is for strategic organizational usage, with the purchasing decision led by one or more Execs\nWhen the tiering of a feature is being evaluated, the\nstewardship promise\nwill override this guidance.\nExamples\nUnderstanding the distinction of our buyer-based model can be difficult. In it we focus not on the user of the feature, but on the buyer and in what cases a feature would be useful to that buyer even in cases where the buyer is not the user. When making these decisions we ask questions like:\nWho would drive the demand for this feature?\nAt what level of an organization does this feature add value?\nBelow we list product categories and the current and proposed features which reside in a given tier to highlight how the buyer-based model works in practice.\nFeature - Kanban Boards\nProject and Group Boards (Free)\n: The primary user and buyer for Issue Boards in general is Individual Contributors. While group boards likely span teams, there are also valid use cases for an individual to organize code in several projects and manage issues across those projects at the group level. The key differentiation is that an Individual Contributor will likely only ever need a single group level Issue Board; whereas Managers need several group level Issue Boards to facilitate their team‚Äôs workflows. (\nDocumentation\n)\nIssue Weight on Boards (Premium)\n: The users assigning issue weights are individual contributors but the value of that weight is for Directors of teams to ensure proper milestone planning. (Documentation\nwith respect to boards\n)\nMultiple Group Issue Boards (Premium)\n: Issue boards which span groups are valuable to and also utilized by groups of groups which aligns to Director level likely buyer. (\nRelated documentation\n)\nIssue Board Epic Swimlanes (Ultimate)\n: Everyday users of swimlanes might be individual contributors but their value is in the visualization of activity for company wide portfolio management by Executives. (\nRelated issue\n)\nFeature - Merge Requests\nMerge conflict resolution (Free)\n: Resolving merge conflicts is part of the daily workflow and valuable to Individual Contributors. (\nDocumentation\n)\nMerge approvals (Premium)\n: Requiring approvals on merge requests is only useful when there is a team working on a project and their Director (who isn‚Äôt likely to be the user of approvals) requires specific individuals to provide their approval. (\nDocumentation\n)\nMerge request reviews (Premium)\n: Merge request reviews enables the expedient review by multiple team members on merge requests. Typically large enough teams to value the reduced chatter accompanying MR reviews reside under Directors. (\nDocumentation\n)\nFeature - Pipelines\nBuilt in CI Pipelines (Free)\n: CI Pipelines are integral to GitLab and used primarily by Individual Contributors. (\nDocumentation\n)\nShow pipeline code coverage rate (Premium)\n: The ability to determine code coverage rate is particularly valuable to Directors. (\nDocumentation\n)\nPipeline dashboards (Premium)\n: Dashboards of pipelines across groups and projects are primarily used and valued by Directors. (\nDocumentation\n)\nDownloadable all pipeline logs (Ultimate)\n: Pipeline logs would be generated and even downloaded by individual contributors, but the value of collating these logs is provided to Executives responsible for ensuring compliance.\nUsage can be more important than buyer-based tiering\nWhile our\ntiers\nare based on who leads the purchasing decision there are occasions where driving increased usage takes precedence over the natural buyer-based tiering, always in favor of moving features to lower tiers. Here‚Äôs why:\nAs GitLab develops new categories that are likely to be in paid tiers, it is still reasonable (and in many cases advisable) to get the early MVC versions to land in the free or lower paid-tier to spur adoption, encourage contributions and gain feedback from the wider user base. Over time, the team can then add more features on top of the MVC functionality that will be placed in the paid-tiers. However, Product Managers should not move features down in violation of the buyer-based model unless there is a concrete high confidence plan to follow up with meaningful additions to the base feature that can be added to and monetized with the right paid tier\nOur dual flywheels work because of increased users.  Having capabilities in open-source - even for those oriented towards teams encourages more usage - increased users. Those users are essential to creating contributors, an improved product and future tiered features.\nWhen considering tiering, if the feature is geared to be used (not purchased) by individuals and the answer to the question of\nwho cares most about this feature?\nis\ntoday - very few people\nwe should consider open-sourcing it to get more usage and contributors. Regardless of the reasoning behind the down-tiering of a feature, the\nprocess\nshould still be followed.\nPrevent the ability to circumvent tiering\nIf a feature in the free tier (typically useful to ICs, but also to others) will open up the possibility to circumvent or abuse our tiering policy, we should exercise extreme caution and err on the side of maintaining the feature in a paid tier. An example of this is\nrepo pull mirroring\nthat is useful for ICs and can also be great for adoption (i.e. trying out GitLab.). However, it may also lead to larger instances in Free tier mirroring to smaller instances in paid tiers to make use of paid-tiered features. This goes against our pricing terms & conditions and therefore we chose to keep the feature in a paid tier instead of Free tier.\nPartner integration considerations\nWhen building integrations to partners it is possible to make exceptions to our buyer-based model when our tiers don‚Äôt align well with those of the partner, but only in favor of lower tiers. As an example - a partner who provides a team collaboration tool with a free tier might desire any GitLab integration to be present in our free tier despite it clearly being appropriate for single team usage. The go-to-market benefits of this partnership can outweigh the divergence from our buyer-based model.\nThemes\nWe‚Äôve found that bundling our features within tiers into themes\nresulted in improved conversion performance on our pricing page\n. While it is how we present the value of our tiers, this themes-based representation serves as an additive filter for, and is not a replace of, our Buyer Based Tiering decision.\nThemes are then bundled into\ncustomer value drivers\n.\ngraph TD;\nFeatures-->Categories;\nCategories-->Groups;\nGroups-->Stages;\nStages-->Sections;\nFeatures-->Themes;\nThemes-->ValueDrivers(Value Drivers);\nCurrent Theme List\nThe following are our current set of capabilities:\nPremium\nFaster code reviews\nAdvanced CI/CD\nEnterprise agile planning\nRelease controls\nSelf-managed reliability\n10,000 compute minutes per month\nSupport\nUltimate\nAdvanced security testing\nSecurity risk mitigation\nCompliance\nPortfolio management\nValue stream management\nFree guest users\n50,000 compute minutes per month\nSupport\nWhat happens when themes don‚Äôt match our Buyer Based Tiering Decisions?\nBecause themes are filters for our Buyer Based tiers, there can occasionally be instances where a feature‚Äôs tier and its natural theme don‚Äôt match. In that case we should either:\nAdjust the feature‚Äôs tier to match\nAdjust the feature to a different theme to match\nAdjust the naming of the theme to better capture the distinction between tiers\nNote - it is OK for the features of a theme to be in the listed tier and any lower tier.\nLower tiers have more relative value\nOur lower tiers have:\nA lower price.\nA lower discount we give (price after discount is closer to list price both absolute and as a percentage).\nThe price charged for value generated is lower.\nMore value per dollar as a percentage (in absolute numbers higher tiers generate more net value)\nOur higher tier is still the best option for our customers:\nHigher tier adds much more absolute value. For example our top tier can add 2000% more value than our lower tier while still adding less relative value.\nThe Return On Investment (ROI) for higher tiers tends to be better than our lower tiers due to costs outside of the subscription. For example, when you switch to GitLab you will have a fixed cost in implementation and training. And if you use a lower tier you need to find a workaround for features you are missing out on, increasing cost and decreasing efficiency.\nThere are multiple reasons why our lower tiers have more relative value:\nThe lower tiers are older so they had more time to accumulate features.\nAny pricing model will have to be compatible with our open source tier. The open source tier should be the top alternative to our priced tiers. That tier has zero cost, zero discounting, a zero price charged for value generated, and infinite value per dollar. Our lowest tier should be the tier that is closest to that to make it possible for people to go from free to paid. As soon as they are paid we can help them to generate more value with GitLab, for example by using more stages. If they realize more value we can move them up in tiers.\nThe lower tiers (including open source) are a pipeline of future customers for the higher tiers.\nWe can easily increase revenue in the next 3 years by raising prices and/or making lower tiers less attractive (of course\nnever by moving features up\n). But we are optimizing the Net Present Value (\n) of the company with a 10% a year discount rate. This means we have to look beyond 3 years.\nRaising prices on our lower tiers might cause more revenue in the short term, both directly and by compelling most organizations to move to higher tiers. But the minority of organizations that switch to a competition will cause them to be much harder for us to reach in the future and will allow competitors a flywheel effect of their own. This tradeoff has to be calculated explicitly when raising prices.\nThat our lower tiers are popular is not a pricing problem but a communication problem. Higher priced tiers have less value per dollar as a percentage but generate more net value in absolute terms. It is up to us to explain that value in the product, with marketing, and in our sales interactions.\nOpen core projects capture (ratio of value created vs. captured) less value than proprietary projects. Because the pricing tiers are low relative to the value created the difference between the tiers can be much higher than with proprietary software. If you capture 1% you can easily introduce a new tier at 5x, if you capture 50% even doubling your price will take away all benefit for the customer.\nWe see customers on Premium but not users on Free. If we focus only on the visible customers that are on Premium we miss the largest opportunity. Premium is priced too if the conversion from Premium to Ultimate is lower than organizations becoming customers after using free. Currently this is not the case because it is much harder reaching out to free users since they aren‚Äôt customers and we don‚Äôt have a point of contact to discuss the value of higher tiers.\nArguments in favor of raising the price of the lower tier (which we won‚Äôt necessarily do) are:\nOur sales effort don‚Äôt change much with the plan, making lower tiers relatively much more expensive to sell.\nOver time we keep adding features to the lower tiers due to our\nBuyer Based Open Core model\nso you would expect prices to rise.\nWhile the absolute value of higher tiers is better and that seems the most rational measure people also do look at relative value and we should make sure that the price to go to a higher tiers is perceived well.\nMany successful open source companies charge a relatively high price for their most affordable plan.\nThe future growth of GitLab is much more influenced by how many people are using the open source version than our lower tier, so having fewer paid users is a relatively small impact.\nThe future competition for GitLab is much more likely to come from an open source project than a proprietary only product competing only with our lowest tier.\nWe can reduce the relative attractiveness of the lowest tier by open sourcing features, although this too makes it harder to raise the price of that tier.\nLots of companies don‚Äôt want to forgo support, especially in their first year, and there is little price elasticity there.\nPlease note that all the above is not a plea to add more or fewer features to lower tiers, we should just follow our\nBuyer Based Open Core model\n.\nConsistent names\nWe use the same names for SaaS and Self-Managed tiers because:\nThe feature set for our SaaS and Self-Managed offerings is largely consistent and we want SaaS and Self-Managed tiers to be as similar as possible.\nConsistent naming is easy to understand and use for our customers.\nType of sell\nA feature sell means that people want to buy the extra features. This can be done self-serve.\nA benefit sell means that people buy the business outcomes that come with fully utilizing GitLab. You need case studies, metrics like\nDevOps Score\n, and a quarterly check-in with a Customer Success Manager from Customer Success to review the status of the adoption plan. A competitive process can include a bake-off to show people are 10x faster in starting new projects with GitLab.\nA transformation sell means that people want to transform as an organization. They want to reduce cycle time by 10x and want us to help them. We do workshops with transformation consultants and define a complete, shared project.\nHybrid sales model\nThere is a big price difference between the different tiers (0$, $29, $99 per user per month, a price difference of infinite, 5x). For GitLab Inc., the majority of revenue comes from large enterprises buying the top two tiers.\nMost companies in a similar situation would focus only on the highest tiers.\nBut we want to make a our hybrid model work for the following reasons:\nWe want to keep being a\ngood steward of the open source project\n.\nThe free tier is a scalable way to create future customers.\nA 5x higher price doesn‚Äôt mean there is 5x more value, just like the Premium tier doesn‚Äôt provide infinitely more value than the gratis Free tier.\nWhen deciding between tiers, organizations should look at the ratio between how much extra value they get divided by how much extra they pay.\nIf this ratio is comfortably above 1, it makes sense to move to a higher tier.\nThe value is in making people more effective, saving time on integrating tools, driving faster time to value, and retiring other tools.\nThis should more than pay for the increased price of a tier.\nAn analogy would be Apple‚Äôs iPhone: it is twice as expensive as an average Android phone, and while it doesn‚Äôt deliver twice as much value, the extra value is worth the extra cost.\nAs\nStripe documented\n: hybrid is hard, because ‚ÄúThe most common result of attempting both models simultaneously is that only one of the models receives any traction, and (because these models weave themselves into all operations of the company) it typically strangles the other.‚Äù\nThis hybrid models is how we\nbridge the chasm\nbetween self-service and enterprise.\nCombining features in plans\nWe tried selling one feature at a time, but this was not feasible.\nAn improved version of that would be selling 7 main features, instead of 3 plans.\nExamples of main features would be: High Availability, Security, Service Desk, etc.\nThe advantages are:\nGradual upgrading to more expensive features.\nPay only for the features you use.\nAdd-ons are a common way of selling this.\nThe disadvantages are:\nIt is\nsuboptimal for both the buyer and GitLab Inc.\n.\nIt is hard for the buyer to estimate how much of each feature they will need.\nThe complexity can lengthen the sales process when buyers have to make separate tiering decisions for each group.\nFor users, it is unclear what features they can use.\nIt is not common in the industry, buyers don‚Äôt expect it, and it isn‚Äôt a boring solution (an operating principle under our\nefficiency value\n).\nThe true-up process becomes more complex.\nThe customer has to administer a process for how users can get more features.\nFeatures get less usage, and therefore the improvements are slower.\nIt is hard to do with a hybrid sales model, where there is a 25x difference between the lowest and highest paid plans.\nWe currently think the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.\nSingle plan for one customer\nThe advantages are:\nUsers can use more features from more stages uniformly. Taking advantage of the power the one DevOps application results in better ROI for the customer.\nBuyers do not have to estimate how much of each tier they will need.\nThere will not be confusion on what users can or can‚Äôt use.\nSimple pricing and true-up process.\nThere‚Äôs no increased product complexity to turn features on/off on a per user basis.\nSimpler administration: the customer will not have to administer a process to move users between tiers.\nThe disadvantages are:\nCustomers may be paying for feature they feel not enough users are using.\nMay lead to multiple instances with separate licenses for different groups.\nMore negotiation up front.\nIncreased renewal risks.\nWe believe having a single plan for one customer works because the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nFor the GitLab sales team and for GitLab customers, we suggest handling the objection by focusing on the\nvalue and business outcomes\nReporter User Permission Pricing\nAs our customers adopt GitLab as the single application for their entire DevOps lifecycle, we are hearing more and more non-developer use cases using GitLab for Agile project management. The main functionality that some non-developer roles need aligns fairly well with our\nreporter permission\naccess, including Managing Labels, Assigning Issues, and Creating and Editing Epics, etc. Those users don‚Äôt really need to use much other developer functionality.\nCurrently, we do not offer a different list price for users who only need the reporter permission because:\nThis pricing approach aligns with our\nBuyer Based Open Core model\n.\nThe list prices of our plans are blended prices with consideration for both developer and non-developer use cases.\nWe are\nselling a suite\nand taking care of specific non-developer use cases by making a discount conditional on not using part of the product.\nA simplified pricing and packaging (PnP) strategy serves customers in the optimal way per the industry best practice. More SKUs lead to a more complex PnP model as a company scales, which eventually causes huge confusion to customers.\nWe do not limit a license to the\nreporter permission\nin GitLab. Any reporter user can be updated to a regular developer user by using the same license.\nWe understand that our customers have non-developer use cases. Please\ncontact our sales team\nor connect with us via\nthis issue\nto discuss your specific use cases.\nTrue-up pricing\nWith true-up pricing, the license/sale is never blocking user growth.\nWe currently charge 100% for users added during the year, because some organizations gave an intentionally too-low estimate when we charged 50%. If we technically can count ‚Äúuser days,‚Äù we can make it fair for everyone. A pre-requisite of this would be customer adoption of\nCloud Licensing\n.\nFor customers on Cloud Licensing, we offer\nQuarterly Subscription Reconciliation\n.\nConsumption pricing principles\nThese are some principles we think are useful. These are not a promise not an entitlement. Our\npricing page\ncontains our current pricing which might deviate from the principles below.\nOur price is 5x the on-demand cost of the clouds, so we have 80% margin. This seems to be what‚Äôs common in our market (for example:\nGitHub\nand\nCircleCI\n), but we‚Äôre open to other companies fact checking us with list prices. Here‚Äôs\nour long-term cost model\nwhich shows how this enables us to get a 20% profit margin.\nThe user has the flexibility to bring their own resources whenever practical (for example, runners and clusters). This can be their on-premise equipment or from their own cloud contract.\nWe don‚Äôt want to compete with the major clouds because they are our partners. The only reasons we‚Äôd offer our own are because it needs to be in our infrastructure (repository storage) and it‚Äôs convenient for the end user (runners).\nWe reap the benefits of scale and sustained-use discounts. We use that to sponsor the resource use that isn‚Äôt priced. For example: Coordinating the runners, logging in, showing the interface, and sending emails.\nAs costs become more significant, we might start charging for it (E.g. bandwidth costs).\nWe can offer new services that make it easier to use GitLab, like for clusters that run Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and other Auto DevOps features.\nThe consumption differences between the tiers should be proportional to the price difference between the tiers for the paid plans. The free tier should have an equal difference. Currently it is 5x between all the tiers.\nWe anticipate that not all of the consumption that is included in the accounts is used.\nWe simplify the pricing model for our customers whenever we can. For example, our pricing is one fee for storage, while the underlying repository might be on a Solid State Drive (SSD) or Hard Disk Drive (HDD).\nIn the future we can offer extra credits if users do something that generates value to the company. Similar to the Dropbox ‚Äúget GBs for inviting a friend‚Äù offering. Examples: Using new stages, linking to a partner (AWS/GCP), and inviting new users.\nPrepay vs. postpay: We select prepayment since it solves non-payment problems like bitcoin miners. It‚Äôs also more predictable for users with fewer unexpected bills, so it makes budgeting easier. Postpay reduces the risk of infrastructure going down due to the lack of funds. In GitLab, most of the consumption is driven by people in the organization instead of their customers. This makes it more likely that we can get them to pay quickly when that is needed. We should think about emergency processes for enterprise customers that have long ordering cycles.\nManual vs. automatic ordering: We need both. We‚Äôll start with manual ordering since that is simpler to make, we need it anyway, and it leads to fewer unexpected bills for customers. Automatic ordering will help customers prevent their developers being ineffective because they don‚Äôt have minutes. At some point, we might change the default from manual to automatic. If we do, we should communicate this well and always give customers the option to keep it manual.\nRecurring vs. non-recurring: We will make it recurring for anything that was manually ordered and non-recurring for anything that was automatically ordered. Recurring reduces work on the side of the customers. Non-recurring reduces the chance of customers paying for consumption they don‚Äôt use.\nRefundable vs. non-refundable: We‚Äôll make it non-refundable for now, since refundable is complex to implement, has legal constraints, and makes revenue recognition harder. Refundable would be better for customers that have more consumption purchased than they need.\nSplit vs. combined pricing: Do you charge separately for storage and minutes, or do you buy a bunch of credits you can use for both? We select split pricing, because it makes it simpler to understand. The hyperclouds are also going this way with\nreserved instances\nand\nfree tiers\nare also for specific products.\nDollars vs. credits vs. native: Do we add x dollars to an account, add credits, or add compute minutes and storage GBs. We choose native since it is simplest to understand if you do split pricing. Not all minutes are the same (sizes, operating system) but we can use a multiplication factor for that. More than 95% of the minutes are of the 1x type, so native instead of credits makes it easier in most situations.\nPartial vs. full refill: We do a full refill since it is simpler to communicate, understand, bill, and administer. CircleCI does a partial refill for 25% of your normal credits.\nHow much free? We should probably do 5x less than the lowest tier since we have 5x between the paid tiers. GitHub followed our pricing so that isn‚Äôt a good source of comparison. CircleCI does 250 minutes on the free plan.\nAccumulative vs. non-cumulative:\nWe currently think the pros with the non-cumulative approach outweigh the pros with the cumulative approach.\nIt seems that per namespace is easier to communicate.\nCustomers don‚Äôt need to do calculations on the total minutes and storage they are getting when signing on contracts, renewals, adding users, etc. as long as they stay under the total it is a predictable bill.\nIt is simpler to implement, and we already have it.\nThe allotment with the plan is to get people started, not for serious consumption, that you can buy separately.\nIt looks like a bigger number of minutes and storage.\nThis gives the most to free users, for whom purchasing consumption is a big hurdle to try GitLab.\nWe need to make sure that a paid tier doesn‚Äôt benefit from free users quota.\nSome other vendors‚Äô pricing metrics are like this as well.\nIt makes more logical sense.\nIt is more fair as customers will have more minutes and storage as they sign up more users.\nIt is aligned with our tier pricing metric.\nIt incentivizes more users per namespace of which we know it drives conversion.\nIt drives free users to more quickly buy consumption and convert them into customers.\nPer user vs. per namespace: Are the consumption limits provisioned per user or per namespace?\nIn the case of per namespace, the user gets more minutes and storage when they create another namespace. In the case of per user, the user receives fixed minutes and storage across all their contributions. We currently provision consumption limits per namespace. A user namespace also receives the group namespace‚Äôs quota.\nDoes storage pricing include other storage types: attachments, containers, etc.?\nThe single storage pricing covers registry (containers are part of it), repository, artifacts, and attachments, etc.\nPricing is not a substitute for scalability. For example, putting something in a higher tier if we are worried about its scalability is not what we do. We should rather start with Beta, limited access, or mailing lists etc.\nPrice difference between self-managed and SaaS\nArguments to charge more for SaaS:\nThe costs of SaaS are higher for GitLab.\nIt is more logical in revenue recognition.\nArguments to at least make them equal:\nSelf-managed pricing tends to be higher, in general.\nThere is more market demand for self-managed.\nNo incentive for sales to sell SaaS over self-managed.\nWe want to incentivize customers to move to SaaS with us because we have more data (better customer success outcomes) and we don‚Äôt have to rewin their business when they do move from self-managed to SaaS\nNot sure what is normal in the market. Adobe did a good job, but they moved from perpetual licensing to subscriptions, where it is hard to\ncompare the two prices\n.\nWhen is a dollar not a dollar?\nThis is the title of a\ngreat article\nof which we‚Äôll apply the 8 points to GitLab below:\nCost vs. revenue: we can help both to reduce costs and increase revenue, make sure you align to what the priorities of the prospect are.\nPrinciple agent problem: for a VP of Engineering, you probably want to highlight our features that provide more visibility over features that save developers time.\nExisting expense vs. new expense: we can make use of existing budgets, be aware that multiple can apply (dev tools, security, operations, DevOps transformation).\nAbove vs. below discretionary spending limits: one more reason to have multiple pricing tiers.\nSelling services vs. customized products vs. off-the-shelf products: we‚Äôre selling a high-margin product and augment with services when needed to make the customer more successful.\nSelling to many stakeholders vs. one stakeholder: this is another reason for our multiple tiers‚ÄîPremium is sold to the single stakeholder of development teams, Ultimate is sold to multiple stakeholders and will need the CIO to enforce the transformation.\nMonthly vs. upfront payments: that is why we prioritize yearly upfront, sometimes even multi-year upfront. Also, yearly is the standard for enterprises (Salesforce sells it like this) and helps reduce support costs that are an order of magnitude greater for SaaS (most likely to be monthly) vs. self-managed.\nSelling vs. upselling: this is why we have multiple tiers.\nAnnual pricing is prioritized over monthly pricing\nAnnual, up-front pricing is currently our only offering.\nAll internal systems should show only annual pricing to keep comparisons simple.\nWe do show monthly pricing externally.\nArguments supporting annual up-front pricing:\nOn\nslide 7 of the 2020 Go To Market (GTM) Survey of Redpoint\nit showed that Annual pricing was the majority from $5k up.\nIt helps to recover the costs of acquiring, onboarding, and supporting a customer.\nIt enables reinvestment to speed delivery of new product capabilities for customers.\nIt aids customer self-selection and commitment to drive to successful deployment and enough time to see successful outcomes with the product.\nIt can be offered at a discount relative to monthly pricing.\nWe offer a wide range of product tiers, including a free tier to appeal to many customer types and free trials of any tier.\nCosts are lower for sales, billing, and customer support.\nBetter customer experience due to ongoing product availability and less frequent administration and billing contact.\nIt is much easier to enforce license entitlement only once per year and yields lower product development cost.\nIt enables a more predictable business and more up-front investment in customer success to ensure great outcomes from use of the product.\nAnnual pricing lends to a more simple revenue recognition model where consumption is not relevant since revenue is recognized evenly over the course of the term. To get the equivalent with monthly pricing you need a ‚Äòuse it or lose it‚Äô condition per month, while the industry standard is to allow carry-over into the next month.\nIt helps to reduce churn with SMB customers, as that has been a problem in the industry.\nArguments supporting also offering monthly pricing:\nMonthly billing gives customers another way to buy and thus reduces barriers to adoption of the product.\nMonthly pricing can align with billing of combined or dependent products/services that are already billed monthly. (ex: if bundled with another monthly service)\nWhy show monthly pricing on the website\nAlmost all SaaS products show monthly pricing on their pricing pages. GitLab shows\nmonthly pricing on our website\nand notes clearly that it is billed annually. This is also a standard practice followed by companies like\nSalesforce\n. We previously have tried showing annual pricing on the website, but repeatedly heard from customers that they were confused by it. They often thought our product was priced significantly higher than it actually was because they expected the pricing to be displayed in monthly units and read the annual price as though it were per month.\nOnly sell a suite\nMost companies evolve in the following way:\nSell one product\nSell multiple products\nSell multiple products and a suite of them\nOnly sell a suite\nAn example is Microsoft Office, where it is costly to buy components of Office365 separately, although higher tiers include more products.\nAt GitLab, we decided to skip the intermediate steps and immediately only offer a suite that includes all our products.\nHaving our complete scope included in our open source version is even part of our\nstewardship promises\n.\nSelling only a suite has risks, after the => is how we mitigate those at GitLab:\nLeave money on the table, if people want all products. => Offer an Ultimate tier that is great value, if you adopt everything of GitLab.\nDiscount because people don‚Äôt want all the products. => Make a discount conditional on not using part of the product.\nTiers are harder to define than if you would have separate products. => Hard to mitigate, we have to work extra hard on communicating the differences.\nNo revenue feedback from customer about what products they value more. => The product function focuses on usage data as our best proxy for value.\nCompanies evolve to selling only a suite for the following reasons, after the => is how this applies to GitLab:\nMakes it easier for organizations to adopt the other products. => This is essential; organizations have official solutions and GitLab grows with organic adoption from developers.\nShow customers the benefit of a\nsingle application\n. => This is essential, since people are skeptical (showing beats telling).\nMore usage of all the products. => This is essential for us, due to our seed then nurture product strategy.\nHarder to displace the suite, once it is in place. => This will help if competitors offer a service based on our open source code.\nWe‚Äôre going even further than selling a suite by integrating everything in a single application. We do that because of the advantages mentioned on our\nhandbook page about us being single application\n. A secondary effect is that the user doesn‚Äôt have to make a buying, or even an adoption, decision.\nCharging one price that incorporate all our stages is the\nperfect bundle\n.\nValue creation\nThere are two factors that determine how much value GitLab creates for an organization, in order of importance:\nScope: how many parts of GitLab you use, indicated by the DevOps score, how many components of GitLab are in use.\nSize: how many people work in an organization and use GitLab.\nWhen an organization is larger, the benefits of GitLab are larger because:\nCoordination takes up a greater amount of the work. 80% is coordination costs; it is much more valuable to reduce that than when it is 20%.\nHarder and more expensive to train people and enforce best practices.\nMore silos that benefit from innersourcing.\nMore cancellations, longer cycles, more time to win.\nHigher requirements for governance.\nValue capture\nSince GitLab is an open core project, we‚Äôll always create much more value then we (are able to) capture. Based on the value created, the straightforward way to capture value would be to:\nScope: charge a higher price per user the more of GitLab you use.\nSize: Charge a higher price per seat the more users you have.\nThese straightforward ways are not possible for the following reasons:\nScope: charging more for adoption would hurt the adoption of GitLab for the whole lifecycle. In January 2018, version control is 10 times more popular than the next feature (CI). We need the features to spread organically, so people can create more value with GitLab. People are much more willing to pay when they are already using a part of the lifecycle.\nSize: many other software companies limit the maximum amount of users in certain\ntiers\n. For GitLab, we can‚Äôt do this because we\npromise the open source version won‚Äôt contain artificial restrictions\n. We can do it in our proprietary tiers, but this doesn‚Äôt seem symmetrical. It also feels unfair, if you have to pay more simply by being a bit larger than the limit.\nSo we‚Äôre left with charging for features.\nWe can‚Äôt charge for each feature separately, since that is unwieldy for the customer.\nSo we charge for tiers that contain a bundle of features.\nWe select features in the (more expensive) paid tiers that:\nScope: become more useful and valuable as your DevOps score increases\nSize: become more useful and valuable as your organizational size increases\nAdding features to a (more expensive) paid tier is not the only thing stopping users from adopting them, but it is a very important factor.\nTo simplify the above, we base our feature groupings on champion position (see below).\nBuyer-Based-Open-Core\nWe make feature tiering decisions based on:\n‚ÄúWho cares most about the feature‚Äù\n.\nOur\nthree tiers\nare differentiated based on\nthe buyer persona\nor IC who buys GitLab, from individual contributor, to manager/director, to executive. Every person in the company\nis on the same tier\n, even if they don‚Äôt use all the features.\nThe feature is put in the plan based on what champion is most likely to\ncare\nabout it.\nBuyers make sense, since a higher-cost plan needs a higher-placed buyer.\nAlternatives that don‚Äôt work:\nPricing based on company size doesn‚Äôt work; some small companies need the features of the most expensive plan.\nScope and size\ndon‚Äôt work.\nPricing based on maturity is strange, because organizations at the beginning of their journey should pay the most, since in a greenfield you benefit the most quickly and extensively from GitLab.\nMore detail about this in Sid‚Äôs presentations about Buyer-Based-Open-Core at the\nOpen Source Leadership Summit in 2019\nand at\nHeavybit\n.\nAlso, see\nfork and commoditize\n(internal) in our list of concerns.\nExample template for customer response\nA customer asked why merge request approvals were not included in free:\nThanks for asking. We think that managers are more likely to care about merge requests approvals than individual contributors. That doesn‚Äôt mean that individual contributors don‚Äôt care about them. And it doesn‚Äôt mean that in all cases managers care more, just in most cases. For more information please see our Buyer Based Open Core model:\n#buyer-based-open-core\n.\nBelow is a video of the CEO talking about monetizing open source with co-founders from Infracost.io\nIf a feature can be moved down do it quickly\nWe should not hesitate to open source features. When we put a feature into too high of a tier we should move it quickly because not having it in all tiers limits who can use the feature and this hurts:\nGetting more users: having the product sell itself makes us much more efficient, for it to sell itself it has to get used, more open source features can increase the popularity of GitLab compared to rival offerings.\nGetting more\nstages per user\n(internal): if an open-source feature gets a user to adopt a new stage, the value one user gets from GitLab increases greatly because the\nsingle application\nbenefits grow exponentially when you adopt more stages.\nGetting more open source contributions to improve the feature: since the number of contributions grows with the number of users.\nIncrease demand for paid features on top of what you open source: When you move a feature down this increases the usage of the specific feature, for example our service desk functionality. When a feature is popular this creates more demand for paid features that we can add later like custom templates for service desks.\nIn most cases the following guidelines apply:\nPrioritize feature adoption in free prior to attempting to monetize it.\nIf other paid features will be within reach of more users by using this features we should probably open source it. An example is the support for multiple Kubernetes clusters that can drive adoption of adding Kubernetes clusters which allows people to use the paid feature of browser performance testing.\nIf no buyer cares about the feature, that means it isn‚Äôt the focus of any buyer, and we should open source it.\nWe should make sure that the basic features of a comparable offerings are open source. We should charge for the features that the comparable offerings charge extra for. We do need features to be open source to drive initial adoption.\nBelow is a video with the CEO discussing the philosophy of this with a Product Manager:\nDefault to move features down\nWhen in doubt, we will default to moving features to a lower tier,\nmoving it down quickly\nif\ndata shows that this is more appropriate. Not all tier changes will involve moving things to lower-priced plans and paid features may move into the higher tier, but\nopen source features should never move to paid tiers\n.\nOccasionally, a feature may unintentionally become available at a lower-tier due to a bug. This can include the free (open source) tier. When we fix the bug and return the feature to the correct tier, this is not the same as moving an open source feature to a paid tier. The definitive source for a given feature‚Äôs tier is\nour documentation\n.\nWe should focus on building new features that buyers want and making sure that the initial assessment of new features is never too low. While we reserve the\nability to move features up in tier, proving the necessity has a much higher bar since we are constraining the existing reach of a feature rather than expanding it.\nPlease also note that the CEO is in charge of pricing and tiers; this is delegated to product for the day-to-day work.\nWhile other parts of the GitLab organization are consulted, the CEO is the\ndirectly responsible individual\n.\nChanging tiers and pricing changes\nTo propose a change that impacts pricing or changes a feature‚Äôs tier (e.g. moving a feature from Premium to Free), please follow the process outlined in the\nFeature Tier or Pricing Change issue template\n.\nDevOps score is not maturity\nWhat is interesting is that GitLab creates more value as you adopt more of it.\nThis shouldn‚Äôt be confused with DevOps maturity.\nDevOps maturity is how advanced your practices are and how fast your DevOps lifecycle is, shown in\ncycle analytics\n.\nWith the best practices embedded in GitLab, you will mature faster than without it. GitLab enables a 200% faster DevOps lifecycle.\nBut DevOps maturity is mostly about organizational change. GitLab the product is just an enabler of it.\nEven if an organization uses everything of GitLab (high DevOps score), they can still have a slow process (slow lifecycle).\nWe know there is a correlation between a higher DevOps score and a faster lifecycle; but especially in organizations new to DevOps, it is a trend, not an absolute.\nLinking our tiers to maturity would mean we don‚Äôt ask any money from the large organizations that currently have a slow lifecycle but that are making it faster by adopting all of GitLab.\nThese large organizations with a slow lifecycle benefit the most from GitLab, since they can adopt it completely, because they are not held back by an existing toolchain.\nLocation based pricing\nAs suggested by\na user on X\n(X login required).\nThis is a good suggestion to consider given the GitLab approach to adapting to local markets throughout the business. GitLab will assess viability of the idea in our overall pricing strategy planning. It is difficult to do and our assessment of this will consider:\nThis is a complex issue and requires that all parties are better off if a change is made to account for geography. We fully admit that this would be hard to pull off successfully.\nIf there is a way this could be good for customers and for GitLab, we will not treat this separately. We will treat it as part of a unified pricing strategy\nIn a global and digital marketplace it is difficult to positively identify where a customer is geographically located either because we rely on that customer to self-identify or because it is a large organization with users in several geographical locations.\nWe may be able to solve with a simpler discounting policy\nAny overall reduction in cost per license must be more than made up by increased volume at the new pricing\nLast modified July 17, 2025:\nRemoves outdated strategy page (\n387298cd\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 8741}
{"doc_id": "2f6dc9ee9b2cbb3f", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-management", "title": "GitLab Product Management | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nProduct Handbook\nGitLab Product Management\nThis document describes what Product Management does, where, when, and how to engage with the product management team.\nWhat does Product Management do?\nAt GitLab, the PMs lead their specialization. That is, the Create PM decides what the Create group works on, for which release, and makes sure this furthers our goals. This includes bugs, features, and architectural changes.\nThe PM can‚Äôt be expected to parse every single bug or issue that comes by, so they have to rely heavily on the input of the various stakeholders. To be able to achieve this, both the PM and the stakeholders have to actively work together. It‚Äôs a two-way street.\nIn general terms, if you require something to happen with the product or if you need engineering staff for a particular change, you approach a PM. Preferably through creating an issue (the GitLab way), and mentioning them there.\nIn the same vein, PMs are required to ask for feedback from the stakeholder on particular changes. If a change will affect GitLab.com and its maintenance, a PM should proactively reach out to infrastructure engineers to help with the scope, design, and decisions regarding this change.\nIt is then up to the PM to weigh all these inputs and decide on a prioritization. It is to be expected that they are the best equipped to make this prioritization, while also keeping in mind all goals of GitLab.\nHow to engage Product Managers\nWhere to reach Product Managers\nPublic Issue Tracker (for Product)\n; please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to team members at GitLab.\nChat channel\n; please use the\n#product\nchat channel for questions that don‚Äôt seem appropriate for the issue tracker.\nWhich Product Manager should I contact?\nPlease see the\nProduct Categories\nto know which product manager handles which category.\nHow do I share feedback?\nGenerally speaking, all product feedback should be provided via issues. For detailed overview of how to create an issue, please\nread this section on the process\n. If you have any product-related questions, comments, input, or otherwise, the Product Manager is the primary person you should talk to,\nif creating an issue does not suffice\n.\nCreating an issue includes, but is not limited to, features, bugs, and other changes that need to be prioritized, changed, discussed, or need more attention. Product Managers will reach out to stakeholders when making or communicating any decision. The pressure of balancing priorities while ensuring we build excellent software is on the product managers and they need all the input they can get to achieve this. Paid features fall under their respective PMs, not under one PM in particular. For instance,\nService Desk\nfalls under the\nPlan PM\n.\nAll feedback must follow the\nGitLab Community Code of Conduct\n. Failure to do so will result in the issues or comment being deleted.\nCustomer feature requests\nIf a customer has a feature request that doesn‚Äôt already exist, refer to the\nprocess to create an issue\nin the\ngitlab-org issue tracker\nand choose the\nFeature Proposal\ntemplate, following the instructions and providing as much information as possible. Once you‚Äôve created the issue,  make sure to add the appropriate labels for the\nproduct stage and/or group\n(e.g\n~\"devops::plan\"\n) if known and add a comment tagging the appropriate Product Manager. If an issue already exists, make a comment on the issue with their information and use case.\nWhenever you‚Äôre sharing feedback on an issue (e.g. ‚ÄúCustomer X wants this‚Äù), please make sure to do the following:\nLink to the source. Usually, this is a link to Salesforce or Zendesk\nUse the Salesforce Account URL when it‚Äôs a paying customer and you want to relate the ARR\nUse the Salesforce Opportunity URL when it‚Äôs related to a prospect or significant growth opportunity\nProvide context: if a customer wants this feature, include\nwhy\nthey are interested in this. If you don‚Äôt know, make sure to ask or bring the relevant PM in contact with the customer\nInclude any further useful context (e.g. what kind of software is this customer building, or how they will use the feature)\nMention the\nProduct Manager\nFeel free to ask them anything that isn‚Äôt clear to you (e.g. it‚Äôs not clear what the status is of the issue, etc)\nIf a customer expresses interest by simply mentioning an issue number or e.g. ‚Äúan integration with X‚Äù, that is not sufficient information. Before creating or commenting on an issue, make sure to ask them:\nWhy do you want this?\nWhat problem are you trying to solve?\nWhat parts of this issue/integration are important to you and why?\nHave you tried workarounds?\nHow important is this to you?\nThe Product Manager is responsible for figuring all of this out, but being one step ahead of them will speed things up.\nIf a customer is a member of our Product\nCustomer Advisory Board\n, the CSM should add two labels:\n~CAB Takeaway\nand\n~CAB Takeaway Qx FY20xx\nto the issue.\nIt is highly recommended to use the feedback template below to make this easier.\nFeedback template\nYou can copy/paste this to make sure you don‚Äôt miss anything or\ncreate a comment template\nfor reusability:\n<!-- Select the appropriate subscription and product text below and remove the others (note: do not add them as labels)>\n<!-- Click on ~customer priority:: below to select an appropriate label 1 through 10 with 10 being the highest>\nThe following ~customer is interested in this capability\n-\nSubscription: ~\"GitLab Ultimate\" OR ~\"GitLab Premium\" OR ~\"GitLab Free\"\n-\nProduct: ~\"self-managed\" OR ~\"gitlab.com\" OR ~\"GitLab Dedicated\"\n-\nLink to request:\n-\nPriority: ~customer priority::\n-\nWhy interested:\n-\nProblem they are trying to solve:\n-\nCurrent solution for this problem:\n-\nImpact to the customer of not having this:\n-\nQuestions:\n-\nPM to mention:\n-\nCSM to mention:\nThe\n~customer priority::*\nlabels are inputs for the prioritization model powering the customer issue prioritization framework dashboard:\nCustomer Requested Issues\nThese dashboards represent the relative importance of a given issue to the specific customer. 1 is the lowest priority and 10 is the highest. These can be updated at any point in time and will be reflected in the model within 24 hours. You can find more context about priority labels on the\ncustomer issues prioritization framework handbook page\n.\nGood example\nA customer with more than 1000 users mentioned they are interested in this feature to be able to do their sprint planning more effectively. The problem they are trying to solve is that with the current implementation, they can‚Äôt X and need to do so because Y. They are using software X to do this today, but would be able to move to GitLab if we would do this.\n@productmanager this issue doesn‚Äôt have a milestone right now, are we planning to address this in the near term?\nBad example\nsalesforce.com/blabla\nCustomer collaboration projects\nCustomers that are assigned a Customer Success Manager typically have a\ncollaboration project\non GitLab.com, which is used to share information, document customer details, and track issues in a place that both the GitLab team and the customer‚Äôs team can access.\nGenerally, CSMs maintain a main issue and/or enable the\nCS-Tool - TAM issue tracker\n, which lists out all feature requests the customer is interested in with links to the public GitLab issue.\nWhen a customer expresses interest in a feature, the CSM should capture that in the public GitLab issue, as well as add it as an entry in the main feature tracking issue of the\ncustomer‚Äôs collaboration project\n.\nThe feature tracking issue should be maintained regularly by updating priority (elaborated on below) and milestones as the single source of truth on customer product needs. It can also be used for reviewing metrics of previously delivered feature requests.\nIf there is a lot of discussion with the customer about a specific feature request, create an issue on the customer\ncollaboration project\nabout it and list that issue as a related issue on the main GitLab issue. This is another signal of the main product issue of customer interest and also allows discussion with the customer and internal GitLab team members about their needs and concerns.\nHow do I escalate a feature request?\nIf you have followed the process of creating/commenting on issues and have not gotten traction, confirm that\nall of the necessary information is included in the issue\n. Follow up with the Product Manager again in the issue and in the product stage Slack channel (linking to the issue) to get additional attention and team member involvement.\nIf a customer has identified an issue that is high priority for them, such as a work-stoppage bug or a feature required for the customer to meet a deadline, follow the expected steps for logging and tracking customer feature requests above by adding the customer‚Äôs interest in a GitLab issue and including it in the collaboration project issue. In addition,\nreach out to the Product Manager\nwho is\nresponsible for the corresponding group\nand discuss it with them directly. A general idea of high priority is that the customer needs a particular feature as soon as possible.\nCritical Priority Requests\nare extremely rare, but, when they occur, they are agreed upon by both Product and Engineering, with the CSM facilitating the request. If a customer is unable to continue using GitLab without a specific feature, the CSM should begin the\ntriaging the account\n, follow the process to indicate customer interest in the issue, then set up regular check-ins with the Product and Engineering teams to assess the status of the feature, expectations, and potential secondary plans. For the product & engineering process, please refer to the details of a\ncritical customer merge request\n.\nWhy do product teams prefer we ask about the problem rather than the solution?\nThe following part of\nthis UX design article\nsums it up well:\nListening to the right customers at the right time is a great first start, but you also need to make sure you are interpreting their feedback/requests correctly. The reason for that is generally customers ask for something to be better, not different ‚Äî\nthey interpret their problems through existing solutions\n. A customer is unlikely to tell you what new product to create (that‚Äôs your company‚Äôs job!) but they will tell you what problem that product needs to solve.\nTo do this you need to get to the underlying why behind the feature request ‚Äî what is the basic problem to be solved, and then think about how to solve that problem in a fundamentally better (e.g., 10x faster, easier, cheaper) way.\nThis concept is best described by the (most likely misattributed) quote by the founder of the Ford Motor Company, Henry Ford: ‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù\nWhen the customer asks for a faster horse, you should then ask why. You would invariably hear things like:\nI‚Äôd like to shorten my commute from home to work\nI‚Äôd like to be able to sell my widgets to more cities\nI‚Äôd like to win the Kentucky Derby\nNow that you understand the basic problem to be solved (of which there are many solutions including a faster horse), its your job to think of a fundamentally better way to solve it\n‚Äî e.g., what does a 10x faster horse look like? And one potential solution to that is obviously a car.\nFeedback Examples\nExamples: A customer has a feature request\nIf you hear a feature request from a customer, and they do not have a CSM assigned to their account, you should follow the normal procedure: create an issue and label it correctly. Let‚Äôs say the customer requests an enhancement to Issues. You know by reading above that you‚Äôll have to label this with\nDiscussion\nand you can mention or reach out to the Plan PM to expedite this if warranted.\nA salesperson for an organization asking for a paid-tier feature request shall work with the product manager to arrange conversations to further explore the feature request and desired outcome. The process will be:\nSales schedules 1-hour zoom meeting with the product manager, customer, and themselves. Call recorded if the customer gives permission.\nProduct Manager prepares any additional questions they would like answered, beyond what is below.\nWhat version of GitLab are you currently using? CE / Premium / Ultimate?\nHow are you currently doing source code management? GitLab merge requests or another tool? How about CI/CD?\nHow are you currently doing issue management? How are you using HP ALM? Agile/Kanban? What do your sprint/iterations look like? 1 week? 1 month? 2 months?\nWhat is the integration like between issue management and source code management?\nHow do teams manage multiple repos? Does a team typically work on one repo at a time? Or do they work on multiple repos at the same time?\nSales sends questions to the customer prior to the meeting.\nMeeting is created in Salesforce.com\nSales creates a Google document for notes from previous calls with customer. Google Doc shared with product manager and sales manager\nSales and product manager schedule 15-minute pre-meeting to share what we know about the customer thus far, so as to not waste time asking questions we already know the answer to. Notes from this pre-meeting are added to the Google document.\nSales adds a link to the Google document under the account object as a note.\nIn the event that a paid customer is willing to pay for us to develop a specific feature, we should still respond as above. It‚Äôs great that they‚Äôre willing to pay for it: that means they really need it. However, we will not make a custom version of GitLab; even gitlab.com is running on GitLab Ultimate, and we move faster that way by minimizing technical complexity to determine features to follow after, it‚Äôs a trade-off to make. This doesn‚Äôt mean that ‚Äúno‚Äù is always going to stay ‚Äúno.‚Äù We keep an open mind to improvements.\nExample: Customer is looking for prescriptive advice for setting up GitLab\nFor example, they need support configuring a self-managed runner with a SaaS license.\nIf you need support with a specific customer and your Customer Success Manager is unable to configure what is being requested or you are being asked to provide very specific guidelines for use of GitLab, we suggest creating an issue using the\nProduct Support Request\n, and following the steps suggested in the issue.\nTo remain focused on\ncustomer results\nand\nefficiency\n, we recommend setting a due date on the issue in 5 business days and assigning the issue to the Product Leader of the section for triage.\nExample: Many support requests come in about a bug with CI\nSame as before, make sure an issue is made and make your case with the PM that this is becoming a problem and needs to be fixed. The PM will make sure that this is fixed or resolved in some other way.\nExample: I think creating new files is slow\nEverything in GitLab should be fast and creating files falls under the repository, so you create an issue and make the PM aware of it by mentioning it.\nThe PM in turn will investigate whether this is a general problem or one specific to GitLab.com, in collaboration with infrastructure and others, and schedule any necessary changes for an upcoming release.\nTableau\nThe Product team maintains a\nTableau dashboard\nto aggregate issues and customer interest in those issues. Information is automatically gathered from\nGitLab issues\nby scanning for Salesforce customer account links. The same dashboard can be used by Sales and CS.\nThe Tableau page automation will detect when Salesforce links are added and use the customer‚Äôs Salesforce data, such as Total Account Value and seat licenses, to add them to the page. This also maintains a customer‚Äôs privacy on public issues, since Salesforce links are only accessible to GitLab employees with proper credentials.\nReporting Bugs\nIf your customer would like to report a bug, refer to the\nexample of how to express the customer‚Äôs interest\nin an issue and use the\nBug\ntemplate, following the instructions and the same steps as above.\nYou can refer to the following steps if a medium priority bug has become stale on the Product Management\ntriage board\n. Another potentially helpful view is the\ntriage report label\n.\nFollow the same steps as for logging and tracking bugs as with feature requests, but be sure that steps to reproduce and workarounds are included whenever possible.\nProduct and CSM Collaboration\nIt is essential for the Product team and the CSM team to have a close working relationship, so that the business has a pulse on customer interests, feedback, and sentiment.\nProduct Collecting Customer Feedback\nIf you are on the Product team and seeking feedback from customers, you should consult with the Customer Success Management organization, as CSMs have direct access and regular communication with customers across all regions, tiers, use cases, and industries.\nTo request a meeting with a customer, open an issue in the\nCSM project\nand use the\nProduct Engagement\nissue template, filling out the appropriate fields. If you have a specific customer in mind that you‚Äôd like feedback from, please share the customer name in the issue and tag the CSM assigned if you know who it is (you can find this information in Salesforce if you have access; otherwise, someone else will check for you).\nThe CSM team gets notified via Slack whenever a new issue is opened, and they will respond in the issue with specific customers when they are available. If you don‚Äôt receive a response within a week (allowing the CSM to review with their customers), feel free to ping the\n@timtams\ngroup in the issue.\nCSMs Sharing Customer Feedback\nOne of the responsibilities of CSMs is collaborating with the Product team to help prioritize features by indicating demand from customers and relaying customers‚Äô use cases and experiences.\nFollowing the process described below will ensure that customer interest in features is shared with Product properly, so that Product can take appropriate action. Through following the documented process, we are able to increase our efficiences, decrease back-and-forth communication, build a better product, and get answers and resolutions to customers faster.\nProduct Joining Customer Calls\nIt can be very helpful for both Product and customers to be on a call together to discuss feedback, roadmaps, etc. Take the following steps to ensure an efficient and productive meeting:\nCollect Customer Context\nIn advance to the product call, have a conversation with the customer about expectations and their background.\nAsk the following questions, as applicable:\nWhat features and/or functionality do they want to discuss?\nHow familiar are they with those features and/or functionality?\nHave they had a demo of the features already or is this their first exposure?\nAre they actively using the features in production, in a POC, or have they not yet tried the features themselves?\nAre they more interested in an overview of the functionality that already exists or in future roadmap functionality?\nWhat are their goals for this call?\nContact the Appropriate PM\nIt is best practice to ask for a PM to join your call through the slack channel for their\ngroup or category\n. Direct messages are problematic because it is hard to loop in other PMs if the right person for the call is not included in the DM, and it limits visibility into topics that may be discussed. If you are unsure about the right group to reach out to, you can ask in the general\n#product\nchannel.\nBefore reaching out to the PM, fill out the\nPM Customer Meeting Briefing Document\nand send it to the PM along with your request. The PM will review the doc and let you know if they are able to attend the meeting. PMs may decline meeting requests if they do not receive the context doc or if it is only partially complete. We recommend sending this context along with your request at least 3 business days before the meeting. The PM will review the document and provide feedback to ask for further clarity if needed.\nIn addition, once the call is scheduled, make sure you have a detailed agenda set at least 24 hours before the call that is shared with both the customer and the Product team.\nEBR Preparation\nCSMs regularly hold\nExecutive Business Reviews\nwith their customers and often request involvement from Product Managers. When a CSM is looking for Product involvement, they will reach out to the PM (in their group Slack channel) with the date, time, and desired topic.\nThe CSM will involve the PM in preparation for the EBR, working with them to ensure expectations of content, timing, and desired outcomes are fully established.\nEBRs are usually quite long (60-90 minutes) and the product presentation is only a small portion (15-20 minutes) of the overall EBR, so the PM is welcome to only join when they will be speaking. Of course, if they want to join and/or participate in the full call, that is definitely welcome, as customers often share product feedback and requests throughout an EBR.\nRequests for Product Support\nThroughout the customer lifecycle, customer-facing teams (Support, Account Executives, CSMs, Solutions Architects, Professional Services, Renewals Managers, etc.) may need the assistance of a Product Manager. This can include a detailed discussion of our direction, and how to address specific use cases, or gaps in functionality, within an organization.\nTo ensure these requests can be quickly triaged, easily scheduled, and later tracked, there is a standardized request process based on issues.\nRequesting support from Product\nFor time-sensitive and high-impact requests, please paste a link to the issue in the\n#product\nSlack channel, and\n@mention\nthe recommended PM‚Äôs in the template.\nWorking with support requests\nWhen a support request is opened, labels will automatically be assigned to categorize the request.\nThree fields are particularly important when triaging requests:\nPriority: How time critical the request is,\nurgent\nrequests should be treated with a high priority\nImpact: Potential impact to the business, based on\ntotal contract value (TCV)\nStage: Which stage the request relates to\nAll Product Managers should ensure they are set up to receive label notifications for their respective stages:\nList the\nproduct project‚Äôs labels\nSubscribe to relevant stage labels\nGuide for Product Managers Engaging with Other Teams\nProduct group counterparts\nGitLab is designed and developed in a unique way.\nConsistent with our value of\nEfficiency\nthe product is developed with\ndirectly responsible individuals\nfrom Product, UX, Quality and Development working together.\nProduct Managers\nEngineering Managers\nUXers\nSETs\nSet\nmilestone priorities\nand define what features Engineering works on\nOwn the definition of done; decide what gets merged into Product. Prioritizes maintenance work\nProactively identify small and large strategic UX needs to aid Product Management prioritization\nOwn and identify test strategy and requirements to complete the definition of done\nAt GitLab, we develop our product for self-managed as well as SaaS-hosted customers. We realize that while we have DRIs there are many stakeholders who must have input, including Engineering, Quality, UX, Product, Security, and Infrastructure. For example, the Security team often has the deeper context of what it takes to run a secure SaaS system. Similarly, the Infrastructure team has insights into what we should build into the product to reduce toil and enable efficient, reliable, performant, and scalable systems.\nWe call this the\nProduct Group\nmodel. It is an extension of the classic quad concept at the leadership level and is currently comprised of Development, Quality, User Experience, Infrastructure, Product, and Security.\nThe Product Group can be used to facilitate a\nglobal optimization\n, including product-wide\ntechnical debt\n.\nWorking with Product Management across the company\nThere are many counterparts that PMs work with. Here are some best practices for working across the organization.\nWorking with Finance Business Partners\nIn some cases, Product Managers may have items that incur expenses toward the budget. These can be related to external vendors for research, contractors for development staffing, and infrastructure. The CProdO is the DRI for the product budget and all changes or requests for budget spend must be approved through them.\nTo request a forward-looking new budget item, open an issue in the Product project using the\nProduct Budget Request Template\nand assign it to the CProdO and manager. Budgets are planned annually and quarterly, so approval may not be immediately given because it depends on the timing of budget planning. The CProdO will bring the budget request to the next budget planning session with Finance.\nTo request approval for an increase in the expected spend for a pre-existing item, open an issue in the Product project using the\nProduct Budget Request Template\nassign to the CProdO and tag your manager. The CProdO will review, approve or decline the budget change. The CProdO will then notify the Finance Business Partner of changes for forecast updates.\nWorking with Content Marketing\nContent marketers and Product Managers can partner together when using a Blog to communicate product changes and engaging the market with thoughtful changes. See the\nblog post handbook page\nfor guidelines on when and how to start engaging Content Marketing for creating a blog post for a feature.\nWorking with Product Marketing (PMM)\nProduct marketers and managers should be joined at the hip. Just as a feature without documentation\nshould not be considered shipped, benefits of GitLab that we‚Äôre not actively talking about might\nas well not exist.\nProduct marketers rely on product managers to be guided to what is important and high impact.\nIn general, you should:\nalways mention the\nappropriate PMM\non epics and high level issues\nregularly meet/talk async with the PMM that is aligned with your product area\nproactively reach out for input when contemplating new features\ninvolve PMM as early as possible with work on important changes\nAdding Competitive Content to Use Cases\nA core element to use cases is effective objection handling against major competitors in the market. In order to effectively support this effort, a partnership between Product Marketing and Product Management to maintain adding competitor walkthroughs and competitive content to the existing use cases is critical. To date we have competitive sections on the following uses cases:\nGitOps\nIn FY22-Q2, we are taking on an effort to continually update these Tier 1 and Tier 2 use cases and are assigning DRIs, follow along this effort in\ngitlab&1446\nWorking with marketing\nWhen working on the release of larger features or new capabilities, it is important the product manager consider various aspects of the go to market plan and  inform or partner with the appropriate stable counterparts for strategic and logistical considerations.\nMarketing materials\nAs a PM you‚Äôre responsible for making sure changes you‚Äôve shipped are well represented\nthroughout GitLab‚Äôs documentation and marketing materials. This means that on\nrelease,\nfeatures.yml\nis updated, documentation is merged and deployed, and\nany existing content is updated where necessary.\nIt‚Äôs not acceptable to do this after the release. GitLab is very complex, and features\nand functions are easily missed, even those that provide significant value to customers\n(e.g. the many ways you can authenticate with GitLab).\nYou can recruit the help of the marketing and technical writing team if needed,\nbut it‚Äôs highly recommended to do small updates yourself. This takes less time\nand overhead than communicating what needs to be done to someone else.\nPages that read from\nfeatures.yml\nIt‚Äôs important to keep\nfeatures.yml\nupdated because there are a number of different pages (internal-facing and external-facing) that read from that file. These include:\nExternal\nPricing\nFeatures\nWhy GitLab Premium?\nWhy GitLab Ultimate?\nFeature Comparison\nDevOps Lifecycle\nDevOps Tools Landscape\nInternal\nSaaS vs. Self-managed\nFeatures by tier\nWorking with User Experience (UX)\nThe standard for working as a team at GitLab is the\nProduct Development Workflow\n. Product Managers and Product Designers should work together as strategic counterparts to better understand the problem and discover user needs. The Product Designer and the Product Manager will pair to understand the target audience, their challenges when using a particular feature and then designing a solution that helps users solve them.\nIt‚Äôs important to remember that User Experience (UX) does not only relate to visual features or interface design. UX is the intangible design of a strategy that brings us to a solution, so it also refers to the experience of writing code, working with .yml files, designing APIs, working with a CLI, etc. All of those functionalities are meant to be read and used by people. Involving a Product Designer into their planning and development can be highly beneficial. A guide to consider is: anytime a person is interacting with something, there is an opportunity for that interaction to be designed.\nAssessing user workflows\nAs the GitLab product matures, we know we must make important workflows easier to use through feedback-loop mechanisms as is captured in the ‚ÄúImprove‚Äù section of the\nProduct Development Flow\n. We can use the\nCategory Maturity Scorecards\nand\nUX scorecards\nas mechanisms to provide insights into how might be able to improve these user workflows.\nWhat if there is a conflict with the product direction plan and solution proposal?\nFor areas with minimal maturity, or low/internal-only adoption, iteration and quickly adapting the product is the priority. In cases where the product experience desired would take longer to implement than required for the current maturity stage, it is advised the Product Manager work with the Product Designer and/or Engineering Manager to scope an iteration plan to ensure the experience is delivered incrementally over time to provide value quickly with quality.\nFor areas with more adoption, or beyond viable maturity, we recommend using the below escalation path if there is a disagreement on the approach to solve for the product direction and experience for users/customers.\nAs a team, there may be cases where a proposal exceeds the expected time to market to achieve the optimal customer experience. As this impacts potential business results, product managers are the\nDRIs\nof the decision.\nAs DRIs, it is important to consider the input from other team members and to know when to trust in their experience and judgment. It is advised to use an\nopportunity canvas lite\n. The PM is expected to compile the canvas lite with inputs from the Product Designer and/or Engineering Manager. The PM then makes a decision after weighing input from the product designer and engineering, as appropriate. The PM should then share the decision, articulating the costs of waiting, and shipping earlier with less polish, as well as why no smaller iteration exists as part of this decision.\nIn the event that a decision is made to build something that is less polished, has a lesser user experience, or otherwise doesn‚Äôt live up to our standards of where we want this UI to end up the team should generate follow-up\nDeferred UX\nissues to be addressed in the next upcoming milestone(s).\nIf a quad member remains concerned and in strong disagreement with the decision made by the PM DRI, the quad member should exercise our\ndisagree, commit, and disagree value\n, by initiating an\nescalation\nto bring in management layers above into the decision.\nResults are the most important aspect to consider for the business and our users. If there is a perceived risk to potentially harm the business financially, reduce customer satisfaction or value, or lead to legal trouble, teammates are empowered to seek an alternative perspective for the product decision. Within the Product Division, we recommend escalating first to the management layer immediately above where the disagreement is happening for input and further escalating to PLT and ultimately the Chief Product Officer.\nWhat if your team doesn‚Äôt have a designer?\nProduct Designer assignments are listed in the team.yml file. Unfortunately, we are currently unable to assign a dedicated Product Designer for every group. Instead, Product Designers are assigned to the areas of highest business priority and will continue to provide focused support to those priorities throughout the year. Due to the limited capacity, we are also not able to do UX reviews on MRs for groups without a designer.\nIf there isn‚Äôt a designer listed for a group, then that team is expected to be self-sufficient in taking responsibility for the design needs of their product area. Product Design does not have the capacity to review complex proposed design solutions or provide design solutions for unsupported groups.\nIf you have questions or need support you can do so in the following ways:\nPMs who need to create designs can request access to Figma by creating an\nAccess Request issue\n.\nNote:\nWe cannot grant an Editor seat by requesting an upgrade within Figma. An access request issue is required.\nReview and follow the\nPajamas guidelines\n.\nIf you have a small design question, or the Pajamas guidance is not clear, reach out via the\n#ux\nor\n#ux_coworking\nSlack channel.\nIf you have a Community Contribution MR that needs a design review, follow the process for\nMR Reviews for Groups without a Designer\n.\nWorking with Product Management external to the company\nHere are some practices for how PMs work with groups outside of GitLab.\nWorking with community contributors\nProduct managers are the DRI for their group‚Äôs\nproduct direction\nwhich must include delivering on our greater company strategy of dual flywheels.\nCommunity contributions\nare a critical\npart of the product direction.\nTo support contributions product managers may consider the following guidelines:\nAim to review and respond to community contributions within 4 working days- see\nreview response SLO\n.\nContributions for well-defined\n~direction\nor\n%Backlog\nissues will be prioritised.\nFor contributions that impact user experience, following the\ncontribution guidelines\n,\nthe Product Designer for the group should review the MR and provide feedback on the MR.\nFor contributions that are for features we do not want in the product (either because\nof conflicts with our product direction, poor UX, maintenance concerns, or security reasons)\nthe Product Manager should review the MR and provide feedback on the MR so the contributor\nunderstands this feature is not being accepted by GitLab.\nIf not involved earlier, tag the PM of the group reviewing the MR before merging the MR.\nThis is to ensure that the PM stays informed about changes affecting their area and to\nallow them communicate the change via a release post, if necessary.\nRemember to practice our CREDIT values when communicating with contributors.\nProduct Internship - Best Practices\nThis document describes best practices for internship for learning with Product.\nInterning for ‚Ä¶\nProduct Management CDF and Competencies\nProduct Management Learning and Development\nThis page contains links to internal and external resources that Product Managers at GitLab can use to build their skills.\nThe Product Manager Role at GitLab\nLast modified July 17, 2025:\nRemoves outdated strategy page (\n387298cd\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 5830}

We are in business to create value for our shareholders and we want our team members to benefit from that shared success.\nThis guide is meant to help you understand the piece of GitLab that you‚Äôre going to own!  Its goal is to be more straightforward than the full GitLab 2015  & GitLab 2021 Equity Incentive Plans (the ‚Äú2015 Equity Plan‚Äù) and (the ‚Äú2021 Equity Plan‚Äù) and your stock option agreement or RSU agreement which you are advised to read, which both go into the full legal details. Please note, however, that while we hope that this guide is helpful to understanding the stock options and/or stock issued to you or RSU grants under the both Equity Plans, the governing terms and conditions are contained in the 2015 and 2021 Equity Plans and the related stock option agreement. You should consult an employment attorney and/or a tax advisor if you have any questions about navigating your stock options or RSU grants before you make important decisions.\nTwo things must happen for your stock options or RSUs to be meaningful,  for example:\nYou must meet the vesting schedule of the stock options (i.e. we have a 1 year cliff and 3 years of monthly vesting).\nRSUs are granted quarterly, with a six month cliff vest for new team members and quarterly thereafter up to 4 years.  Refresh grants vest quarterly over 4 years.\nIf a team member leaves GitLab, they have 90 days post termination to exercise their vested options. Unvested RSUs and options are forfeited upon the date of the team member‚Äôs exit from the company.\nEquity Incentive Plans\n2015 Equity Incentive Plan\nand related form agreements would cover information related to GitLab options.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nand related form agreements would cover information related to GitLab RSUs.\n2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nwould cover information related to GitLab ESPP purchases.\nStock Options\nIn the past at GitLab, we have given equity grants in the form of Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) and Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQs). It‚Äôs called an option because you have the option to    buy GitLab stock, subject to vesting terms, at the exercise price provided at the time of grant.\nThe difference in these two types of grants are, generally, as follows:\nISOs are issued to US employees and carry a special form of tax treatment recognized by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\nNQs are granted to contractors and non-US employees.\nGitLab is not giving equity grants in the form of options at this time.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nIn September 2021, in connection with our IPO that occurred on October 14, 2021, our board of directors and stockholders approved the  2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the ‚Äú2021 Plan‚Äù) as a successor to our 2015 Plan (together the ‚ÄúPlans‚Äù). The  2021 Plan authorizes the award of both stock options, which are intended to qualify for tax treatment  under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, and nonqualified stock options, as well for the award of  restricted stock awards (‚ÄúRSAs‚Äù), stock appreciation rights (‚ÄúSARs‚Äù), restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance and stock  bonus awards. Pursuant to the 2021 Plan, NQ stock options may be granted only to our team  members. Since September 2021, we have issued RSUs for grants of shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock, the vesting of which is based on the requisite service requirement. Generally, the Company‚Äôs RSUs are subject to forfeiture and are expected to vest over two to four years ratably on a combination of bi-annual and quarterly basis. For RSU Grant Cadence and Vesting please see the following\nslide deck\nSell-to-cover - RSUs\nShares are sold to pay the taxes due on the RSU vesting.  This is an automatic sale and the shares sold are based on the tax rate for your country.  For example, if 100 shares vest, and your tax rate is 30%, then 30 shares will be sold to cover the tax and the remaining shares will be placed in your E*TRADE account.  Taxation for selling of options or GitLab stock owned:\nTaxation of Ordinary Income - RSU - More Detail\nCompensation - At the time of vest for RSUs, you will recognize ordinary income equal to the cash value of the shares that vest.\nTax Liability - Your tax obligation will be based on current tax rates due at the time of vest.  A portion of the shares are sold to pay your tax liability.   For each country, your local tax rates are used.\nFor example, for U.S. team members tax withholding at the time of vest is computed using your federal supplemental tax rate (a fixed percentage), plus state and local and other applicable taxes- such as disability, FICA and Social Security.\nRemaining Shares - The remaining shares from your RSU grants are fully owned by you and deposited in your E*Trade Securities stock plan account.\n(You should always consult with your own tax advisor concerning how holding periods, capital gains and losses, and your personal circumstances may affect your taxes, and before taking any action that may have tax consequences.  Your actual taxes paid will vary depending on your personal circumstances. )\nPlease note that all tax withholding is based on tax rates provided by Baker McKenzie - You can find our current Tax Matrix\nhere\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (‚ÄúESPP‚Äù)\nWhat is an ESPP?\nAn ESPP is a benefit GitLab offers that allows team members to optionally purchase shares of their company‚Äôs stock at a discount through regular payroll deductions over specified Offering Periods.\nIn September 2021, the Company‚Äôs board of directors and its stockholders approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (‚ÄúESPP‚Äù) to enable eligible team members to purchase shares of the Company‚Äôs Class A common stock with accumulated payroll deductions and provides a 15% purchase price discount of the fair market value of the Company‚Äôs Class A common stock on the IPO date or purchase date, whichever is lower. The 2021 ESPP also provides up to a 24-month look-back period with four purchase dates in May and November of each year, and the first purchase occurred in May 2022.\nEligibility Requirements\nTeam member is employed via a GitLab entity with 50+ headcount\nTeam members work more than 20 hours per week.\nMust be actively employed at the beginning of the Offering Period to enroll\nMust be actively employed on the last date of the Purchase Period to be able to purchase\nEligible ESPP GitLab Entities\nGITLAB CANADA CORP.

(France)  - as of 2025-06-01\nChanging Contribution Amounts\nContribution increases and decreases are limited during Offering and Purchase Periods\nIncreases: Team members may not increase their contributions after the Offering Period begins.\nDecreases: Team Members  may decrease their contribution rates once during any Offering Period.\nStop Contributions\nTeam members may reduce their contribution to 0% during an offering period.\nAny prior contributions will be used to purchase shares on the scheduled purchase date.\nAt the end of the offering period, the team member will be automatically withdrawn from the offering period effective as of the day after the purchase date following the date of the request.\nTeam members would need to re-enroll as a new participant in the next open enrollment window and begin a new Offering Period  if they wish to participate in the future.\nWithdrawals\nTeam members may withdraw from the ESPP at any time and receive a refund of their withheld contributions. The refunds are processed through Payroll.\nTeam members who withdraw would need to re-enroll in order to participate in future Offering Periods.\nDetails on eligibility, enrollment, calculations, pricing and dollar value can be found at\nESPP Training Deck\nAlternate ESPP Non-US\nThe Alternate ESPP is for team members not eligible for the ESPP, mainly in PEO countries.  Team Members in the Alternate ESPP will be eligible to receive RSUs on the expected earnings as if they would have been able to participate in the ESPP.  There are no payroll deductions or contributions required. The RSUs will be automatically granted to team members as calculated by the following formula for each 6 month purchase period:  Details on eligibility, enrollment, calculations, pricing and dollar value can be found at\nESPP Training Deck\nWhat is an Offering Period?\nThe Offering Period consists of a 24-month period beginning on the applicable Enrollment Date and includes four six-month Purchase Periods.*\nTeam members can only be enrolled in one Offering Period at a time.\nYour Offering Period might be different from the one your coworker is enrolled in.\nESPP Calendar for Offering periods can be found at\nESPP Training Deck\nWhen do Purchases Occur?\nOn the respective Purchase Dates at the end of each Purchase Period. Only whole shares can be purchased.  Purchase dates are normally May 31 and November 30 of each year.\nOther ESPP references\nESPP FAQs\nESPP/RSU Vesting AMA\nGrant Levels\nRSUs and at times Option Grants (Option Grants are rare since September 2021) are determined by Grade Level. If you have any questions on what grant should be offered to a new hire, please reach out to the Compensation and Benefits team by email to\ntotal-rewards@gitlab.com\n. References and information for Grant Levels is held within the  compensation calculator.\nNote: All stock options and RSU grants are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and no grants are final until such approval has been made. The Company reserves the right in its own determination to make any adjustments to stock option grants at its sole discretion including the decision not to make a grant at all.\nPromotions\nPromotion grants are based on the differential between the new hire equity dollar value at the new grade minus the new hire equity dollar value at the current grade using the median of the compensation range. The vesting schedule for the new equity grant will align to the terms and conditions of the equity plan for\nRSUs\n.\nFormula for number of Promotion Equity Grant: (New Hire Equity Grant Dollar Value Median at Promoted Level - New Hire Equity Grant Dollar Value Median at Previous Level)\nFor example, if my current role is Backend Engineer and the median new hire equity grant dollar value grant for my role, level, and location is 20,000 USD, and I am promoted to Senior Backend Engineer and the median new hire equity grant dollar value for that role, level, and location is 40,000 USD, the calculation would be: 40,000 USD - 20,000 USD = 20,000 USD.\nThe output of this calculation will also be compared to 0.5x of the Refresh Equity Grant Dollar Value Median at the Promoted Level. If this calculation yields a higher dollar value than the standard Promotion Equity Grant Formula then this value will be used for the promotional grant value.\nRefresh Grants\nAs part of the updated\nAnnual Compensation Review process\n, eligible GitLab team members will be reviewed for a refresh grant once per year. Refresh grants use the formula above to determine the range of equity dollar value a team member may be eligible for in that cycle based on their current role/grade. Refresh grants will vest in accordance with the equity plan agreement between GitLab and the team members.\nNote: All equity grants are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and no grants are final until such approval has been obtained. The company reserves the right in its sole discretion to make any adjustments to equity grants including the decision not to make a grant at all.\nAnnual Refresh Grant Program Eligibility\nTeam members may be eligible to participate in the annual refresh grant cycle review if they have completed six months of service with the company. However, participation will be based upon individual team member talent assessments (including if a team member is currently in good standing) and\nkey talent criteria\n. Therefore, not all team members will receive a refresh grant in the annual review cycle. Leaders will have discretion on the size of the refresh grant based on talent assessments and equity budget as allocated to each E-group member‚Äôs division. All proposed grants will be reviewed by the People team for pay equality. All proposed equity grants are subject to review and approval by the GitLab Board of Directors.\nOption Vesting\nVesting means that you have to remain employed by, or are otherwise a service provider to, GitLab for a certain period of time before you can fully own the stock under your stock option grant. Instead of giving you the right to purchase and own all of the common stock under your stock option on day one, you get to own the stock under your stock option in increments over time. This process is called vesting and different companies offer vesting schedules of different lengths. At GitLab, our standard practice is to issue options with a four year vesting schedule so you would own a quarter of your stock after 12 months, half of your stock after two years, and all of it after 4 years. Vesting happens on a monthly basis after the first year for new hire grants and monthly after grant for refresh grants. A cliff on a new hire grant is the period at the beginning of the vesting period where your equity does not vest monthly, but instead vests at the end of the cliff period. At most companies, including GitLab, this cliff period is generally one year. This means that if you leave your job either voluntarily or involuntarily before you‚Äôve worked for a whole year, none of your options will be vested. At the end of that year, you‚Äôll vest the entire year‚Äôs worth (12 months) of equity all at once. This helps keep the ownership of GitLab stock to team members who have worked at the company for a meaningful amount of time.\nRSU Vesting & Grant Cadence\nRSUs are grants of shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock, the vesting of which is based on the requisite service requirement. Generally, the Company‚Äôs RSUs are subject to forfeiture and are expected to vest over two to four years ratably on a combination of bi-annual and quarterly basis. New hire grants vest after 6 months, quarterly thereafter over the 4 years.  Refresh grants vest quarterly over 4 years.\nPer our\nSAFE framework\n, we do not add specific dates to the handbook regarding equity. For more information on grant cadence & vesting, please see the following\nslide deck\n.\nRSUs begin vesting on the corresponding grant date.\nRSUs are reviewed for approval quarterly.\nNew Hire: 12.5% vest after ~6 months (depending upon grant date - some new hires may wait a bit longer); remaining RSUs vest quarterly thereafter for 3.5 years (four-year total vest).\nPromotion and Refresh Grants do not require a cliff, begin vesting quarterly for four-year vest.\nExercising Your Options\n‚ÄúExercising your options‚Äù means buying the stock per your option agreement. You pay the exercise price that was set when the options were first granted and you receive stock certificates back. To give team members an opportunity to benefit from any existing tax incentives that may be available (including under the US the Dutch tax laws and tax laws of your country of residence) we have made the stock immediately exercisable. This means you can exercise your right to purchase the unvested shares under your option to start your holding period. However, the Company retains a repurchase right for the unvested shares if your employment or other services ends for any reason. An early exercise of unvested stock may have important tax implications and you should consult your tax advisor before making such a decision.\nWhile the company has the right to repurchase the unvested shares upon your termination of services, the company is not obligated to do so. Accordingly you could lose some or all of the investment you made. Because we are a young company there are lots of risks, so be aware and informed of the risks.\nYou may exercise and hold your options even outside of an open trading window. If you are a Designated Insider, please email\nstockadmin@gitlab.com\nand they will enable you to do so in your E-TRADE account. Team members will have 5 trading days to execute their exercise. Please seek advice from your financial advisor or tax advisor prior processing your exercise.\nE-TRADE: Exercising your Shares in an Open Trading Window\nFor trading in an open trading window, please find the following instructions for specifics on exercise and trading options.\nGitLab Stock Plan Non-US\nGitLab Stock Plan RSUs & Stock Options\nPurchasing GTLB Stock\nIf you would like to purchase GTLB shares, this must be done through your E*TRADE retail account during an open trading window.

During this window you would have to pay the exercise price and in some cases the tax on the gain in value of your stock options, which could be considerable.\nEquity Administration\nAdministration of (i.e. RSUs, stock options, ESPP share transactions) and equity grant transactions at GitLab are conducted on the ETrade platform.  Equity Grants are approved by the Board of Directors ‚Äúor their designee‚Äù at regularly scheduled quarterly board meetings, which contain  information relevant to the grant including the number of shares, exercise price, vesting period and other key terms. This information is then recorded in your account at ETrade. New participant grants, will need to accepted the Grant Agreements in ETrade document under ‚ÄúGrant Acceptance‚Äù under the Plan Elections section in your E-TRADE account. Please see\nGitLab Stock Plan RSUs & Stock Options\n.\nWith the implementation of WorkDay, interfaces to ETrade provide for electronic files for status updates to participants, such as terminations and change in Cost Centers.\nTaxes\nTax law is complex and you should consult a tax attorney or other tax advisor who is familiar with startup stock options before making any decisions. Please go to the\ntax team‚Äôs stock options\npage for more information on taxation of stock options.\nUS employees with Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)\nTaxation from the US perspective is not as straightforward as you might like. You aren‚Äôt taxed when you exercise your options. Tax is due on the gain or profit you make when you sell the stock. Depending on your holding period, the tax may be treated as ordinary income or capital gain. Moreover, when you hold the options long enough you may be subject to 0% capital gains tax. To outline the five possibilities of the different scenarios that may apply:\nExercise your options to purchase shares, and hold.\nExercise your options to purchase shares, and sell the shares within the same year.\nExercise your options to purchase shares, and sell the shares in less than twelve months, but during the following year.\nSell shares at least one year and a day after you exercised the options, but less than two years from the original grant date.\nSell shares at least two years from the original grant date.\nPlease note, however, that any gain upon exercise of an ISO (difference between the exercise price and fair market value at date of exercise), even if you do not sell the shares, may be counted as a ‚Äútax preference‚Äù towards the Alternative Minimum Tax limit. For instance, under scenario 1 above you have to make an adjustment in your tax return for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) that equals the so-called bargain element. Each scenario has a different tax treatment, so be careful of the tax consequences when you exercise your options. In the long term, holding onto your stock does save taxes, however be aware of the AMT that you will be confronted with. It is strongly advised that you contact a tax advisor to be aware of the US tax consequences.\nIn addition to the benefits of a longer holding period, the IRS does have an additional benefit for holders of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS for short). GitLab meets the criteria for QSBS treatment for options exercised prior to August, 2018, however (again), the Company is not in a position to offer tax or legal advice nor does it make any representation about compliance with the QSBS provisions, so check with your own tax and financial advisors. We found\nthis article\nhelpful  in describing the QSBS program in greater detail.\nUS service providers with Non-qualified Statutory Options (NQs)\nFor non-employees of GitLab that have been granted stock options, their stock options are treated as NQs.\nGitLab‚Äôs stock is actively traded on NASDAQ, the NQ is taxed at exercise. The gain of the exercise (fair market value minus the exercise price) has to be reported by form\n(box 7). Withholding is typically not required, however when the service provider fails to provide a valued tax identification number in form 1099, GitLab has to ensure backup withholding (roughly 25%).\nNetherlands, Germany and Australia\nFor our team members based in the Netherlands, Germany and Australia, the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value is considered taxable at the date you exercise your stock options. With respect to reporting taxes: the taxable gains are subject to employer tax withholding. The tax payable is therefore deducted from your gross payroll with respect to the exercise of your stock options.\nThe United Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom there is a small difference in the tax treatment of exercising your stock options as opposed to the other entities; the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price is taxed at the date of exercise.\nDual-Class Stock\nOften companies will create multiple classes of stock, with each class having different voting rights, in order to provide protection to the company‚Äôs founders, early investors, and early employees, whose long-term vision for the company may not align with that of later stage investors. At the GitLab Board of Directors meeting held on January 31, 2019, the Board approved the creation of such a dual-class structure.\nEffect of Dual-Class Stock\nClass B stockholders retain significant influence over stockholder votes and actions.\nThe Influence of long-term Class B stockholders increases as other stockholders from before being public sell or distribute their Class B stock, which converts into Class A common stock upon sale or distribution.\nDual-Class Voting\nClass A Common Stock - 1 vote per share\nClass B Common Stock - 10 votes per share\nCreation of Dual-Class Stock\nBeing Public\nClass B converts to Class A in sale or distribution unless ‚Äúpermitted transfer‚Äù (see below).\nAdditional sales of Class A common stock.\nPermitted transfers would be transfers to one or more family members, transfers to a trust for the benefit of the stockholder or in favor of a family member of the stockholder, or transfers   to a general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability corporation, or other entity controlled by the stockholder or a family member of the stockholder.\nLast modified May 20, 2025:\nReplace ESPP Eligible Entities with Official Names (\nd7330f5f\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 4083}

The Data Team is also responsible for the enterprise data strategy, building\nenterprise-wide data models\n, providing Self-Service Data capabilities, maintaining the\ndata platform\n, developing\nData Pumps\n, and monitoring and measuring\nData Quality\n. The Data Team is responsible for data that is defined and accessed on a regular basis by GitLab team members from the\nSnowflake Enterprise Data Warehouse\n. The Data Team builds data infrastructure to power approximately 80% of the data that is accessed on a regular basis. The Data Team also provides a Data Science center of excellence to launch new advanced analytics initiatives and provide guidance to other GitLab team members.\nFunction Analytics Teams\nreside and report into their respective divisions and departments. These teams perform specific analysis for business activities and workflows that take place within the function. These teams perform ad-hoc analysis and develop dashboards based on the urgency and importance of the analysis required, following the\nData Development\napproach. The most important and repeatable analysis will be powered by the centralized\nTrusted Data Model\nmanaged by the central Data Team. Function Analytics Teams also build function-specific/ad-hoc data models and business insights models to solve for urgent and operational needs, not requiring trusted data features. Function Analytics Teams work closely with the Data Team in a variety of ways: expand GitLab‚Äôs overall analytics capabilities, extend the\nData Catalog\n, provide requirements for new Trusted Data models and dashboards, validate metrics, and help drive prioritization of work asked of the Data Team. When data gaps are found in our business processes and source systems, the team members will provide requirements to product management, sales ops, marketing ops, and others to ensure the source systems capture correct data.\nData Program Teams\nThe GitLab Data Program includes teams focused in the following areas:\nCustomer Success Operational Data Team\nEnterprise Data Team\nFinance Analytics & Insights\nMarketing Strategy and Performance\nMarketing Web Analytics\nPeople Analytics Team\nProduct Data Insights\nAnalytics Instrumentation Group\nSales Analytics\nHow Data Teams Work Together\nOn a normal operational basis, the Data Team and Function Analyst teams work in a ‚ÄúHub & Spoke‚Äù model, with the Data Team serving as the ‚ÄúHub‚Äù and Center of Excellence for analytics, analytics technology, operations, and infrastructure, while the ‚ÄúSpokes‚Äù represent each Division or Departments Function analysts. Function analysts develop deep subject matter expertise in their specific area and leverage the Data Team when needed.  From time to time, the Data Team provides limited development support for GitLab Departments that do not yet have dedicated Function Analysts or those teams which do have dedicated Function Analysts, but might need additional support. The teams collaborate through\nSlack Data Channels\n, the\nGitLab Data Project\n, and ad-hoc meetings.\nclassDiagram\nSales : +Sales Analyst\nMarketing : +Marketing Analyst\nProduct : +Product Analyst\nEngineering : +Operations Analyst\nEngineering : +Infrastructure Analyst\nFinance : +Financial Analyst\nPeople : +People Analyst\nData : +Data Analyst\nData : +Analytics Engineer\nData : +Data Engineer\nData : +Data Scientist\nData : +Data Quality and Governance Analyst\nThe Data Platform & Architecture Team\nThe\nData Platform Team & Architecture Team\nis part of the Enterprise Data Team and focuses on building and maintaing secure, efficent, and reliable data systems\ndata infrastructure\n.

This indicator is currently measured based on Monte-Carlo data, according to the configured (automatic) monitors on any given table in the\nraw\ndata layer.\nData Governance and Data Quality\n% improvement in data quality metrics\n% data assets enriched with metadata\n% reduction in time to discover data\nData Adoption\nData Monthly Active Users (DMAU): DMAU Measures the direct usage of the Data Platform by GitLab Team Members based on usage of the primary analysis tools we provide: Snowflake and Tableau. Over time we will include additional tools such as Jupyter and Data Studio, as well as usage of data pumped into EApps such as Marketo (PQLs), Gainsight (Usage Data), and Salesforce (Propensity Scores). A visualization of these numbers can be found in the\nData Monthly Active Users\nreport.\nData Monthly Active Users (DMAU) = Unique users of a Data system (i.e. Snowflake, Tableau) in a given month\nData Maturity Score: measured annually, evaluates our current data maturity against 8 data capabilities:\nStrategy & Approach\nCulture & leadership\nMetrics & KPIs\nOrganization & Skills\nArchitecture & Integration\nGovernance & Quality\nDeployment & Usage\nTechnology & Operations\nNumber of certified Tableau dashboards\n% total views from certified dashboards\nRevenue/Efficiency Impact\nFirst we have the evaluation criteria known as Dollar Value of our Results as calculated by the Data Value Calculator. We can use the\nData Team Value Calculator\nto calculate the dollar value of the initiatives we contribute to and the issues we complete.\nAdditionally we want to shift to a more aspirational measurement which is to measure the ARR impact or efficiency gain from each of our data products. Our data science models will be measured in the following ways:\nPropensity to Expand (PtE) and Purchase (PtP) - We will evaluate two metrics: 1) Incremental revenue impact 2) # of leads generated that are not currently in the sales funnel\nPropensity to Churn (PtC) - We will evaluate two metrics: 1) # of high propensity to churn customers that didn‚Äôt churn 2) Incremental revenue impact\nHow To Connect With Us\nPrimary #Data Slack Channel\nIssue tracker\nGitLab Unfiltered Data Team Playlist\nData Slack Channels\n#data\nis the primary channel for all of GitLab‚Äôs data and analysis conversations. This is where folks from other teams can link to their issues, ask for help, direction, and get general feedback from members of the Data Team.\n#data-team\nis where Data Team announcements are made.\n#data-daily\nis where the Data Engineers track day-to-day productivity, blockers, and fun. Powered by\nGeekbot\n, it‚Äôs our asynchronous version of a daily stand-up, and helps keep the Data Engineers aligned and informed.\n#data-lounge\nis for links to interesting articles, podcasts, blog posts, etc. A good space for casual data conversations that don‚Äôt necessarily relate to GitLab.

These views are split per use-case for your convenience. The KPIs for managing these leads are thoroughly outlined in our\nSLAs page\n.\nSDR Lead Views\nView\nDescription\nS1 - High Priority View\nThese are leads that are marked as High Priority because of some high Propensity To Purchase indication.\nS1 View\nThese are your net new leads that have scored high enough to reach MQL status.\nS2 View\nThis is a view of your existing leads that also have an associated phone call so you can easily reference your callable pipeline.\nS3 View\nQualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls. Each lead needs to either be active in a follow-up Flow, have an active task, or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future ‚Äúlast activity‚Äù date.\nBDR Lead Views\nView\nDescription\nFY26 B1 - My Leads, Action Needed\nIncludes any leads that we have committed to follow up on ASAP. These are our highest converting leads and are a mix between High Priority and MQL‚Äôs PTP is now part of our scoring so there may be leads in there that have MQLd due to PTP so you‚Äôll have to click into the lead to see more. High Priority leads belong to a High Priority campaign - you can find which one at the bottom of the page in the campaigns section.\nFY26 B2 - AWA leads w/ LIM\nIncludes leads in your name and that match to your Actively Working Accounts. It‚Äôs best to sort these by Last Interesting Moment Date and consider the Lead Classification Score when deciding which one to add to Groove Flow. We do not surface leads that were added to Flows in the last 14 days.\nFY26 B3 - Change Owner AWA‚Äôs (Clone)\nThis view however allows you to see leads that may not have been moved into your name because at the time, they did not meet criteria. These could be bc: the leads were in lead statuses of: Accepted, MQL, or Qualifying when you moved the account into Actively Working since leads with those statuses should stay with the owner currently working them.\nFY26 B4 - My HT Leads W/ Phone\nThis view should be used when either you do not have enough daily call tasks in Groove to hit your daily KPI or when your team wants to do a call blitz etc. It allows you to easily pull into Groove and create additional call tasks for your leads currently in high touch flows.\nFY26 B5 - My Qualifying Leads\nThese are leads in qualifying status which means some sort of two-way engagement happened between you two.\nFY26 B6 - 6QA Imported Leads\nleads in your ownership related to accounts that have just hit 6QA status in this view. 6QA means the account has been shown to have high intent signals and has similar signs to other accounts that have purchased from us. We have brought in appropriate titles from ZoomInfo so that when you move the 6QA account into Actively Working, you have some leads all ready for sequencing.\nFY26 B7 - AWS Prospecting Last 7 Days\nThese are leads in qualifying status which means some sort of two-way engagement happened between you two.\nFY26 B8 - AWA Leads w/ no LIM\nThese are leads in Recycle Queue status with Last Interesting Moment dates older than 12 months which means they were previously engaged but have been inactive for an extended period.\nContact Views\nView\nDescription\nB1 View\nIncludes MQL‚Äôs, Hot contacts that require quick follow up. NOTE: Not all of these contacts will be in your Actively Working Accounts list as all contacts where you are BDR Assigned on account are in your ownership, so please ensure that you set the account BDR Prospecting Status to Actively Working if you engage in discussions with the contact so that you can continue working the account and expand your outreach, otherwise any new lead MQLs for the account will route to the SDRs .\nB2 View\nContacts related to Actively working accounts that you can choose to add to Flow\nB3 View\nActive leads in HT Flows that have a phone number - to help with call downs\nB4 View\nQualifying leads. Contacts that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either on email or through phone calls. Each contact in this status needs to either be active in a follow up Groove Flow, have an active task or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future ‚Äúlast activity‚Äù date.\nAccount Views\nView\nDescription\nB1 - My BDR Assigned accounts (clone)\nCustomize to show accounts where you are the BDR assigned. Use to mass update ‚ÄòBDR Strategy‚Äô and ‚ÄòBDR Prospecting Status‚Äô.\nB2 - My Actively Working accounts (clone)\nCustomize to show ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù accounts where you are the BDR assigned.\nB3 - My Actively Working accounts (clone)\nCustomize to show ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù accounts where you are the BDR assigned.\nB4 - BDR Recycle Date Past due (Clone)\nShow AWA accounts where the Recycle Date is in the past two weeks.\nB5 - Mvd to ‚ÄúWorkedinFY‚Äù this week (Clone)\nShow Worked in FY accounts with a recent Recycle Date.\nHow to do Lead Database Management\nAs part of your SDR responsibilities, you are expected to perform due diligence on each lead you receive. This includes checking the database for duplicate records, as well as referencing against our\nRoE\n.\nOpen the lead you want to investigate and press the\nFind Duplicates\non the top of the lead‚Äôs record.\nCheck through all the records that show up, from leads to Acccounts. Make sure to search for\nDomain\nand\nLast Name\nif the data you have seems incomplete.\nCheck the\nMatched Account Info\nsection on the lead record.\nFor SMB leads, if there‚Äôs a matched account where the type is\nCustomer\n, please press the\nConvert\nbutton at the top of the lead page and match this lead to the existing account.\nIf there‚Äôs not a customer record but you find an existing open opportunity, update the\nLead Status\nto\nRecycle\nand\nRecycle Reasons\nto\nEvaluating.\nFor Universities/Education leads (non-US Pub Sec), work as regular lead if technical contact.\nIf there‚Äôs a matched account, check if the field\nBDR Prospecting Status\nis\nActively Working\nand, if so, reroute the lead to the team mentioned on the\nBDR Assigned\nfield.\nIf the existing account is not marked as\nActively Working\n, check for duplicate leads or contacts and merge if necessary while keeping the oldest\nInitial Source\n.\nIf the\nCompany Address\nfields on the lead record do not match your research online of the company, please update the\nAdmin Company Override fields\nthat are found in the\nLead/Contact Review Admin\nsection. As a further fail-safe step, you‚Äôll be asked to verify that this due diligence is done prior to converting this person to a new account.\nIf there‚Äôs no matched account, but there‚Äôs another lead at same company that has the\nstatus, assign both leads to the owner with the earliest\nMQL Date\n.\nIf there‚Äôs no matched account, but there‚Äôs another lead that has the\nAccepted\nor\nQualifying\nstatus, assign the new MQL to the owner of the accepted/qualifying leads.\nBDRs receiving leads not associated with\nActively Working\naccounts must assign back to SDR team or chatter mktgops support.\nQualified leads associated with ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù accounts are routed to BDR assigned to the Actively Working Account.\nTelco and Finserv Routing\nFor leads that connect to companies that operate in the Financial Services (AMER only) and Telecommunications (EMEA only) industries. We have a seperate routing process that supercedes all of our current\nRules of Engagement\n.\nOnly named TELCO/FinServe accounts are rolling up to the TELCO/FinServe territories. If a new account is a subsidiary of an existing carved company, it will need to be assigned to the AE owning the ultimate account. If it is a totally separate entity then it can be allocated to the regional AE. If a lead comes in that is related to a TELCO/FinServe account, it must be assigned to the BDR assigned on the account.\nCompany Address Based Routing Information\nIn\nthis video\n, a member of the Marketing Ops team goes over the Company address fields and how they are used for Accounting Routing and Opp assignment.\nIf you need to do edits to the database by merging leads together for any of the above steps, please reference the videos below for an explanation.\nSDR Territory Map\nMerging Leads\nHow to Merge Leads Together\nHow to Merge a Lead and a Contact Together\nChatter Guide for Troubleshooting\nIf you‚Äôd like the assistance of another person or team, you can use SFDC chatter on the lead record. Please reference the guide below:\nProblem\nWho to Chatter\nA SMB/MM Contact Request and the account is a customer\nChatter the Account Owner and inform them of the context of the message.\nA BDR receives an MQL Lead that is not from an Actively Working Account\nChatter @mktops\nIf you feel a lead has been misrouted\nChatter @mktops\nThere is a Duplicate Account\nChatter Sales Support and ask them to merge the accounts.\nAn Opp has moved into Stage 1 but has Incorrect Data\nChatter your manager who will then reach out to someone in Sales Dev Operations.\nUnclear Territory Assignment\nChatter an AE from each of the potential territories.\nRequesting SAO Credit on an Opp\nChatter Sales Dev Ops or the Director of Commercial Sales Development.\nAccount is in Restricted Status\nChatter the SAE and ask permission to reach out.\nCleaning Poor Leads\nLastly, Every so often you may be assigned a lead that has no value to GitLab and is not worth keeping within our database. Qualities that define these types of leads include:\nStep\nDescription\nIdentify leads with no value to GitLab\nLook for leads with characteristics such as incoherent or obviously forged information, or email addresses from temporary domains that self-terminate.\nVerify lead removal necessity\nEnsure that the leads meet the criteria for removal and are unlikely to provide any value to GitLab.\nAdd leads to the SPAM DELETION Salesforce campaign\nAdd the identified leads to the SPAM DELETION campaign in Salesforce. Make sure to be 100% certain about the removal, as this process is irreversible.\nNote campaign membership, not status\nRemember that only campaign membership matters for this process, so the campaign member status used when adding to the campaign does not affect the removal process.\nUnderstand the permanence of lead removal\nRealize that leads removed through this process cannot be recovered by MktgOps, making the removal permanent. Exercise caution when initiating lead removals.\nBe aware of the removal schedule and exceptions\nNote that the removal process occurs daily at 12:05 am PDT via Marketo. For unscheduled removals, request assistance in the mktgops Slack channel but minimize requests.\nRequest email domain blocking if necessary\nIf you observe multiple leads with the same domain, create an issue with Marketing Ops to add the domain to a block list, preventing future occurrences.\nHow to action your leads\n1. Determining High-touch or Low-touch Groove Flow usage:\nDetermine if the lead qualifies for a high touch or low touch Flow.\nHigh touch Flows are for higher-quality leads and require more personalization and touch points, including phone calls and LinkedIn Connect requests. This should be the majority of your pipeline.\nLow touch Flows are typically automated and run for a shorter period of time. You can use Low-touch for leads where a phone number cannot be found online or in our databases, or where their contact information is incomplete and cannot be enriched by our tools, or through manual research. Low touch should only be reserved as the last resort.\nResearch the appropriate Groove collections for relevant collateral to be used. Most typically our High-Touch Collection or Low-Touch collections.\nCold-Calling and Email Checkbox\nBefore calling any Lead or Contact, BDRs must ensure that the\nDo Not Call\nbox is unchecked.  If you speak to any anyone, including prospects and existing contacts, who ask you not to call them again, you must check this box. However, please do not delete the number as we need to know which number requested not to be called again. For any individuals who are opted-in to email, you may ask them if they wish to be called. If they express a desire to be called, you are then permitted to uncheck the\nDo Not Call\nbox if it was previously checked.  Also, if an individual expresses independently via email a wish to be called, you may uncheck the\nDo Not Call\nbox.  This email must be present in SFDC as proof of your authority to uncheck this box.  You cannot send email requests to individuals not opted-in to email asking whether they would like to be called.\nOur cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.\nTo be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:\nDifferent Geographical Business Cultures\nPersonality Type as per the DISC model\nIndividual‚Äôs Role and Responsibilities\nBusiness‚Äô Needs and Objectives\nAn unsubscribe link must be included on every email sent by a BDR, including responses to a prospect or contact. Please reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help for the recommended language that should appear at the bottom of each outbound email.\nDo Not Call and Do Not Email Automations\nLeads with certain criteria will be automatically labeled as\nDo Not Call\nand or\nDo Not Email\nshortly after loading into our database. It‚Äôs understandable this can be frustrating for certain territories. Please keep in mind, the criteria behind this automation has been set in order to follow local law. Please see the\nInternal GitLab handbook\nfor more information on the triggers.\nHow to Enroll to Groove by Clari\nGroove\nis a tool used to automate emails in the form of flows. Users can track open rates, click-through rates, and response rates for various templates, and update flows based on these metrics. Groove also helps to track sales activities such as calls. All emails/calls/tasks made through Groove are automatically logged in Salesforce with a corresponding disposition. See below for instructions on how to enroll leads in Groove:\nGo to your SDR views in Salesforce and select the lead you want to add to a flow.\nPress\nAdd To Groove Flow\n.\nWork from the Groove extension on Chrome to select the flow you want to enroll the lead in by using the labels feature.\nOnce the first step of a Groove flow is complete, the lead status will automatically change from\n,\nInquiry\n, or\nRaw\nto\nAccepted\n, marking that you are actively working on this lead.\nWhen a lead responds to your outreach, their status will automatically change from\nAccepted\nto\nQualifying\n. Manage these leads from your S3 and B5 lead views.\nIf you are not actively qualifying this lead further, manually change the status to\nRecycle\n, so the lead is returned to the Marketing recycle pool and isn‚Äôt stuck in your\nMy Qualifying\nview.\nIf you speak with the lead by phone and are qualifying them, manually change the status from\nAccepted\nto\nQualifying\n.\nWhen reviewing your\nQualifying\nview, add leads with no recent activity, no active tasks, and not currently in a flow into one of our follow-up Groove Flows under the\nMOTION: Follow-Up\ncategory.\nTasks and pipeline management can be done via Groove‚Äôs\nActions View\n.\nIn the Actions View, review the list of leads assigned to you by navigating to the play-icon button for each to start their corresponding action for the day.\nIf a lead completes a Groove flow without responding, the lead status will automatically change to\nUnresponsive\nor\nRecycle\nafter seven days of no response.\nManually change the lead status if you do not use a Groove flow to reach out or if you need to disqualify a lead (e.g., for bad data).\nIf you mark a lead as\nInactive\nor a contact as\nInactive\n, signifying that this person no longer works at the company, any running Flow will automatically be marked as finished.\nIf your leads are being reassigned to the\nInquiry Queue\n, it‚Äôs likely due to a scheduled cleanup job in Traction that updates\nStatus = Inquiry\nto\nInquiry Queue\n. To resolve this, add your leads to a Groove flow.\nNote:\nThe cleanup job runs daily at 10:30 PM EST/EDT.\nGroove Labels\nWe‚Äôve organized our\nGroove Labels\ninto key categories like\nindustry, region, play/motion\n, or\nlanguage\nto help you efficiently retrieve the most appropriate content quickly.\nHow to Use Groove Labels\nOn the top-hand of the\nflows page\n, access the filter menu and search per\nlabel\n.\nIndustry\n: Industry-specific labels that group flows per similar sectors.\nRegion\n: Flows organized by geographical regions, enabling you to target leads with more region-appropriate cadences based on local business culture.\nPlay/Motion\n: Each label within this category represents a specific sales play or marketing motion. These labels help you align leads with the appropriate strategy based a company‚Äôs and customer‚Äôs identified value-drivers.\nLanguage\n: Language-based labels to ensure that you can easily find non-English collateral for our global audience.\nGroove Templates\nWe‚Äôve organized our\nGroove Templates\nin the same way as our\nGroove Labels\n‚Äîby\nindustry, region, play/motion\n, and\nlanguage\n‚Äîto streamline your outreach efforts. These templates provide consistency and efficiency, and need to be created regardless if you‚Äôre sending one-off messages or using templates to structure a flow.\nWe currently have one master SalesDev folder for saving templates, please ensure that any templates that you create are saved under that folder, and tagged with the appropriate collection as per the logic outlined above.\nIn both cases, it‚Äôs essential to tag your templates with the appropriate collection name to maintain consistency and help others easily locate them for future use.\nNew Groove Flow creation\nPlease follow the instructions on\nthe Groove handbook page here\nImplement Measurement Clarity and Decision Velocity\nBy dogfooding GitLab we have a structured and simplified cadence of quantifying Flow creation in terms of value and results without limiting agency.\nMaintain Equal Contributions in a Shared Reality\nBy maintaining a Single Source of Truth (SSoT) we give the best possible forum for cross-functional collaboration with specific guidelines\nFollow Up Groove Flows\nFor SDRs and BDRs managing leads in their qualifying views, we‚Äôve created\nthis video\nto guide you through using follow-up Groove Flows.\nPlease visit the Groove Flows page and search for the tag\nMOTION: Follow-up\nto review your available options.\nWhite Glove Event Follow Up Flows\nFor more personal events, such as Executive Roundtables, there may be more detailed Last Event Notes that include a request to involve people who interacted with the prospect at the event. For these situations, we have specialized white glove Flows. These can be found by searching for the tag\nMOTION: White Glove\nThe goal of these Flows is to reach out to the prospect quickly and to include our SAEs/AEs in the conversation.\nThe first step is to add the prospect to the Flow. Then, customize the first email step to include the individuals mentioned in the Last Event Notes. You can also delay the first email to allow time for feedback from the SAE/AE if needed.\nNext, send a screenshot of the first email step to the SAE/AEs who will be CC‚Äôd. Explain that this strategy allows them to engage with more personalized messaging if the prospect remains unresponsive.\nNote:\nThere is a generic task on Day 12 to follow up with the SAE/AE if there has been no engagement. The goal is to keep them informed and work together to engage the prospect.\nHigh Priority Campaigns and Leads\nA High Priority Lead is a lead that is related to a high priority campaign. Any campaign checked as High Priority will have any members that relate to Actively Working accounts marked as High Priority irregardless of their lead status. These will show up in the BDR‚Äôs B1 priority view. Check the high priority timestamp and high priority reason fields in salesforce to understand why a lead was marked high priority.\nIf you need to move a lead out of high prioriy without contacting them you can\nuse this flow.\nThis flow is one generic task for you to complete that will move the lead to accepted status and remove the high priority check.\nTranslating Groove Flows\nFor translating flows to different languages, other than English, the Sales Dev Team will be partnering with our GitLab Localization team. Please follow the grid below to see who the Sales Dev DRI for each language is and the level of support that the localization team can provide. The localization team can provide translations for languages outside of their normal range if given a two weeks heads up. The requestor should know that in these cases, the translation quality may not be as accurate as for the localization team‚Äôs regularly supported languages. When you are ready to request translations from the localization team please create an issue in the\nLocalization Issue Tracker GitLab Project\n.\nLanguage\nSales Dev DRI\nLocalization Team Support?\nLocalization DRI\nPreferences\nAMER Spanish\nKenia Rodriguez\nYes but only International ESP\nVendor Support\nAMER Portuguese\nLeo Viera\nYes Brazilian PT\nVendor Support\nEMEA Spanish\nCamilo Hernandez Murillo\nYes but only International ESP\nVendor Support\nEMEA Portuguese\nTati Fernandez\nNo\nDutch\nMarije Konink\nNo\nFrench\nErwan R√©gnaud\nYes\nMaud Leuenberger\nNo emojis, Hello Last Name instead of First Name\nGerman\nRiko Pfennig\nYes\nHendrik Breuer\nVery Formal, No Emojis\nIndonesian (Bahasa)\nAletha Alfarania\nNo\nItalian\nFrancesca Gianfiglio\nYes\nVendor Support\nJapanese\nEri Nitani\nYes\nMegumi Uchikawa\nKorean\nKayla Ko\nNo\nMandarin (Taiwan)\nAletha Alfarania\nNo\nHow to Change your Email Signature\nYou must change your email signature\nin Terminus\nin order for your signature to save. If you only change your signature in Groove or Gmail your signature will revert back within 24 hours.\nSteps to change your signature\nLog into Terminus\nusing your GitLab Google Account\nAfter logging in click on the Terminus logo in the top left corner\nNext click the menu item for ‚ÄúEmail Experiences‚Äù\nFrom there you can edit your signature and see a preview of it on the right side of your screen.\nHow to follow our FO Outbound Process\nBDR outbound lead generation is done by prospecting to companies and individuals who could be a great fit for our product. Prospecting is the process of finding and developing new business through searching for potential customers with the end goal of moving these people through the sales funnel until they eventually convert into customers.\nBDRs will work closely with their dedicated SAE or AE to choose which accounts move into ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù. Together they will build a strategy for those companies. It is crucial that outreach is very intentional and strategic. When reaching out, we want BDRs to offer value and become a trusted advisor, ensuring a positive impression is left whether there is current demand or not.\nThe FO Outbound process is split in four phases, which should be followed on a weekly basis to ensure a steady outbound pipeline in alignment with our internal KPIs. To manage this process we use a set of datapoints on SFDC on the account-level that are marked under the section ‚ÄúBDR Comments‚Äù. Please reference the guide below on an explanation on how they work.\nBDR Field\nUsage\nBDR Prospecting Status\nDenotes whether an account is currently actively being worked, marked queued for future review, is restricted from being worked, or has been worked in the past.\nActively Working Start Date\nGets populated automatically when an account is moved to Actively Working (AW) Status and the rest of the field is populated, marking it a valid AW account.\nBDR Account Research\nA space for the BDR to document their research and rationale for prospecting this account. A template is provided in step 5 of the guide below.\nBDR Next Steps\nA space for the BDR to use as working notes for the current status of prospecting the account.\nBDR Account Strategy\nA categorization system that we use to high-level denote what motion or play was used in trying to engage with an account.\nBDR Recycle Date\nAutomatically populated two months out from the AW date. Can be manually changed if the BDR chooses to continue working an account.\nWorked in FY Reason\nAutomatically populats when an accounts get moved to Worked in FY prospecting status. If an account needs to be added to this status before it‚Äôs appopriate date, this field needs to be manually populated with one of the choices provided.\n6QA Acceptance Status and 6QA Dispute Reason.\nWhen an account has been automatically moved to Actively Working and Showing Intent, as per the 6QA project outlined\nhere\n, you will need to review the account and change this field to Accepted or Disputed within 48 hours. In case of choosing to Dispute the account you will need to choose a Dispute reason. Use\nAccount in open opportunity\nif there is an SDR with an active open opportunity. These accounts will be flagged on the 1:1 Dashboard for you to review with your manager and other collaborators.\nPlanning Phase (4-5 hours/week)\n1A. Create a set of achievable objectives\nThese goals should be based on what you know you can achieve when focusing on First Order accounts. It is particularly important to know your equation so you can map your activities to specific outcomes and goals in a predictable way.\nThe main objective you should be focusing at is to measure and plan what activity is required to achieve or increase the amount of First Order meetings.\n1B. Map your objectives to your data\nResearch your territory to identify the true First Order (FO) accounts, ensuring no other subsidiaries have licenses, verifying there hasn‚Äôt been a lost renewal in the past 180 days, and confirming there are no open opportunities. The goal here is to vet your TAM (Total Addresable Market) so that you can start matching cohorts of accounts with the objectives that you‚Äôve outlined in the previous step. Indicatively, you can export these accounts to a Google Sheet, or other SSoT of your preference, for tracking since these accounts will be marked as Actively Working at a future step further down the process.\nUtilizing these accounts, create an outreach strategy and plan for the upcoming month and quarter. This strategy should include considerations such as the number of accounts to include in Flows per week and per month, the quantity of prospects from these accounts to add into Flows weekly, whether you intend to target specific personas, if you plan to employ targeted messaging, whether Flows will be used for high-priority targets, and the messaging approach you will implement. As previously mentioned, knowing your equation is important for your planning here. Please refer to the sheet linked above to determine your exact metrics.\nAccount Research Phase (4-5 hours/week)\nDuring your research phase for accounts to include in your Flows, thoroughly investigate and document pertinent information, which may include the below.\nYou can use the Claude prompt here to help you automate part of this process.\nIdentifying new strategic hires - ZoomInfo Scoops, Company Website or LinkedIn\nDiscovering recent job openings in DevOps - Company Website or LinkedIn\nMonitoring for security breaches or threats - Tech News Websites\nScanning for relevant news articles - Tech News Websites\nGathering intelligence on competitors - ZoomInfo or Cognism Insights\nExamining future plans, such as digital transformation initiatives - ZoomInfo Scoops, Company Website or LinkedIn\nNoting recent company acquisitions - ZoomInfo\nInvestigating LinkedIn connections - LinkedIn\nIdentifying instances of GitLab usage by employees or as a past customer - SFDC or 6Sense\nExploring 2nd and 3rd-degree connections - LinkedIn or 6sense Persona Heatmap\nSeeking mentions of DevOps - ZoomInfo Scoops or 6Sense Timeline\nReviewing relevant 10K reports or financial disclosures - Company Website\nThis comprehensive research will provide valuable insights for crafting effective outreach strategies further down the funnel. Regarding account research, in addition to our B2B database toolstack, we also use 6Sense to pre-qualify the accounts that should be considered for our pipelines since 6Sense scores accounts based on their market and profile fit.\nThere are two ways utilize 6Sense:\nThrough the SFDC iframe integrated dashboard (mandatory for FY24Q3)\nThrough the 6Sense Platform (optional for this Quarter)\n2A. Using 6Sense through the SFDC dashboard\nNavigate to SFDC\nOn the main tab with options (leads, accounts, etc), click on the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign\nSelect 6Sense dashboards, you can also click ‚Äúcustomize my tabs‚Äù to add the 6sense dashboard\nto your homepage permanently\nOn the 6Sense dashboard, click the cog icon on the top right\nOn ‚ÄúSearch by User‚Äù select ‚ÄúBDR Assigned‚Äù and add your name\nOn ‚ÄúOther filters‚Äù select ‚ÄúSalesforce Account fields‚Äù and type ‚ÄúBDR Prospecting Status‚Äù\nOn the ‚ÄúBDR Prospecting Status‚Äù field, select ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù\nThe dashboard will now display the top actively working accounts in your name. Do note that these are only accounts that we currently have on our database, while you can find greenfield accounts by visiting the SaaS platform (instructions in section 2B). Section 3 below explains how you can review and utilize this data.\n2B. Using 6Sense through the SaaS platform\nNavigate to 6Sense through Okta\nOn the left-hand bar, click on the Segments tab\nYou will find all of the relevant resources for BDRs and SDRs on the first 5 folders. These folders can be used as per the table below.\n(In each folder you will find a saved template that can be cloned and edited for your individual territories.)\nFolder\nUsage\n1. AWA‚Äôd Accounts\nThese segments will display the top accounts in your current actively working list according to 6Sense intent data. By manually investigating each of those accounts you will be able to uncover further prospect engagement data, and adjust your strategy in converting this account. This report has the same functionality as the SFDC dashboard outlined in step 2A.\n2. Non-AWA Greenfield Accounts\nThese segments will display the top accounts in your territory that we do not have on our SFDC database. These accounts should be manually investigated and considered for adding to your outbound pipeline. Note that we have approx. 15% of our TAM on our SFDC database, while these reports are an automated way to identify great accounts from the other 85% of the TAM in your territory. Please note that the Sales Dev Ops team is here to work with you to generate these reports, as the particularities of our Sales Territories require some editing with the filters. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to us so we help you work through these.\n3. Non-AWA SFDC Accounts\nThese segments display the accounts that currently hold on our database that display high 6sense intent scores, but are not part of your actively working list.\nAfter choosing the type of report you‚Äôd like to work, please follow the steps below:\nSelect the template in each of the BDR folders that starts with the prefix ‚Äú-[TEMPLATE]‚Äù.\nOn the title, add your name or territory as suggested by the naming convention. Please make sure to delete the Prefix ‚Äú-[TEMPLATE]‚Äù.\nClick on ‚ÄúEdit Segment‚Äù.\nFor folders 1 and 3, you‚Äôll see a prompt on one of the filters to add your name to the ‚ÄúBDR Assigned‚Äù Field.\nFor folder 2, you‚Äôll see a prompt to add your region to the ‚ÄúAddress: Region‚Äù field. Do note that based on your territory there are other datapoints like ‚ÄúAddress: City‚Äù or ‚ÄúAddress: Country‚Äù that can be used.\nAfter having done the edits on steps 4 and 5, press ‚ÄúSave Changes‚Äù. Make sure that you‚Äôve updated the naming convention accordingly and click ‚ÄúSave As New Segment‚Äù.\n3. Manual Research on Accounts\nNo matter how efficiently we‚Äôre trying to use our toolchain, these tools are still prone to error, and manual research is required to best shortlist the prospecting lists that cross-referencing will provide.Manual research will also provide additional context that can be used to hyper-personalize your outreach to your prospects.\nFor each account that you want to investigate, start with SFDC to make sure that there are no duplicate accounts. The report templates in 6Sense should exclude existing customers or accounts actively prospected, but we cannot automatically exclude accounts that have a different naming or domain on salesforce (ie. GitLab and GTLB)\nThe importance of diligent manual research will lead to the below efficiencies:\n‚Üí Better use of time in the long-run by making sure accounts are indeed within your segment and territory, or are not duplicates.\n‚Üí Avoiding unnecessary RoE conflicts by making sure there are no hidden parent accounts that would cause SAO ownership to be re-assigned to other segments in the future.\n1. To double-check the account on Salesforce:\nSearch for the account name on SFDC.\nSearch for the account email domain on SFDC.\nSearch for the account website domain on SFDC.\nSearch for the Account‚Äôs HQ address, along with any regional business unit address.\n2. To hyper-personalize your messaging:\nPlease follow the steps below to understand how to research the data provided on 6Sense, and to cross-reference this data with our internal knowledge base so that you create your account strategy accordingly.\nUnderstand and utilize 6Sense data: Each segment has an accounts tab that displays all the accounts that correspond to this segment. This view can be shortlisted further by using the three analytics tabs as all datapoints in these tabs is clickable.\nPredictive Analytics\nfilters accounts by their propensity to buy. This data can be used to split prospecting efforts between high-priority outbound campaigns and low-priority awareness campaigns\nBehavioural Analytics\nfilters accounts by the intent/value-driver that they mostly focused on. This data can be used to split accounts into specific value-driver focused campaigns.\nProfile Analytics\nfilter accounts by the demographic of each company in terms of location or size. This data can be used to run location-specific campaigns.\nSearch for past opportunities on SFDC\nCheck the qualification Questions section\nCheck the unqualified reasons by the AE team\nCheck past email communication on the activity records\nSearch for the account record on SFDC\nCheck Account Rank notes by the AE team\nCheck the PathFactory, ZoomInfo, Marketo integration tabs\nCheck their product usage information (if applicable)\nCheck their LAM Dev Count\nSearch for relevant leads on SFDC:\nCheck for past communication\nCheck for Last Interesting Moment and how it connects to their title and lead source to determine their compelling events\nCheck for Web Activity on Marketo and PathFactory to gauge past interest\nCross-reference with External sources\nSearch LinkedIn Insights for company growth, financials and recent news\nSearch company webpage for recent news, career openings or specific technologies used\nSearch online sources like newsletter or crunchbase\nCross-reference the above with HighSpot\nCheck for relevant playbooks based on company size\nCheck for relevant messaging based on persona\nCheck for relevant pain-points based on value driver\nExecution Phase (5-10 hours/week)\nExporting Accounts and Leads to SFDC, and adding to your Outbound Pipeline.\nAfter having manually shortlisted the accounts that are applicable to your campaign, the next step is to determine the relevant prospects per account and export them to SFDC. It is important to add accounts to your outbound pipeline so that AEs and other SDRs/BDRs know this is an account that is already being touched, and to avoid confusion or multiple people approaching the same prospects. Before moving an account into ‚ÄúActively Working Status‚Äù, make sure there have been no MQLs or opportunities created from that account within the past 30 days, and there are no leads from that account in Qualifying status with activity in the last 30 days or with a future task date set. If you are not sure, double-check with the related AE, SDR or BDR.\nTo determine which prospects to enroll per account, please follow the steps below:\nIdentify the idea value drivers to be used for the account‚Äôs pain-points through your manual research, as outlined above.\nDetermine which personas would most benefit from the specific value drivers by using our CoM documentation on HighSpot.\nRun queries for the specific titles on ZoomInfo, and export to CRM.\nYou should explore the specific personas you intend to target, such as: VPs, Directors, Developers, Security, Architecture, DevOps, DevSecOps, Procurement Officers, and IT Buyers.\nDetermine the number of prospects you plan to add to Flows, with a minimum of 25 per day. Utilize LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo or Cognism to identify these personas within your target companies.\nIn Step 7, compile the selected prospects and create LinkedIn Sales Navigator lists for each persona. Save these lists for future use.\nTo export to CRM, please follow the guidelines below:\nClick the Export to CRM button on ZoomInfo\nThat‚Äôs it\nNo, really.\nTo fill in the BDR fields, please follow the guidelines below:\nUse the\nformat found on this template\nCopy-Paste the Structure to the BDR Account Research field and populate accordingly.\nPopulate the BDR Next Step Date to be at the end of the account‚Äôs Flows length (typically one month out)\n6. Maintaining a clean pipeline, and using BDR fields for cross-functional collaboration\nTo review your current pipeline, along with any leads with next steps, please refer to your segments dashboards by going to SFDC > Dashboards and searching for Watch and Help.\nTeam specific variants of these dashboard components will also be found on your team‚Äôs dashboard. These dashboards will give you a bird‚Äôs eye view of what actions are required from to maintain a clean pipeline, in terms of: i. Accounts with BDR fields past due ii.\nProspects with Flow steps past due\niii. Prospects that have been moved to Qualifying status but have not had any outreach since.\nHow to Get SAO Credit and Create Opportunities\nQualification criteria is a minimum set of characteristics that a lead must have in order to be passed to sales and become a Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAO), these are split into\nInbound and Outbound Criteria.\nAs an SDR or BDR, you will work to connect with inbound/outbound leads that you get a response from to obtain the applicable information required. This information is tracked on the qualification criteria on the\nLEAD, CONTACT, and OPPORTUNITY\nobjects in Salesforce. In order to obtain an SAO, you will need to have the\nrequired information\nfilled out on the opportunity including documented 2-way communication on the Contacts in the Opportunity. Professional Services opportunities are not credited to sales development, these need to be passed straight to the account AEs for them to qualify.\nThe full walkthrough of how to create a SFDC opportunity is\nlisted here\n.\nPlease note that, in addition to the main requirements listed on this link, the Sales Dev org memebers (both SDRs and BDRs) are expected to fullfill the\nInitial Engagement Channel\nas a mandatory qualification field, before being allowed to create an opportunity.\nThe Initial Engagement Channel field is found in the ‚ÄúLead/Contact Review Admin‚Äù section on leads and will be availible when creating an opp for contacts.\nWhen do I create an Opportunity?\nYou have scheduled time with AE/SAE to speak with the prospect:\nIf you are scheduling time with an AE/SAE to speak to the prospect based on a qualifying conversation you have had with the prospect, an opportunity needs to be created and placed in stage 0. On the opportunity, all ‚Äúrequired qualification‚Äù fields need to be filled in.\nYou have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.\nIf you have a meaningful two-way communication with a prospect, but have not had the required qualification criteria to move to the Sales team, you can create an opportunity under your name so that you better track your warm conversations. These opportunities may also be used for better collaboration with your team, as they can be reviewed and brain-stormed upon during team meetings.\nIf the lead is from a new account confirm their number of employees and HQ location for routing purposes\nWhen you create an opportunity with a new account please confirm the number of employees and headquarters location of the account with the prospect. You can do this through email or in your call notes if you speak to them over the phone. The reason for this is to make sure the newly created contact and account are routed to the correct teams after you convert the lead. Please cross reference the employee count and hq location with one of our data tools (ZI, Cognism, Sales Nav) to make sure what the prospect said was accurate. If the employee count is around 200-300 people be extra dilligent as the new SMB to MM employee cut off is 250 employees. We do not want the Sales teams to have to debate whose opportunity it is.\nWho owns the opportunity at this point?\nYou have scheduled time with AE/SAE to speak with the prospect.\nWhen you have entered the qualification criteria onto the opportunity, and have received calendar confirmation from all parties for the intro call with sales, you will change ownership to the AE/SAE. After you have saved opp owner, you will add yourself to the BDR/SDR field. The opportunity will remain in stage 0.\nYou have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.\nAt this point, the opportunity will be in your ownership but you can not have yourself listed in the Business Development Representative or Sales Development Representative field. There is a validation rule that will not allow the opp owner and the SDR/BDR representative field to be the same member.\nWhen will it be credited as an SAO?\nAfter the AE/SAL meets with the prospect to verify and supplement qualification criteria, they will move the opportunity into Stage 1 Discovery. The AE/SAL is expected to move the opportunity into the correct stage within 48 hours of the meeting reflected in the ‚ÄúNext Step‚Äù date field. The opportunity close date defaults to the last day of the quarter, however it‚Äôs good practice to set the date at least 90 days out from creation date.\nIf an opportunity has incorrect data after it has moved into Stage 1 - Discovery, please Chatter your manager about the required changes, they will then Chatter someone from Sales Dev Operations (Ramona, Panos, Ed) once final changes are agreed upon. No one else from Sales Dev can edit opportunities once they are in Stage 1, so please try and ensure you have all the information on the opportunity before you ask the AE/SAL to accept it.\nIf the opportunity is for a new group of users in a Large account where sales is working on a large ‚Äúcentral‚Äù opportunity, then your opportunity should be merged to that opportunity for you to get credit for the users you have brought to the deal. See under\nStage 8\nin the Sales Go To Market Handbook.\nOpportunity Creation Workflow\nScheduling IQMs\nCreating Opportunities:\nIdentify and Relate Communications\n: Identify relevant two-way communications with the prospect, such as email exchanges, call records, or LI messages. Ensure that these are properly logged in SFDC associated with the\nperson, company, and opportunity records\nas needed. To do this:\nSelect the specific activity records highlighting your involvement and press\nrelated to\n.\nSelect the corresponding Opportunity and press Save.\nSelect specific activity records highlighting your involvement and press\nrelated to\nSelect the corresponding Opportunity and press\nSelect specific activity records highlighting your involvement\nand press\nrelated to\nSelect the corresponding Opportunity and press save.\nVerify Sales Organization RoE\n: On ZoomInfo, or other established sources if needed, verify the parent/child segmentation and the HQ of the company or ultimate user.\nIf discrepancies exist, communicate with the appropriate personnel for resolution.\nOverriding Incorrect Account Assignments**\nNavigate to the\nLead/Contact Review Admin\nsection in Salesforce to input correct information.\nAfter making sure that the information is properly reflected on the\nCompany Address\nfields (ie:\nCompany Address: Street\n), please tick the\nCompany Address Checked\ncheckbox on the lead level. If this step is not completed, then you will receive a message to remind you on Salesforce when you try to convert the lead.\nIf unsuccessful, communicate with the Sales Dev Director for assistance in updating account records.\nSchedule IQM\n: For booking meetings, use\nGroove Meetings\nto expedite the experience for prospects.\nMake sure to give a 24 hour notice to the AEs.\nHaving sent a meeting invitation, ask the prospect to accept while on the phone/meeting with them.\nAE Review\n: Expect AEs to verify that they reviewed the opportunity beforehand.\nIf needed, review the specifics of the call, responsibilities, and send meeting reminders.\nAttending the IQM\n: Please make sure that both AE and SDR show up on time or up to 5 minutes beforehand with Cameras on.\nPlease ensure that the location is quiet and indoors for AE and SDR.\nDebrief\n: Have a goal for the AE and SDR to debrief within 24 hours regarding the opportunity being flipped or being disqualified.\nEnsure that feedback is shared in writing via Slack/email and added to Salesforce by the AE.\nIQM Notes\n: SDR adds IQM notes to the Initiative section in the opportunity Title.\nInclude Attendees, Raw Notes, Questions, Summary, and Next Steps.\nRebooking no-shows\n: The SDR‚Äôs responsibility lies only in rebooking no-shows using a structured Groove Flow.\nConduct outreach for 2 weeks. If IQM cannot be rescheduled, AE will unqualify the opportunity.\nTrial Extensions and Ultimate to Premium Downgrades\nTo submit a trial extension ticket for a prospect you will navigate\nto this internal request form\nand fill it out the form using the\n‚ÄúGitLab L&R internal request for global customers‚Äù\noption and then select extend a gitlab.com trial. Keep in mind it only works for SaaS and not self-managed.\nYou are also able to downgrade a Trial from Ultimate to Premium through the internal request form. You just have to choose ‚ÄúChange existing GitLab.com Trial plan‚Äù\nOpportunity Naming Convention\nNew Business: [Quantity]\n[Name of Company]- [Quantity] [Edition]\nExample: Acme, Inc- 50 Premium\nAdd-On Business (seats only):\n[Name of Company]- Add [Quantity] [Product]\nExample: Acme, Inc- Add 25 Duo\nAdd-On Business (Upgrade from Premium to Ultimate):\n[Name of Company]- Upgrade to Ultimate\nExample: Acme, Inc- Upgrade to Ultimate\nMonthly Audit Process\nIn an effort to increase transparency as well as consistency in terms of credit attribution for opportunities sourced by the Sales Development organization, we will conduct on a monthly basis a full audit of all opportunities giving credit to either a Sales Development or a Business Development Representative. Please do note that SDRs/BDRs that are on their ramping quarter are exempt from being auditors.\nParticipating and completing the audit on time is mandatory.\nGuiding principles:\nAll activities must be logged and documented in Salesforce.\nTimestamps for such activities will be audited and cannot be modified after the fact\nSourcing cases must be clearly documented.\nAll opportunities associated with a Sales Development team member must have meaningful engagement for Web Directs and full qualifications criteria for Direct Deals.\nMandatory SLA:\nAudit and XDR response must be completed by the first day of the following month. Rulings will be completed by the management team by the end of the second day.  Invitations and pairing will be sent to the entire Sales Dev team the first week of the month. It is the responsibility of the team member to find a backfill to do their audit if they are unable to complete the audit within set timelines.\nAll activities must be logged in Salesforce.\nPro-actively flag opportunities with questions or created outside the standard process in the monthly\nAudit Doc.\n. Please note that there‚Äôs a separate audit worksheet specific to the PubSec team that is shared separately for compliance reasons.\nExamples: web directs. AE-created. Partner generated (for now), Opp w/no value, duplicate opp\nAuditor needs to review all notes and time stamps related to the opportunity\nAuditor needs to log an activity #Audited on the activity record of the opportunity as mentioned below, this way we can track completion of monthly audit.\nEnsure that relevant activity & products are attached.\nEnsure that Products match up to Qualification info in Call Connect and/or Meeting\nFor BDRs, ensure account was in AWA status\nensuring that the\nRoE\nwas followed\nFlag in the monthly\nAudit Doc\n, any questions related to the audited opportunities.\nEach month you will be assigned one of your peers to Audit. We will share a report with all the S1 opportunities created that month. SDRs will audit SDRs and BDRs will audit BDRs. We will do our best to pair people from the same segment however it is possible that you end up auditing someone from another segment.\nOnce you‚Äôve audited an opp, you will create a task by logging a call, choose ‚Äúother‚Äù as type, and write ‚Äú#Audited‚Äù in the subject line. If an opp needs more research, write ‚Äú#Audited - Pending Review‚Äù and add this opp into the Audit Review spreadsheet.\nAudit Process Video Walkthrough\nAUDIT REVIEW (what to look for)\nAction\nRationale\nCoaching Opportunity\nOpp creator\nOur standard is to get to credited for creating opportunities that meet the qualification criteria.\nWhen you set up a conversation with an AE, you should create the opportunity. If we see that an opp was created by an AE but has the SQS = Sales Dev Generated, there will need to be evidence of meaningful engagement by the Sales Dev rep prior to the opp being created.\nFor Web Direct opportunities, check timestamp and for two way meaningful engagement prior to the purchase\nWeb Direct opportunities are people that bought directly from the store themselves without necessarily having being influenced by us.\nExplain that our role in this company is to directly influence purchasing decisions through positive and purposeful interactions with prospects. Requesting credit when we have not added specific value to a prospect‚Äôs journey diminishes the credibility of our team.\nCheck to see whether opportunity qualification fields are populated.\nMarketing and Sales are expected to collaborate to move prospects down the funnel based on specific qualifiers. When it comes to Stage-0 opportunities these are the opportunity qualification fields.\nIt‚Äôs common that individuals do not fill these fields in the name of agility. This however does not create accountability in progressing these prospects down the funnel in a predictable manner.\nCheck the date of opportunity creation.\nCreation of the opportunity should occur when you‚Äôre engaged with the prospect and have begun the qualification process. There will sometimes be a child or related opp that needs to  be created based on needs discovered during the IQM with AE. Should that be the case, the created child/related opp should have the IQM activity as a related task on it.\nExplain that creating opps as soon as engagement occurs will lead to better management of a BDRs/SDRs pipeline.\nCheck to see if there is a contact associated to the opp and that there‚Äôs meaningful engagement prior to the opp being created.\nOur standard process requires that we work specific leads and that we convert the main contact person to a contact/opportunity upon qualification.\nExplain that this best practice will help with measuring and moving an opportunity further down the pipeline because of accurately being able to communicate the decision-making team from the prospect‚Äôs side.\nIf activity shows up on the record, and the activity is a connected call with notes, verify that the activity matches in Groove.\nActivities on SFDC can be edited freely and therefore questioned by our audit team.\nExplain that Groove is a SSoT that can be used as irrefutable proof of outreach. Even if other systems fail, Groove is always used as the last back-up.\nIf activity matches, check that activity happened in accordance with our Actively Working Rules Of Engagement (RoE).\nTeam members from both Sales and Marketing are expected to contribute pipeline only within their assigned territory.\nExplain that making sure that being aligned to the RoE will not create any contigencies when measuring pipeline.\nTypical Red Flags\nOpportunity Source: Sales Qualified Source should be SDR generated if not validate that there is a sourcing case documented.\nCreated by: The XDR should create the opportunity, if not, there should be a written explanation\nDid the XDR set and complete a meeting on the same day without previous activity?\nAre there duplicate opportunities?\nIs NetARR missing?\nDirectors, Ops and JB will select random opps each month to audit and ensure audit process is being followed\nBest practices to ensure credit for SAO\nAdd all leads to Flows, if you‚Äôre reaching out to them.\nMake sure your activity is logged that shows how you drove the meaningful engagement that led to the opportunity.\nPopulate all qualification fields\nIf activity was a phone call or a zoom call, log notes at the time of call\nIf a meeting was set, make sure you create a stage 0 opportunity prior to the meeting, populate fields during/afterwards. If person will likely web direct, keep opp in your name and update next steps, ensure that prospect is guided to web-direct using the Flow\nhere\n, as per the conversation\nhere\n.\nIf engagement is in LinkedIn or Whatsapp, take a picture and attach to chatter/opp\nIf activity happened at an event, make sure that immediately following the event, you create a stage 0 opportunity and  send follow up email that recaps the conversation that took place\nReports\nSAO Report for SDRs\nSAO Report BDRs\nOur Complementary Resources\nBest Practices for Outbound BDRs\nCold-Calling and Email Checklist\nOur cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.\nTo be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:\nDifferent Geographical Business Cultures\nPersonality Type as per the DISC model\nIndividual‚Äôs Role and Responsibilities\nBusiness‚Äô Needs and Objectives\nCall Scripts\nYou can find three examples of our cold call scripts in the description of the\nBDR 101 Level Up Course\nThe main documentation may be\nfound here\nand the library of resources\nhere\n.\nUp-Front Contract\nTypically used for scheduled calls and Up-Front Contracts. UFCs can also be used as a defense mechanism when cold calling does not go as planned. For cold-calling, UFCs are used when the prospect can commit to 15‚Äô at the time of the call. If they commit to a 15‚Äô for a later time, UFCs are used to open the call and set the agenda then.\nExplore the main documentation\nhere\n.\nDecision Maker Discovery\nThe questions below are suggestions to be used while doing a discovery call, in order to identify the decision making process, and to meet the outbound accepted SAO as per the guidelines\nhere.\nWho gets involved while evaluating a tool at {{company}}?\nWould you expect anyone to challenge your initiative, and if so can I help by connecting with anyone else on your end?\nIf you as a {{title}} wanted to purchase GitLab, what process internally would you have to follow, and how can we help you navigate it?\nWhat challenges do you expect to face when trying to pitch this change internally? Who has a say in this and what do they care about the most?\nEmail Writing Cheat Sheet\nThe table below shows the Command of the Message Email Writing Checklist.\nIt aims to outline the structure of the emails we write to prospects. Emails should be written in each person‚Äôs language and tone and make sure to include the CoM frameworks as per the outline below. You can find additional resources\nhere.\nSubject Line\nPersonalized\n- Use Prospect‚Äôs name, Company name, or colleague‚Äôs name. - Relate to their situation: Use recent company initiatives, technologies they use, Projects they have planned etc.\nCuriosity and Urgency\n- Provide an image of their future situation: Guide the reader to imagine how their situation could change. - Use compelling events to give a clear image of where they are currently.\nCoM\n- Proof Points: Quote Case Studies or other customers. - How We Do it Better: Make use of our defensible differentiators.\nOpening Line\nAvoid cliches\n- Stand out: Avoid losing email real-estate with cliche phrases like ‚Äújust following up‚Äù or ‚Äúhope all is well‚Äù. - Brand yourself: Demonstrate that you have an understanding of the reader‚Äôs current situation and a clear idea of his required solutions.\nCoM\n- Before Scenarios: Paint a clear image of their current situation and how that is causing them professional or personal pain. - After Scenarios/PBOs: Tie the current situation with a clear image of a future situation that‚Äôs beneficial for the business and the individual.\nMain Body\nAddressing Questions and Information provided\n- No Free Consulting: Answer questions just enough to give a narrative to your email and tie into the CTA. - No Transactional Answers: Don‚Äôt make the reader feel like he‚Äôs interacting with an online form, a robot, or a sleazy salesman that doesn‚Äôt care.\nCoM\n- Discovery Questions: determine which discovery questions tie into their current situation, questions asked or information provided. - Trap-Setting Questions: if competitor technology or objections come up, use trap-setting questions to guide the reader into understanding our differentiators.\nClear Next Step, Agenda and benefit\n- Valuable: phrase your CTA in a way that‚Äôs clearly valuable to the reader and his specific situation. - Defined: outline what will happen in the next step and how long will it take\nCoM\n- Measurable: present metrics or PBOs that will be covered in the next step\nAdditionally, you can use the matrix below as a quick-cheet to determine what datapoints can be used for personalization.\nLocation\nInformation\nLinkedIn\n- Have they recently been promoted? - What are the specific responsibilities stated on their page you are trying to help them with?\nCompany strategy from website\n- What are the company‚Äôs strategic initiatives? (become more agile?, improve internal business systems?, focus on speed to market on delivery? Streamlining expenditure?)\nGoogle search name of contact\n- Do they have any blogs? - Have they featured in any articles? - Have they any personal achievements celebrated? - Do they have any side projects?\nKeyword search company\n- ‚ÄúCOMPANY‚Äù AND (‚ÄúAgile‚Äù OR ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù OR ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù OR ‚Äúbusiness process improvement‚Äù OR ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù OR ‚Äúdigital strategy‚Äù)\nLeadership Focus\n- Find articles of leadership through boolean searches and ask propose how we can help them achieve these goals\nCompany News\n- Celebrate company achievements\nCheck support tickets\n- Are they experiencing issues that upgrading deployment options could help resolve?\nMutual Contacts\n- Do you have mutual contacts on LinkedIn you can talk about?\nUse cases on website\n- Do they have the same customers as us? How do they help them?\nSpeak to a user of the tool to create personalized message to decision maker\n- Speak to someone who uses out tools every day to uncover pain-points (performance degradation at peak times) and take that information to a decision maker\nBDR Territory Movement Rules of Engagement\nWhen a territory moves from one BDR to another but the previous BDR remains with the same team (ex: moves from one MM territory to another) the BDR vacating the territory will have the chance to temporarily retain ownership of accounts with which they have generated ongoing engagement (subject to manager approval). At the time of the holdover, an issue will be created that will be reviewed in 30 days to verify account ownership. This includes:\nThe outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which they can demonstrate two-way engagement that could potentially lead to an IQM and new opportunity. If, after 30 days, no IQM has been set and no stage 0 opportunity exists, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory. If the outgoing BDR is successful in generating a new opportunity, the account will remain with them until the opportunity is either qualified or unqualified.\nThe outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which there is an existing stage 0 opportunity where they are listed as the BDR. After 30 days if the opportunity is not qualified, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory.\nIn instances where an account has been reassigned to the new BDR and the outgoing BDR had two-way engagement more than 30 days ago with the account but was unable to convert them to an SAO, and the account later returns unprompted and with no prior activity from the new BDR assigned to the territory and wants to pursue a conversation with sales, the team (manager) will receive SAO credit from any resulting opportunity.\nAny other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the BDRs‚Äô leader and senior leader.\nAssigning SAO Credit when a Territory Change is Uncovered during Discovery\nThere will be times when an SDR or BDR is working a prospect and, after connecting with the prospect, discovers that the corresponding account actually belongs to a different segment than originally thought. This could be due to newly uncovered information regarding employee count, HQ location, or parent account relationship. SAO credit in these situations will vary based on the circumstances and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Specifically:\nIf the SDR or BDR has done their due diligence to verify account information and still ends up finding an opportunity outside of their territory: as long as the related account isn‚Äôt an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, and the SDR or BDR‚Äôs manager has verified that the accurate information could not have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, then that SDR or BDR and their team will get SAO credit.\nIf the related account is an AWA or there is related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, SAO credit will belong to the BDR assigned to the AWA or the SDR working the lead related to the account.\nIf the related account isn‚Äôt an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, but the SDR or BDR‚Äôs manager determines that the accurate information should have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, SAO credit will be assigned to the team manager assigned to the correct territory.\nAny other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the SDR or BDR‚Äôs leader and senior leader.\nIn situations where an SDR or BDR has received conflicting information and it is unclear what the correct territory is for an account, they should Chatter the AEs assigned to the potential territories and have them figure out who owns it.\nWorking with Resellers\nThe end-user account determines the BDR/SDR alignment: If you are the SDR assigned to the 3rd party lead, please gather the information in point 1 and pass the lead to the correctly assigned BDR (the BDR assigned to the end-user account) who will complete points 2-6\nStep\nDescription\nGather billing and end-user details from the reseller\n- Billing company name/address:\n- Billing company contact/email address:\n- End-user company name/address:\n- End-user contact/email address:\nCreate a new lead record with end-user details\n- Ensure that all notes are copied over to the new LEAD as this is the LEAD that will be converted.\nConverting the new lead\n- Name opp to reflect reseller involvement as shown here: ‚ÄúEnd-user account name via reseller account name‚Äù\n- Convert original reseller lead to a contact associated with the reseller account\n- If an account does not already exist for the reseller, create one when converting the lead to a contact\n- Assign the record to the same account owner\n- Do NOT create a new opportunity with this lead.\nAttach activity to the opportunity\n- On the reseller contact, go to the activity and link each activity related to your opportunity to the opp.\n- Activity History > click edit to the left of the activity > choose ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô from the ‚Äòrelated to‚Äô dropdown > find the new opportunity > save\nUpdate the opportunity\n- Change the business type to new business and stage to pending acceptance.\n- Under contacts, add the reseller contact, role as reseller, and primary contact.\n- Under partners, add the reseller account as VAR/Reseller\nSDR/BDR to AE SAO Handoff Process\nThe purpose of the BDR-AE outbound handoff process is three fold.\nEnsure Outbound prospects get the best experience possible.\nEnsure the BDR team enjoys operational efficiencies and have clearly structured ways to collaborate with the AE team on outbound accounts.\nEnsure the AE team is set up for success is receiving outbound leads in a structured manner and have the appropriate information to utilize in converting them.\nTo make sure that the hand-offs maximize internal efficiencies, it is required that:\nThe BDR team makes sure to book calls, with a minimum notice time of 48 business hours.\nThe BDR team makes sure to properly fulfil Outbound SAO criteria, or work with AE to create a mutual command plan.\nThe AE team makes sure to:\nAccept SAOs within 8 working hours after an IQM call.\nTo leave a chatter note on the opportunity record, tagging BDR and AE manager with feedback on the level of qualification and handoff in case of discrepancies.\nTo be responsible for managing the prospect relationship after all handoff types have taken place. This includes re-scheduling conflicts.\n1. BDR Qualified Meeting\nAre leads that have been qualified by the BDR over a Discovery call.\nCoM principles\nhave been applied to the call and some of the Before/After Scenarios, Positive Business Outcomes, Requirements and Metrics have been identified and agreed upon between the prospect and the BDR.\nThere is a clear need or intent identified from the side of the company, and the prospect has clearly articulated a path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.\nBDR steps after discovery call\nSummarize CoM principles uncovered during the call\nSchedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect\nMeeting Type should be a 45‚Äô Call and the body of invitation should be adjusted to meet the prospect‚Äôs needs.\nSend AE Intro Email\nFor demanding hand-offs, customer-facing agenda may also be copied and attached to intro email.\nLog Required SFDC fields and populate Notes field.\nUnless there‚Äôs a scheduling conflict for the BDR, attend Evaluation Orchestration Call and kick-off the call:\nSummarize the BDR qualifying conversation by mentioning and verifying the before and after scenario of the prospect, as transcribed on the SAO notes.\nAfter prospect acknowledges that their internal situation have not changes in between BDR and AE call, recap the expectations and metrics as transcribed on the SAO notes and handoff to AE to move forward.\n2. Joint IQM\nAre meetings booked with leads that are from pre-agreed upon Actively Working Acounts.\nCalls scheduled for these prospects will be taken as a joint IQM with both BDR and AE attending, and leading the qualification.\nCoM principles will be applied during the call, with the goal of uncovering a clear need and path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.\nBDR steps before discovery call\nSchedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect, and schedule straight to the AEs calendar.\nMeeting Type should be a 15‚Äô Discovery Call.\nCreate SFDC opportunity, and log any pre-determined or relevant information from your past reseearch.\nCommunicate with AE, and create a mutual command plan for the call.\nWhen kicking off the call, summarize the BDR research and reason for reaching out, such compelling events, Persons with LIM, etc\nAfter prospect acknowledges their compelling event and internal situation, discovery call continues with pre agreed upon structure with AE.\nOrganizing a Group Demo\nOrganizing a shared demo makes it more simple for us to offer spontaneously a demonstration of GitLab, which should result in a easier handover of opps, and ease to create opps. As BDRs, we arranged the execution of this demo by creating a zoom webinar, and configuring the whole event so that the administrative side is automated.\nDefine the criteria that qualifies an opportunity as eligible to go to a shared demo.\nSAL/AE is involved only\nThe SAL can invite his/her/their customers or contacts in order to add value to their ongoing discussion, if the AE/SAL finds it relevant. This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer.\nSAL/AE and BDR are involved\nThe BDR schedules a discovery meeting with the SAL (whether it is a prospect or customer) that generates a qualified opportunity. Once the opportunity is created, the SAL/BDR suggests the shared demo instead of the individual demo based on the priority of the opportunity (importance of the account, number of licenses, amount of the opportunity, persona). This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer. There needs to be an opportunity in this case to suggest the demo, for the sake of collaboration between the SAL and the BDR.\nBDR is involved only\nWhen a lead with decision power or significant influence in the org (no individual contributor) expresses a high interest for GitLab (aka: high read/open rates on an email, response received by phone with interest confirmed) AND when the BDR has a tangible reason to think that there is a need in the division/team/company (research, information obtained through other leads in the same org), the BDR can leverage the shared demo for HOT leads to create interest or a sense of urgency, the goal being to have the lead jump on an introductory meeting after the shared demo.\nDefine the criteria for different groups of attendees who can join this demo\nAttendees coming from a BDR conversation\nIn order to attend a demo, this attendee needs to be part of an opportunity in at least stage 1- Discovery.\nAttendees coming from the AE‚Äôs conversations\nThe AE can leverage this shared demo to invite his own contacts.\nStep-by-step guide to plan a demo\n1. Get a Zoom Webinars license\nYou don‚Äôt have a Webinar licence by default, so you need to open an access request issue on GitLab to ask for one.\n2. Go on Zoom SSO > Webinars (on the left under Meetings) > Schedule a webinar\nYou will be able to save the entire configuration of the webinar as a template, in order not to set it up again.\n3. Change the topic, description, date/time, and duration\nChange the topic (this will be the title of your demo, and the name of the event on Google Calendar), the description (describes the content of the demo, the idea is to adapt the focus of the demo depending on your attendees), set the date/time of the demo, and the duration (note that setting a certain duration will not stop the zoom webinar once the time has gone).\n4. Tick the box ‚ÄòRequired‚Äô next to registration\n5. Change the Dial country to match attendees‚Äô language\n6. Configure additional settings such as Q&A, recording, and email settings\n7. Save the configuration as a template for future use\nOutbound Account Ranking Matrix\nThis complementary table can help structure your thinking around what outbound accounts to choose.\nAccount Scoring & Prioritization\nPriority 1 Actively Working Accounts (15%)\n- Strong ICP Qualities\n- Compelling Triggers\n- Strategy is Tailored and Targeted\n- Future based next step dates\n- Specific next step notes\nPriority 2 Actively Working Accounts (35%)\n- ICP qualities\n- No Triggers\n- Strategy is Targeted (persona/industry based)\n- Future based next step dates updated weekly/bi-weekly\n- Next step notes should just include week #\nPriority 3 Actively Working Accounts (50%)\n- ICP qualities\n- No Recent Triggers\n- Strategy is nurture based\n- Future based next step dates updated monthly\n- Next step notes should just include recent release # or event invite\nOther Good Account Scoring Qualifiers:\n- Current CE Usage\n- 250+ employees in IT/TEDD positions\n- Good Fit Industry / Vertical (High Growth, Technology, Financial, Healthcare, Regulated Business)\n- Early Adopters / Innovative IT Shops (Identifiers & Keywords): Kubernetes / Containers, Microservices, Multi-cloud, DevOps, DevSecOps, CICD (and open-source + proprietary tools), SAST / DAST, Digital Transformation\n- Current DevOps Adoption (multiple DevOps roles on staff or hiring for multiple DevOps positions)\nOutbound Prospecting Framework\nPriority Level\nAccount Strategy Includes\nNext Step Date\nNext Step Notes\nGrowth Strategies, Ranking and RoE\nStrategies:\nGrowth within an existing customer account: BDR should strategically partner with SAE/ISR to identify additional business units to bring into the conversation as growth opportunities. Renewal dates should be exploited.\nExpansion into parent/children/subsidiaries of existing customer accounts: These are accounts that fall within the corporate hierarchy within Salesforce. If a child/subsidiary account is identified via ZoomInfo but not in our system, then BDR should follow the following process: Create a LEAD for that account and then convert to CONTACT to create the ACCOUNT when you qualify your first lead.\nFree to paid upgrades: Existing Core/CE users can be targeted to upgrade to a paid version of GitLab\nRanking and prioritization of accounts:\nRank 1: Expand with Purpose (EwP) accounts should be closely/strategically worked with SAEs.

A detailed breakdown of\nthese workflows is described here\n.\nSpecifically:\nAccounts flagged as 6QA from 6Sense, whether they already exist on our system or not, will automatically be marked with the fields:\nBDR Prospecting Status: Actively Working\nBDR Account Strategy: Showing Intent\nThese Accounts will be flagged on 1:1 dashboards for team members to review with an expected SLA of\n48 hours\nWhile these accounts are automatically switched to Actively Working to indicate the high propensity to buy, team members need to still review and accept or dispute a 6QA account.\nFor FY26Q1 we are adding a\nDispute Reason for Low LAM Dev Count\nwhich team members can use when they opt to not pursue a 6QA account because of a small account value potential.\nAny accounts that team members choose to dispute using the instructions below will be flagged to the Action Needed dashboards for Managers to keep track of.\nAccepting or Disputing accounts can be done through a secondary field titled\n6QA Acceptance Status\nwhere the options\nDisputed\n(would need to provide reasoning) or\nAccepted\ncan be found.\nAny accounts that marked as\nAccepted\nby the BDR team will trigger the\nZoomInfo workflow here\nto automatically bring relevant decision-makers for these accounts to the\nB6 view on SFDC\n.\nThis is a complementary automation for the outbound team to automatically source some prospects for you. you are still expected to properly add the account to your pipeline following the steps outlined above.\nImportant Note:\nWhen 6QA accounts are non-FO available and non-Compensation Target Account (non-Pursuit Account), BDR Prospecting Status will update to SDR Hold for 14 days. If an open opportunity is not created within the 14 days, the account will be updated to Actively Working and Showing Intent and the ownership will be updated to BDR.\nQualified\nis the Sales Dev Org‚Äôs tool we use to chat with visitors on the GitLab website. Currently the SDR teams primarily respond to inbound chats and visitors using Qualified. The BDRs also have the ability to initiate chats with known leads from their actively working accounts.\nGong\nRefer to the\nGong\nhandbook page for full details on how Gong is leveraged at GitLab.\nSales Development Org team members are provided with Gong collaborator licenses for visibility to recorded sales conversations.\nSDR and BDR team members are able to leverage the\nGong Meeting\noption when creating meeting invites for prospects and customers. By using this option and adding an Account Executive with Gong recorder access to the meeting invite, Gong will leverage the AE‚Äôs recorder access to record the meeting, assuming all meeting participants consent to record. More details about the Gong consent page can be found in the\nGong internal handbook page\n. Once the recording is processed, the Account Executive that was added to the invite will be listed in Gong as the host and owner of the call with the SDR or BDR as an attendee.\nCrayon Competitive Messaging Resources\nCrayon\nhosts competitive messaging resources that are maintained by GitLab‚Äôs product marketing team.\nThis is where you can find messaging related to GitLab vs some of our competiors such as GitHub, Atlassian, and Azure DevOps\nUserGems\nis a tool that tracks specific cohorts of people that we provide in terms of them changing jobs. This automated tracking provides valuable insights, surfacing warm leads that can drive faster, larger wins. This tool helps mitigate deal risks when key individuals leave accounts, and accelerates deal progress when influential contacts join new organizations.\n1. When a person that we are tracking leaves their current place of employment\nThese people are identified by the lead initial source being\nUserGems Contact Tracking\nUserGems will track that person to their new role and will automatically create a lead with their new details in our system.\nThese leads will be flagged on the\nAction Needed BDR dashboards\nfor you and your manager‚Äôs review, as well as on the\nB2 views\nWe expect that our\nstandard RoE\nwill be followed normally in actioning these leads, similar to MQLs.\nThese leads will be routed to the BDR team if:\nThey are associated to an Actively Worked Account\nAre connected to a Pursuit Account, or an account that has been marked as\n6QA by 6Sense\nThe rest of the leads that do not fit these parameters will be routed round-robin to the SDR team.\nThese leads should also be considered as intent data for prospecting an outbound account.\nTake the time to research accounts for the propensity to purchase and intent signals. Could the tracked contact‚Äôs hire into that account be a compelling event for you to use?\nThis data can be found either on our 1:1 Dashboards on report 6 that‚Äôs dedicated to UserGems, or through this\nlead-level SFDC template that you can clone and use.\nAnalyze the hiring and promotion patterns as business signals.\nA surge in technical hires (e.g., developers, engineers) may indicate growth initiatives, product development, or a focus on scaling infrastructure.\nSales or customer success hires could suggest plans to expand revenue through growth or enhance customer retention strategies.\nSenior Leadership hires may indicate an internal restructuring of a department or a new business initiative.\nUse these hiring signals to identify potential challenges or priorities, such as team collaboration, scaling efficiently, or driving revenue growth. Based on these, target decision-makers who are likely overseeing these initiatives, like directors or VPs.\nWe‚Äôll also notify you via Slack and email about these Job Changes.\n2. When a company that we are tracking gets a new hire or promotion\nThese people are identified by the lead initial source being\nUserGems - New Hires and Promotions\nThese people will be automatically be enrolled to a fully automated AI-driven sequence as per the guidelines below.\nSimilar to above, the same people will be flagged on dashboards and reporting for you to consider as intent signals to add their respective accounts to your pipeline.\nWe expect that our\nstandard RoE\nwill be followed normally.`\nWe are actively working to remove irrelevant prospect titles from being created as part of the\nUserGems - New Hires and Promotions\nlead sources. If you notice any titles that you feel should not have been created because they‚Äôre irrelevant to DevOps decision-making in that company, please feel free to use the #usergems-feedback Slack channel to let us know, and we‚Äôll work with our CSM to review them.\nIn the meantime, you can also mark these leads as Status\nDisqualified\nand Disqualified reason\nNo Authority\n3. When people leave or join accounts where we have open opportunities\nWhile we are actively working to improve our back-end so that this cohort can be visible on our dashboards, like the use-cases above, we are relying on sending notifications only for these people. In the meantime, you can use the report here to gauge what prospects we have on\nthis list\n. We are currently notifying:\nThe Sales team for people that joined or left a stage 3 or beyond opportunity.\nThe Sales and Sales Development teams for people that joined or left a stage 0, 1 or 2 opportunity.\nThese people are not enrolled to a specific flow, since there multiple scenarios on how to best address them, please search Groove for templated messages\nlike this one\nthat you can use.\nGem-E FY26 Auto Enrollment\nFor FY26Q1 we will pilot auto-enrolling UG leads to a dedicated Groove Flow which will make sure of UserGem‚Äôs AI functionalities.\nLeads that have no activity, and match the filters on the\nSMB report here\nor\nMM/ENTG report here\nwill be automatically added to either an\nor\nflow.\nThese flows will automatically include AI generated customisation. Please review the\nslides\nor the\nvideo presentation here\nfor a full walkthrough.\nThese leads will be flagged on the dashboards similar to the explanation above and progress can be tracked from there.\nGem-E Meeting Assistant\nAs part of our Gem-E pilot, we are also trialling UserGems Meeting Assistant. The Assistant integrates with your calendar invitations and automatically pulls the contact information of people that are attending your call, but are not in our database yet.\nThese people will be created as net new contacts and leads in SFDC, using the initial source\nUserGems - Meeting Assistant\n. They can be assigned to the existing account or opportunity that you are working on, so you can continue multi-threading the account that you are working on.\nSales Dev Manager Resources\nSales Dev Operations Team Regional Availability\nThe Global Sales Dev Operations team has the office hours below, so that regional team members can know how to address internally.

As part of onboarding, a\nBecoming a GitLab Manager\nissue will be created for each manager when they join, or are promoted. This issue is intended to connect new managers with the crucial information they need, and ensure they have access to all the resources and training available.\nOutbound BDR Process Manager Onboarding\nThe BDR process that we have defined here in GitLab is meant to provide a repeatable set of steps that an outbound BDR can follow to achieve results. It is very important for an onboarding manager to align themselves as quickly as possible to this process as it is a proven method that will help them manage their team in a efficient and data-driven way.\nThe BDR Process is explained step-by-step in the\nsection here\nFor a newcoming manager, we provide the Manager attention needed boards that will be your main tool in understanding where your team is aligned to our BDR process, and where they need assistance.\nTo help structure your usage of the above, you can follow the steps below during your first month at GitLab while\nthe document here will be your main go-to resource\nAction\nBenefit\nClone the Action Needed Dashboard and edit each report to be exclusive to your team‚Äôs names\nGives you a SSoT that you and your team can easily reference\nReview the dashboard with your team, and discuss how the data on it connect to the\nBDR KPIs\nAllows you to understand your team‚Äôs level of maturity and each team member‚Äôs current level of alignment to existing processes\nTake note of any discrepancies or points of feedback from the team, either transcribe them to 1:1s for individual conversations or to the SDR Issue board for org-wide improvements\nEnables you to filter between discrepancies that are caused because of a team member‚Äôs lack of diligence that should be improved upon by the individual OR for discrepancies that were caused by an org-wide operational shortcoming that should be improved upon on a global scale.\nSet realistic expectations with the team about adherence to org KPIs and set a review mechanism to go over them on a reccuring basis\nHelps maintain a repeatable structure of accountability for your entire team\n1:1 Account and Lead Level Dashboard Coaching guidance\nThe table below can help with structuring how you perceive and action the 1:1 Dashboards we have on SFDC and Tableau, the below connect to the\nKPI page here.\nand the videos\nhere\nand\nhere\nare two quick compelementary resources to walk you through how we use the dashboards.\nAdditionally this\n5‚Äô video\nexplains the purpose of these dashboards, while this\n3‚Äô video\nwalks you through a practical use case of how to use a report in these dashboards.\nDashboard\nComponent\nExpectation/Action\nCoaching Opportunity\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n0. Queued Accounts\nFor accounts in AW (Actively Working):\nThese accounts are to be cleared on a weekly basis by being moved to AWA status or by leaving a clear chatter note as feedback on why the account was not added to a prospecting pipeline. This should include datapoints from intent tools or another other SSoT as supporting evidence.\nCarefully vetting and working accounts that are queued by the Sales team will lead to better collaboration, and mutual accountability. Not only are we expected to timely review these accounts but to keep our counterparts accountable to their account ranking by providing data-driven feedback.\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n1. Review Existing Pipeline\nFor accounts in AW:\nThese accounts are currently in the team member‚Äôs name. The total volume should not be over 125 for Mid-Market BDRs and 75 for Enterprise BDRs. As a priority these should be reviewed weekly and action should be taken accordingly to remove or update these accounts.\nWhen clicking into the report the team member can screen all the datapoints that can help them gauge the status of their accounts at a glance. Activity and Research fields can be combined with intent datapoints to quickly see which accounts should be reviewed further manually.\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n2. Research Accounts to be Recycled\nFor accounts in AW:\nThese reports are nearing their automated recycle date, which by default is two months after their actively started work date. This report acts as a fallback report to the report above. A BDR should have already reviewed these accounts as part of their actively working account screen done in the previous step. This report will act as a second reminder.\nIn theory an outbound account will have received at least 30 days worth of outreach since most flows we use have at least a 30 day cadence. It‚Äôs fine to leave an account in a team member‚Äôs pipeline until it‚Äôs removed automatically in hopes of getting some inbound MQLs assigned to the BDR. Regardless, there‚Äôs a business decision to be made about whether expecting inbound MQLs is a sound strategy, based on the team members quota attainment and overall pipeline at the moment, and whether replacing the about to be expired for another account is a better route.\n1:1 Accounts Dashboard\n3. Re-evaluate newly added flagged accounts\nFor accounts in AW:\nThese accounts were recently added to a team member‚Äôs pipeline but at least one of our intent tools flags it as a weak account in terms of intent data.\nIn the spirit of hyper-targeted results, this account should be empty since all tools we have should agree that this account is good enough to be added to the team member‚Äôs pipeline. If there are any accounts flagged it is wise to review them and ensure that they should indeed remain with the team member‚Äôs pipeline.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n4. Check past opportunities for potential use\nFor accounts not in AW:\nThese are past opportunities that could be reviewed for re-engagement.\nClosed: Lost opportunity re-engagement is one of the best converting sources of pipeline for our team. After having reviewed the pressing reports in the first three steps above, the quickest review to make to gauge some low-hanging fruit is this report.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n5, 6 and 7. Assess high priority individuals\nFor accounts not in AW:\nThese three reports show individuals that connect to actively working accounts in the team member‚Äôs pipeline. These should be reviewed and any relevant next steps or actions should be made on the account-level bdr notes.\nThese three reports show individuals with high intent data, engagement in marketing campaigns or recent with interesting moments. While it‚Äôs not necessary that there has to be action on the specific individuals, their behavior can give significant queues into the current situation within an account.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Review High Intent Accounts.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThese reports split not-AWA accounts in a few different buckets. While there will be significant overlap, having multiple reports help prioritize how a team member can review their account list for new accounts to add to their pipeline. These reports should be reviewed weekly and the majority of AWA accounts should be sourced from one of these.\nThese reports all reference our intent based tools, existing RoE around pursuit accounts and should guide the decision-making of team members. Referencing these as a first step should create a lot of internal efficiencies in researching accounts.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n13. Consider AE-ranked accounts.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThis report visualises accounts as per the ranking that the sales team manually gave them. They should be reviewed after the team member has reviewed intent-based tools.\nThe Sales team does not have access to the same data as us so their manual research can be used a good fallback report to cross-reference against the reports in the previous steps.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n14 and 15. Review individuals from not actively worked accounts\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThese reports show individuals from non-actively worked accounts that either have been part of a marketing campaign, or show strong intent signals.\nThese individuals should be approcah as an indication that the account as a whole should be investigated for outbounding.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n16. Review individuals in flight.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nThis report shows a breakdown of prospects currently on a Groove Flow. Should be reviewed for any further actions to be taken.\nConsider whether adding more individuals to a flow for a particular account might make sense, or whether the individuals from the top prospect accounts should be getting additional outreach outside of the flow steps.\n1:1 Account Dashboard\n17. Consider past Actively Worked Accounts.\nFor accounts not in AWA:\nAs a final check, this report should accounts that were previously outbounded for the territory, do any of them make sense in terms of re-engagement?\nOutbound efforts typically take a long time to convert an account, and reviewing new intent data is a great practice to maintaining a good re-engagememt pipeline.\nTableau Dashboard\nInbound Interest Dashboard\nThis dashboard is an intuitive way for BDRs to manually screen their database. It should be used as a complementary resource to the account-level dashboards above.\nWhile the account-level dashboards are pre-made, and there to guide the thinking of team members in terms of account research, this Tableau dashboard allows a team member more flexibility into sorting through the database. They can use the filters to replicate the permutations of the account level reports in any way that they please.\nTableau Self-Dashboard\nSelf-Managed Instances Dashboard\nThis dashboard allows BDRs to track and manage instances that are self-deployed by prospects or clients.\nIt helps BDRs understand how self-managed instances are performing and identify any potential opportunities to convert them into fully managed accounts or upsell additional services.\nTableau Self-Dashboard\nSelf-Managed Instances Dashboard\nThis dashboard allows BDRs to track and manage instances that are self-deployed by prospects or clients.\nIt helps BDRs understand how self-managed instances are performing and identify any potential opportunities to convert them into fully managed accounts or upsell additional services.\nProspect 360\nProspect 360 Dashboard\nThis dashboard\nconsolidates data from key systems like Salesforce, 6Sense, Qualified, and Marketo, providing BDRs and SDRs with a starting point for account-level prospecting. It can short-listed to identify accounts that\nBy offering a holistic view of account activities, including engagement history and lead/contact interactions, it helps teams identify and prioritize high-potential accounts for conversion.

Team Lead roles are able to transfer leads. Director level roles are able to help when account assignments are incorrect by updating account address and employee size information.\nRoles determine visibility based on the region (AMER, APAC, EMEA). Example: a BDR with EMEA in their role, will be able to see all accounts where the account territory owner has EMEA in their territory role name.\nSales Dev Territories by Team role/member associated with each territory -\nThis allows you to see what members/roles are associated with each territory.

SDRs/BDRs should not be credited on renewal opportunities as they focus on net-new business. If you believe there‚Äôs an exceptional case where SDR/BDR credit is warranted for a renewal, contact Sales Operations to discuss creating a separate opportunity or using the exceptions process.\nIs the Account in ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù Status\nNo:\nIt is worked by the SDR team\nYes:\nCheck for Activity\nDoes the account have activity placed by the BDR in the last 30 days?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the BDR Assigned.\nNo:\nCheck to see if there are leads related to the account that have activity using\nthis report\nWhen you modify this report based on company name and email domain, do you see any activity in the last 30 days?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the BDR Assigned\nNo:\nIt is worked by the SDR Team.\nNext Steps:\nSDR chatters the BDR Assigned and lets them know you didn‚Äôt find activity and will go ahead and Flow the lead. FYI‚Äôs the BDR Manager. BDR Manager will work with the BDR to put the account into the correct BDR Prospecting status. If a BDR is able to relay information that was not picked up in the SDR‚Äôs research, the SDR should end the Flow if the prospect hasn‚Äôt engaged and change lead ownership to BDR so the BDR can reach out. If the SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between SDR and BDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.\nIs the Account in ‚ÄúQueued‚Äù Status?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the SDR team\nIs the Account in ‚ÄúWorked in FY‚Äù Status?\nYes:\nIt is worked by the SDR team\nIs the Account in ‚ÄúRestricted‚Äù Status?\nYes:\nIt should be routed to the BDR assigned. The BDR assigned will chatter the SAE about whether they‚Äôd like them to reach out or whether they would like to own that responsibility. The AE should respond within 48 hours.\nIf they reply back that the BDR can work, the BDR will continue with the prospect as a lead record and take action.\nIf they reply back that they want to be responsible, the BDR will convert the lead so that it becomes a contact.\nAfter determining an MQL is to be worked by the SDR team:\nIs the new MQL related to an existing MQL that is part of the same account?\nNo:\nThe MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin\nYes:\nCheck the status of the existing MQL\nIs the existing MQL in Accepted or Qualifying status?\nNo:\nThe MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin\nYes:\nCheck the activity on the existing MQL\nIs there activity in the last 30 days or a follow up task scheduled for the future?\nYes:\nThe MQL should be worked by the owner of the existing MQL\nNo:\nThe MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin. If you are not sure, double-check with the related SDR.\nIs the lead automatically generated from UseGems as evident from the\nInitial Source\nfield?\nYes:\nIf it‚Äôs an SMB lead it‚Äôs worked by the inbound team, if it‚Äôs a MM/ENTG lead it‚Äôs passed to the BDR associated with the territory regardless of the rest of the RoE. BDR is expected to follow the outbound actively worked account process as per usual.\nIf the related SDR relays information that was not picked up in the new SDR‚Äôs research, the new SDR should end any active Groove Flow if the prospect hasn‚Äôt engaged and change lead ownership to the team member who has been engaged so they can reach out. If the new SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between the new SDR and the related SDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.\nRouting Workflow Chart\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nGeneral Sales Dev Trouble-shooting\nI can‚Äôt see certain Groove collections!:\nYou potentially were added to the incorrect Sales Dev Team in Groove. Please reach out to Sales Dev Operations.\nMy version of Salesforce seems very basic‚Ä¶:\nMake sure you are using the Sales version of Salesforce. To check, please go to the top right corner of your Salesforce window and click the blue button with the drop down window. From there select ‚ÄúSales‚Äù.\nI have not received access to all of my tools and it has been a week.\nNotify your manager and have them comment on your Onboarding Role Entitlements Issue.\nI have uploaded more leads from ZoomInfo than what are showing up in my Salesforce ZoomInfo Lead View.\nThis most likely due to these leads aleady being in our Salesforce. The problem is that they are listed as a contact in Salesforce and will only appear in your ZoomInfo Contacts view rather than your Zoominfo Lead view.\nI do not know what this person did to score as an MQL.\nFirst check the last interesting moment description on Salesforce and then check the Scoring tab of the Marketo Sales Insight widget that is also on the Salesforce lead page. If no points were allocated to behavior and only to demographic type information please Slack the Marketing Ops group so they are aware that this lead did not take any new action.\nI received a personal data subject request by a prospect.\nOur MOPs team has set up a process to address any data subject requests for deletion or access to data. If you receive a request for deletion or access to data, please re-direct inquiries to the\nPersonal Data Subject Request\n.\nWhy are BDRs no longer the Account Owner in SFDC?\nBDRs are no longer listed as the account Owner in SFDC to improve Sales Dev and Sales visibility across all prospects/accounts (excluding PubSec). If you want to filter to see just your accounts, please use the ‚ÄòBDR Assigned‚Äô field.\nA prospect said they were going to buy through our website (known as a Web Direct). How can I tell if they did?\nSDRs get credit for opportunities where the SDR had meaningful two way communication with a prospect 60 days before they bought GitLab through our website. The best way to search for a web direct opportunity is to use\nthis report\n. First, set the date range to the time you think the prospect would have bought. Next, find the opportunity that is tied to your prospect‚Äôs account. Then follow the process to request SAO credit.\nNote: Sometimes someone else from your prospect‚Äôs company actually made the GitLab purchase, leading to the opportunity being related to them instead.\nHow do I request credit for a web direct opportunity?\nOn the opportunity record in Salesforce, compose a new Chatter message that includes the following:\nTag a member of the Operations Team (Ramona Elliott or Ed Bao) or the Director of Global Commercial Sales Development (Brian Tabbert).\nDo not tag Sales Support Yourself\nInclude a link to the record in Salesforce that shows your related two-way activity in the past 60 days. If your related activity is a phone call, you must have entered the details of the phone call into the Qualification Notes field on the lead record at the time of the call in order for it to be considered. Qualification Notes entered after the Web Direct opportunity has been created will not be considered for credit.\nExplain how you influenced their decision to purchase GitLab (helped with evaluation, uncovered a need, provided value, etc)\nThe Operations team and/or Director will review the information and decide whether SAO credit is warranted. If confirmed, they will Chatter Sales Support to add you to the opportunity. If rejected, they will communicate to you the reasoning for their decision.\nRoE Common Questions\nShould BDRs flag duplicate accounts?\nYes. However, they do not have the ability to merge it themselves so should chatter @Sales Support to do it.\nHow do we resolve a dispute over SAO credit?\nSDR and BDR first try to talk through a solution If no agreement: Managers will determine a solution If no agreement between the managers: Escalate to Senior Leadership Double credit nor double compensation will be given\nWho will be handling inquiries from an SDR/BDR standpoint?\nInquiries will go to an open queue. SDR‚Äôs will not work them. We want to give marketing time to progress these to MQLs.\nBDR‚Äôs can work leads in all statuses if they are related to their ‚ÄúActively working‚Äù accounts. Outreach to these leads would be part of their account strategy.\nWhat if a prospect comes back directly to the BDR much delayed, when the account is not marked as ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù anymore, but resulting from personalized messaging?\nYes, if they email, reply via LI, or call the BDR directly, the BDR will need to check that the lead is in queue ownership. If so, they must move the account back to ‚ÄúActively Working‚Äù, so that the lead can be put into their ownership.\nWhy are my leads being reassigned to Inquiry Queue?\nMarketing Operations has a daily scheduled clean at 10:30 PM EST/EDT that update Status = Inquiry to Inquiry Queue. To prevent the reassignment, you‚Äôll want to update the leads from Inquiry to Accepted or add to an Groove Flow.\nWhat should BDRs do when a prospect or contact responds with a complince related question or objects to being contacted?\nImmediately reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help and forward any email from the contact to\ndpo@gitlab.com\n.\nHow do I know if a lead is associated to a Partner Account and is being worked by a Partner?\nPartner leads will not be asigned to BDRs or SDRs as they will be assigned to the Partner Queue.

Performance and adherence to values guarantee an interview, but candidates must demonstrate suitability during the process. Factors such as interview performance, headcount, and language requirements can influence promotion timelines.\nSales Dev Performance Management Process\nThe Sales Development organization believes in getting the job done (consistently delivering results) and doing it right (meeting KPI/SLAs, adhering to\nOur Three Pillars\n, and being good partners both internally and externally). Our performance management process is deeply rooted in this philosophy. As we are building high-performing teams, it is important to understand that while we expect results, we also have expectations surrounding how we get to those results. Therefore, a performance management process will be initiated if a team member is not meeting their performance targets and/or is not adhering to their KPIs/SLAs. The idea behind our framework is to address issues promptly to ensure the long-lasting success of all team members.\nThe sections below will provide more details as to the performance management process on quota attainment as well as\nOur Three Pillars\nand KPIs/SLAs for inbound leads and outbound account management. While regular coaching is expected in weekly 1:1s, informal performance management will be initiated if a ramped team member has two consecutive months below 75-80%* attainment (SAOs, Stage 1 XDR Net ARR or Stage 3 Net ARR).\n*Range due to varied quotas\nSAOs and Stage 1 XDR Net ARR\nOnce the team member is informed, expectations will be:\nMonth 1: 75-80% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 2: 75-90% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nShould the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued.\nAfter the formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.\nStage 3 Net ARR\nAs a business we understand that Stage 3 Net ARR is a metric that can take time to influence. We are viewing Stage 3 Net ARR attainment as an indicator of healthy pipeline generation. Two consecutive months below monthly quota attainment suggests potential issues. Stage 3 Net ARR is a direct consequence of Stage 1 Net ARR. Therefore, performance management will focus on what can be immediately influenced by a team member: Stage 1 Net ARR (not Stage 1 XDR Net ARR stamped amounts, but real opportunity value: Stage 1 Net ARR).\nThe process, however, will\nstay the same: once the team member is informed, expectations will be:\nMonth 1: 80% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 2: 90% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nMonth 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to\nOur Three Pillars\nEffective in FY26, Net ARR generated from a Focus Account New Logo (First Order or New Connected) will be counted twice toward this attainment.\nShould the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued.\nAfter a  formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.\nOur Three Pillars\nTask\nDetails\n1. Uphold Daily Activity Metrics\n- Adhere to the two hour MQL SLA\n- Complete a minimum of 50 omni-channel activities per day (calls should total 200 per week, made during\nGolden Call\nhours and LinkedIn/email messages to be personalised)\n- Maintain an minimum of 2 discovery meetings weekly\n- Work lead records within Salesforce by leveraging relevant Flows tags in Groove.\n- Use Business Intelligence platforms like ZoomInfo or LinkedIn to verify the validity of inbound lead datapoints. Take appropriate actions to clean up and assure accuracy and consistency of SFDC/Groove data.\n- Maintain SFDC data integrity by following the outbound workflow in researching and prospecting accounts.\n- Flow steps to be actioned within the same day of them being due. Move steps to a further date only because of national holidays affecting outreach (i.e., Christmas day).\n- Maintain cross-functional relationships in terms of outbound account planning. Attend each initial qualifying meeting (IQM) with the AE/SAE you work with. Document accurate up-to-date notes in SFDC.\n2. Displaying Business and Sales Acumen\n- Display business acumen and sales skills in personalizing inbound/outbound leads, following our CoM email writing principles.\n- Display business acumen and sales skills in preparing for cold-calls, following our CoM cold-calling principles.\n- Display business acumen and sales skills in preparing for scheduled discovery calls, following our CoM sales training.\n- Outbound accounts to be added in a weekly cadence, according to the expectations set within each regional team, in terms of outbound cycle (monthly, weekly), and volume of accounts.\n3. Maintain Cross-functional Relationships\n- Collaborate with the Sales team in terms of account planning.\n- Collaborate with the Field Marketing team in terms of event outreach.\nInbound Lead Management\nThe below apply for all inbound-related leads for both the SDR and BDR teams. Please note that, other than\nSFDC lead views\n, inbound MQLs will also be flagged to you in a dedicated Slack alert channel. The official tracking of SLA times is done on SFDC, but you will also find an ‚ÄòAcknowledge‚Äô button on the Slack notification that you can press so that it helps with daily check-ins with your Manager.\nMetric\nDescription\nResponse Time for leads\n- Net New MQLs: 2 work hours\n- Inbound Responses: 8 work hours\nLow vs High Touch Groove Flow Usage\n- Over 70% of inbound leads enrolled to High Touch Flows.\nInbound tasks past due per day\n- No more than 10% of tasks pending per day.\n- 90% of tasks to be properly completed, not skipped.\nTwo way conversations\n- 50 per week.\nOutbound Account Management\nIn addition to the above, BDR team members are expected to:\nMetric\nDescription\nVolume of Actively Working Accounts per Quarter\n- Enterprise:\n- 75 AWA‚Äôd accounts per BDR per Quarter, measured per Actively Working Start Date.\n- 65 6QAd accounts per Quarter, per BDR.\n- Mid-Market:\n- 125 AWA‚Äôd accounts per BDR per Quarter, measured per Actively Working Start Date.\n- 25 6QA‚Äôd accounts per Quarter, per BDR.\nResearch Quality\n>80% usage of Intent tools on AWA‚Äôd accounts, with high propensity to purchase indicators showed.\nVolume of Prospects per Account\n5-10 prospects added to Groove Flow per account, whose titles and personas match our ICPs.\n6QA Account Review\nAll automatically 6QA‚Äôd accounts to be reviewed, and either accepted or rejected, within 48 hours.\nPTO and Flexible Working\nSales Development Organization Time Off\nIn accordance with the\nTime Off Policy\n, you need give your manager a heads up early of your intended time off so that they can help arrange cover for your tasks, if necessary.\nWe want to help our team members being able to fully unplug from work during their PTO, while not having to worry about their workload or target attainment. Based on this, we have created this PTO Territory Planning Issue that you can use to strategize your work and be aligned to the GitLab value of being a\nManager of One.\nTo log a PTO Territory Planning request, please go to the Issue list on the SDR GitLab project\nhere\nand choose\nPTO_Coverage_Template\nfrom the Description drop-down list. All of these requests are then managed through the board here. and all next steps and guidelines are on the issue description.\nFlexible working\nAt GitLab we have flexible working hours. This means that you can organize your working day as you like and are not expected to arrive and leave at a set time every day, but we do expect MQL‚Äôs to be followed up within 1 hour (during business hours) so communication with your manager will be necessary if you plan to be out for an extended period of time. Managers will provide direction on the routing of leads during that time.\nWith a prospect-facing role in Sales Development, do keep in mind when you are calling and emailing prospects:\nThe best times to call are early and late in the business day, so these may be best blocked for this activity.\nGroove allows you to schedule emails at set times. For outbound prospecting, the most effective emails are those that come in the early morning and early evening, so you can take advantage of this feature. On the other hand, inbound MQL‚Äôs must be handled regularly throughout your day as they come in.\nLunchtimes are good for outreach as most prospects have meeting blocks for three hours in the morning and then two hours mid-afternoon.\nThe above blocks you can use for account research and planning, customer meetings, or meetings with your sales reps, manager, peers, and teams.\nAlthough you are not expected to start work and end work at the same time every day, please do keep in mind the normal business hours of your prospects, and make sure to schedule your own working hours to ensure you maximize opportunities.\nIn short, working at GitLab means that if you start the day early you can take a long lunch break to hit the gym or go grocery shopping in the middle of the day when it‚Äôs quiet, yet you can still do a full day‚Äôs work around that and don‚Äôt need to be accountable all the time, as long as you are available to call prospects and be available for prospect meetings during normal working hours for your region/territory.\nTanuki Tech\nTanuki Tech (short for Tanuki Instutite of Technology) is the world class sales/technology bootcamp that we are provide for the sales development organization. Use this page to walk through the courses and examinations that you'll be expected to complete as part of your tenure in our organisation.\nLast modified July 9, 2025:\nUpdate 6QA guidance (\n6b903c81\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 26797}

We classify these different level of team member cases by tiers. Example of issues/cases by tier level:\nTier 1\nCoaching support\nPerformance Management\nUnprofessional behavior\nRelocation concerns\nAbsenteeism\nTier 2\nJob abandonment\nManager/team member conflict resolution\nTeam member/team member conflict resolution\nTier 3\nEthic Violations\nHarrassment\nRetaliation\nAny Code of Conduct Violation\nAll Tier 3 cases will be managed together with Legal and the TMR team.\nDiscussing Private Concerns\nTeam members who would like to discuss a private matter should send an email requesting support from our Team Member Relations team to\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n.

Simply copy the form, fill it out with your information and send it to our Team Member Relations Specialist at\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n.\nTeam members and the TMR should both respond to questions or queries via slack or email within 24 hours to continue making progress on the issue and get to a timely resolution.\nFor urgent requests that need immediate attention please ask for urgent assistance by sending a message marked URGENT to\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n. If you do not receive support in a timely manner, below is the escalation path:\nVice President of People Operations, Technology and Analytics\nChief People Officer\nAn urgent request would be something that needs immediate attention like team members safety or a code of conduct violation.\nRaising Communication Concerns\nWe ask all GitLab team members to follow our\nEffective & Responsible Communication Guidelines\n.\nThese guidelines highlight the expectation that everyone assumes positive intent, exercises kindness, and expresses your thoughts responsibly and inclusively.\nIf there is an issue to raise regarding someone‚Äôs communication or conduct, team members should raise their concern with the manager of the individual involved or, if preferred, email Team Member Relations (\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n) directly.\nManagers can email Team Member Relations (\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n) to express concerns with a team member‚Äôs communication if they believe intervention is needed.\nIf a team member is in violation of the effective & responsible communication guidelines, the Team Member Relations team will reach out to the manager and disciplinary action could be taken.\nTeam Member Relations Philosophy\nGitLab believes in preserving the dignity of each team member and expects everyone to treat others with fairness, respect, and transparency.  We encourage mutual responsibility for constructive work relationships and communication, information sharing, problem solving and a safe neutral process through which differences can be resolved.  Direct and honest communication is strongly encouraged between all team members regardless of title or level and per our values we\ndo not pull rank\n. Such communication is likely to enhance understanding, avoid misunderstandings and create rapid solutions to concerns.\nWe have built this philosophy to focus on these 4 pillars in line with our values:\nCollaboration\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging\nResults\nTransparency\nCommitments\nWe are committed to providing a safe environment for all GitLab team members to achieve maximum career development and goal achievement.\nWe are committed to treating each team member as an individual and providing a workplace where communication is transparent and where problems can be discussed and resolved in a mutually respectful environment. To foster this environment we take into account individual team member circumstances and the individual team member while balancing the needs of the business.\nTeam Member Relations Function\nTo support our team members, GitLab has established a\nTeam member relations group\nto assist team members and their leaders with resolving work related issues.  The Team Member Relations team (TMR) respects the privacy of all team members and treats discussions with the fullest degree of confidentiality possible.  We have incorporated our\nValues\nand the\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\ninto our team member relations practices and philosophy.  We believe that by communicating with each other directly and transparently, we can continue to resolve any difficulties that may arise and continue to make GitLab a great place to work.\nFor Team Members\nThe team member relations function provides all GitLab team members an avenue to express workplace concerns and to resolve conflicts in a safe and unbiased forum.\nTeam members can express themselves openly and freely without fear of retaliation.\nProfessional behavior and conduct is expected from all team members.  As a reminder use judgement in your conversations with other team members.  We encourage all team members to\nprovide direct feedback\nto each other. The team member relations group is here to listen to team members concerns in an unbiased, open and professional manner.\nTeam members can discuss\nreasonable accommodations\nor any related questions.\nFor Managers\nTeam member relations provides guidance to managers in their efforts to improve team member performance or to correct unacceptable personal behaviors.  Managers are responsible for setting priorities and motivating their team members.  They are also responsible for ensuring the care of their team members as well as meeting GitLab‚Äôs goals.  These two things can be done simultaneously.  As managers it is considered one of your primary responsibilities to understand GitLab‚Äôs\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n,\nValues\nand\nPeople Group\npolicies and processes.  People managers are responsible for upholding compliance on the their teams and considering the best interest of the business.  If a manager is made aware of a situation that potentially runs afoul of the Code of Conduct, Values and People Group processes or policy they should immediately reach out to the\nteam member relations specialist\n.  If uncertain about a specific policy or procedure, the manager should reach out to a leader, their\naligned PBP\nor the Team member relation specialist for further clarification.  When in doubt, it is always best to ask.\nTeam Member Performance Improvement Management Guiding Principles\nA critical responsibility within the role of a GitLab leader is to spend the time required to truly understand the causes of the performance issue and how to address them properly.  GitLab managers will determine if the performance concerns are skill-based or behavior (will)-based to determine next steps.  Below are the definitions of both skill- and will-based performance concerns.\nSkill-based performance management\nTeam member lacks the technical knowledge or capability to be successful in the role\nTeam member is unable to prioritize work effectively\nTeam member lacks the understanding on how to complete tasks\nTeam member exhibits difficulties working with team members and/or communicating effectively\nSometimes skill-based issues appear as a will-based or behavior concern.  However, after delving into the cause for the behavior, the leader may find a skill-based gap causing the disruptive behavior.  The team member may be embarrassed or concerned about their ineffectiveness or ability to perform their role and may react in a way that is inappropriate.\nThe following are a few recommendations for a manager to address skill-based performance issues:\nProvide the team member with additional training\nProvide the team member with a mentor or buddy\nProvide the team member with clear directions and examples\nIf the team member is still not making progress after the manager has provided additional resources or coaching please review the\nunderperformance page in the handbook\nfor next steps.\nWill-based performance management\nWill-based issues are described as undesirable behavior that impedes the success of the Team Member, the Team, and/or GitLab as a whole.  The leader may hear about the behaviors from others or experience the undesirable behavior directly.   It is important that the manager address the concerns right away.  While ‚Äúwill‚Äù issues can be disruptive, there are different levels of severity which must be considered when determining next steps.  The tiers below are examples and are not exhaustive, and should be used for comparision purposes to determine the impact to GitLab.\nTier 2\n- Misconduct resulting in limited material risk to GitLab\nViolations of the company code of conduct (excluding harassment and discrimination)\nTeam member uses inappropriate language that others may find offensive\nTeam members behavior creates a negative or toxic team environment\nBehavior continues even after coaching from manager\nFor Tier 2 level concerns, the Manager should reach out and discuss with the team member relations specialist immediately.\nTier 1\n- Gross misconduct or a violation with serious implications to GitLab.\nViolates a law/regulation (theft, fraud, drug use, etc.)\nPoses a serious operational, reputational, or financial risk to GitLab\nPoses significant health or safety risks\nHarassment\nSevere and/or pervasive language or conduct that could be perceived as discriminatory or creating a hostile work environment\nSince situations differ, managers should immediately reach out to a team member relations specialist for guidance before taking any action.  If unable to contact the team member relations specialist directly, please follow the\nescalation path listed in the handbook\nPlease review the\nunderperformance\npage in the handbook for further information regarding managing team member performance.\nLast modified February 7, 2025:\nReplace ref links with regular links (\n9fe84978\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 1741}

Learn more about our Anti-harassment policy.\nThis is a Secure Document\nPer the stated\nRoles & Responsibilities\n, changes to this page must be approved or merged by a code owner. All contributions are welcome and encouraged.\nIntroduction\nEveryone at GitLab has a responsibility to prevent and stop harassment. Working remotely means that the majority of our interactions are by video call or written communication, such as email or shared documents. The exceptions to this are team summits, attending conferences together, and local team meetups. No matter the method of communication, it is expected that everyone will contribute to an inclusive and collaborative working environment and respect each other at all times. Team member behavior is not limited to internal interactions with each other.  Our Anti-harassment policy applies to GitLab team members interaction with customers, vendors and community members. Should you become aware of or witness any form of harassment or behavior that violates this policy or our\ncompany values\n, please report the incident directly to the Chief People Officer,\nTeam Member Relations\n, or a\nPeople Business Partner\nimmediately for thorough investigation.\nPerspective\nGitLab is a global organization and our team is distributed all over the world, so we strive to ensure our team is fully aligned with GitLab‚Äôs no tolerance harassment policy despite their location. We want everyone to feel confident and comfortable communicating concerns. GitLab respects, appreciates, understands and supports every aspect of diversity. We aim to continuously foster a globally aware team.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all team members of GitLab, whether contractor or employee, in all locations. There are local labor laws in every country and in the case of the United States, state laws, that must be followed when handling, reporting and investigating incidents of harassment. The People Business Partner team and legal counsel, if required, in each of those countries will be called upon to ensure compliance and the appropriate legal processes and procedures are followed. Specific country requirements for employees (subject to changes in employment law) are listed in the\nCountry & US State-Specific Requirements\nsection and will be updated regularly. All individual contributors, managers, and leaders will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for any act of harassment they commit.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nRole\nResponsibility\nGitLab Team Members\nResponsible for following the requirements in these policies\nPeople Ops\nResponsible for implementing and executing these policies\nLegal & People Ops Management (Code Owners)\nResponsible for approving significant changes and exceptions to these policies\nEthics & Compliance, Legal Ops\nResponsible for administrating related training\nTypes of Harassment\nThe following are considered forms of harassment and will not be tolerated by GitLab:\nSexual Harassment\nSexual harassment is considered unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is sufficiently persistent or offensive enough to interfere with the receiver‚Äôs job performance or create an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.\nSexual harassment encompasses a wide range of conduct. Examples of misconduct include, but may not be limited to, the following actions:\nPhysical assaults or the attempt to commit an assault of a sexual nature. This physical conduct can include touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, brushing against or poking another team member‚Äôs body.\nUnwelcome sexual advances, propositions or other sexual comments, such as sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, jokes, or comments about a person‚Äôs sexuality or sexual experience.\nPreferential treatment or promises of preferential treatment to a team member for submitting to sexual conduct, including soliciting or attempting to solicit any team member to engage in sexual activity for compensation or reward.\nSubjecting, or threats of subjecting a team member to unwelcome sexual attention or conduct or intentionally making performance of the team member‚Äôs role more difficult because of that team member‚Äôs sex.\nCreating displays, communications, or publications that include content of a sexually offensive nature.\nPurposely misgendering people, such as consistently referring to someone as ‚Äòhe‚Äô after repeated requests to use ‚Äòshe‚Äô or vice versa.\nSexual harassment is unlawful and is considered a form of team member misconduct. Sanctions will be enforced against individuals engaging in sexual harassment and against supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue. Any retaliation against an individual who complains of sexual harassment or who testifies or assists in any proceeding under the law is unlawful.\nDiscrimination\nHaving a diverse workforce, made up of team members who bring a wide variety of skills, abilities, experiences and perspectives, is essential to our success. We are committed to the principles of equal opportunity, inclusion, and respect. All employment-related decisions must be based on company needs, job requirements, and individual qualifications. Always take full advantage of what our team members have to offer; listen and be inclusive.\nWe do not tolerate discrimination against anyone, including team members, customers, business partners, or other stakeholders. Any form of discrimination towards an individual is strictly prohibited, including:\nOn the basis of race (includes national origin or ancestry, ethnicity, national origin or ethnic characteristics; interracial marriage or association; traits historically associated with race, including hair texture, protective hairstyles, and any other national origin or ancestry ‚Äúas specified by a complainant in a complaint‚Äù), color, religion (including all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief or lack of religious belief), sex (including pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions; breastfeeding; sex assigned at birth; gender identity or gender expression; affectional or sexual orientation, including heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality; and differences of sex development, variations of sex characteristics, or other intersex characteristics), age, disability, HIV status, marital status, past or present military service, life expectancy, or any other status protected by the laws or regulations in the locations where we operate.\nWe comply with laws regarding employment of immigrants and non-citizens and provide equal employment opportunity to everyone who is legally authorized to work in the applicable country.\nWe provide\nreasonable accommodations\nto individuals with disabilities and remove any artificial barriers to success.\nReport suspected discrimination right away and never retaliate against anyone who raises a good faith belief that unlawful discrimination has occurred.\nIf you believe you have been discriminated against or witnessed discriminatory practices, please contact the Chief People Officer, a\nPeople Business Partner\n, or the\nTeam Member Relations Specialist\nto initiate an investigation into the behavior. GitLab has also engaged Lighthouse Services to provide anonymous reporting methods, as described in the\nHow to Report Violations\nsection.\nBullying / Workplace Violence\nGitLab does not tolerate violent acts or threats of violence. The company will not tolerate fighting, bullying, coercion, or use of abusive or threatening words directed to, about, or against a co-worker, lead, manager, executive, candidate, client/customer, vendor, contributor, or any other person. No individual employed by GitLab should commit or threaten to commit any violent act or discuss committing such offenses, even in a joking manner.\nRetaliation\nRetaliation of any sort for filing a claim of harassment will not be tolerated. If you believe you have been retaliated against, please contact the Chief People Officer,\nTeam Member Relations\nor a\nPeople Business Partner\nto initiate an investigation.\nSpeaking up during a public situation\nIf someone messes up, people are encouraged to speak up publicly and within the moment, in order to let that person and others know that what happened was not inclusive behavior.\nThis makes for a situation from which all parties can learn, and is one which promotes understanding. Additionally it makes it possible for that person to de-escalate the situation by correcting themselves and apologizing.\nThis does not ensure there will be no consequences. However, it will greatly reduce the chance of escalation and has the potential to help a situation become comfortable and inclusive again.\nReporting a Physical Threat\nIf a threat is made against you or someone else that makes you or another team member question their safety due to an issue, merge request, email or other work related matters do not hesitate to initiate the following process:\nContact local law enforcement. Note the proper number to contact in your locality and whether the emergency, or non-emergency number should be called.\nNotify the People Operations Team via a HelpLab request. A private slack channel may then be opened with your People Business Partner, People Operations Team member, Team Member Relations, Manager, and the security team helping with the situation.\nThe following steps may be taken based on the threat:\nInternal threat assessment\nTemporary accommodation (friends, family, hotel, etc.)\nTransportation to alternate location (stay with family/friends for example)\nTime off from work/LOA\nPersonal Security Detail\nThe above can be triggered by the People Operations Team, Manager, Team Member Relations, or People Business Partner based on their knowledge of the threat.  Whenever it is safe to do so, please go through the normal permissions work flow, however if a threat is credible and potentially imminent, immediate action may be taken before the approvals have been put in place.\nThe Sr. Director of Security will advise when it is best to halt any of the above tasks.\nReporting Alleged Harassment\nAny individual who believes they have been the target of harassment of any kind is encouraged to immediately and directly address the harasser, letting them know that their behavior is unwelcome, offensive, and must stop immediately.\nIf they do not wish to address the harasser directly or the behavior doesn‚Äôt cease, they should report the misconduct to the Chief People Officer,\nTeam Member Relations\nor a\nPeople Business Partner\n.\nOnce reported, an impartial investigation will be conducted by a People Business Partner or by an independent third party, depending on the severity and circumstances of the complaint.\nIndividual(s) reporting an incident or pattern of behavior will be asked to provide a written account, including any action(s) causing concern, the dates and times such actions occurred, and the names of anyone involved, including the participants and witnesses. All complaints or concerns of alleged harassment or discrimination will be taken seriously and handled confidentially.\nThe Role of Managers\nIf managers become aware of misconduct, they must deal with any allegations expeditiously, seriously, confidentially, and fairly, whether or not there has been a written or formal complaint made to People Business partner. Informed managers are expected to:\nTake all complaints or concerns of alleged harassment seriously no matter how minor or who is involved.\nEnsure that any form of harassment or misconduct is immediately reported to People Business Partner.\nTake appropriate action to prevent retaliation, or the alleged misconduct from recurring, during and after an investigation.\nManagers who knowingly allow or tolerate any form of harassment or retaliation, including the failure to immediately report such misconduct to People Business Partner, are in violation of this policy and subject to disciplinary action, including termination.\nThe Role of Individual Contributors\nAll employees have the responsibility to help create and maintain a work environment free of bullying and harassment and can help by:\nBeing aware of how their own behavior may affect others, and changing it if necessary.\nTreating their colleagues with dignity and respect.\nTaking a stand if they think inappropriate jokes or comments are being made to others.\nMaking it clear to others where they find their behavior unacceptable.\nIntervening, if possible, to stop harassment or bullying from occurring.\nReporting promptly to their manager or the People Business Partner any incident of bullying or harassment witnessed by them.\nThe Role of People Business Partners\nThe Chief People Officer and People Business Partners are responsible for:\nEnsuring that any individual filing a complaint and any accused individual(s) are made aware of the seriousness of misconduct.\nExplaining GitLab‚Äôs no tolerance harassment policy and investigation procedures to all individuals included in a complaint.\nArranging for an immediate investigation of alleged misconduct and the preparation of a written report summarizing the results of the investigation and making recommendations for remediation to designated company officials.\nNotifying appropriate authorities (police, FBI, country specific bureaus) when criminal activities are alleged.\nExploring informal means of resolving potential harassment if a written (formal) complaint is not made when verbal allegations are shared.\nClassification of disciplinary action\nAll individual team members, managers, and leaders will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for any act of harassment they commit. Although disciplinary action will be specific to each case, it can generally be classified into 4 levels:\nLevel 1\nFirst time occurrences of inappropriate behavior. An act out of character. After formal investigation, coworkers still feel comfortable working with the offender.\nSuspension (Paid/Unpaid based on country)\nFormal apology towards inflicted parties\nLevel 2\nRecurring socially inappropriate behavior.\nSuspension (Paid/Unpaid based on country)\nMandatory course on Inclusivity\nFormal apology towards inflicted parties\nWritten admonition\nPotential transfer to another team\nPotential of termination\nLevel 3\nMajor infraction, including retaliation, or recurring socially inappropriate behavior after a written admonition.\nTermination of employment\nLevel 4\nSerious cases, including any criminal offence.\nTermination of employment\nReported to the Police/Authorities\nTraining & Guidance\nTraining and guidance on understanding, preventing, and dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment will be provided to both managers and individual team members. The courses and the related enrollment logic can be found\nhere\n. This training will be provided on a regular cadence, consistent with local requirements, and/or when new legal requirements are introduced.\nCountry & US State-Specific Requirements\nGitLab BV (The Netherlands)\nComplaint Procedure\nIf attempts to resolve the problem in an informal manner prove insufficient or if these attempts were refused or proved to be ineffective, the victim may follow the procedure below:\nWrite a formal complaint and send it to the Chief People Officer or the People Business Partner. When the Chief People Officer or the People Business Partner receives the complaint, they must immediately handle the written complaint.\nThe Chief People Officer or the People Business Partner shall ensure that the complaint is included in a dated document within a reasonable period of time, and includes the statements of the victim and any witnesses, as well as the outcome of any mediation.\nThe victim and the witnesses receive a copy of their statement.\nA copy of the complaint will immediately be handed over to the responsible person within GitLab.\nAfter submission of the complaint to the responsible person within GitLab, an investigation will be initiated.

In case an employee abuses this complaint procedure, the above sanctions may also apply for the employee.\nGitLab BV (Belgium)\nPsychosocial Intervention\nGitLab has engaged with an external health and safety service called\nMensura\nwho are responsible for handling any complaints of harassment that are received but can not be resolved informally and internally. Team members in Belgium may contact this service if they wish and make a request for an informal or formal psychosocial intervention. A request for a formal intervention should include the following:\na precise description of the constituent facts of violence, or psychological or sexual harassment at work, according to the Employee,\nwhen and where each of the events took place,\nthe identity of the person(s) involved,\nthe request to the Employer to take appropriate measures to put an end to the events.\nThe psychosocial intervention advisor will investigate further and provide a report to the employee and People Business Partner with a recommended course of action.\nGitLab GK (Japan)\nProtection from Power Harassment\n‚ÄúPower harassment‚Äù is defined as any act by a person using his/her authority in the workplace, such as job position or human relationship with a team member, beyond the appropriate scope of business conduct, which causes such team member mental distress or physical pain or degradation of the working environment.\nThe law defines power harassment as ‚Äúremarks or behaviour by people taking advantage of their superior position that go beyond business necessity, thereby harming the workplace environment.  GitLab expressly prohibits any behaviour toward team members that falls within the definition of power harassment.\nDepending on the individual, a person may feel dissatisfaction when given the instructions, advice, or guidance necessary in the ordinary course of business.  In such cases where the actions are conducted within the scope of appropriate business practice, they should not fall under the category of power harassment.  Examples of power harassment include, but may not be limited to:\nassault or injury (physical abuse)\nthreats, defamation, insult or slander (mental abuse)\nisolation, ostracization or neglect (cutting them off from human relationships)\nforcing a team member to perform certain tasks, which are clearly unnecessary for the business or impossible to be performed or interrupting their normal duties (excessive work demands)\nordering a team member to perform menial tasks which are far below the team member‚Äôs ability or experience and do not provide any work at all for the team member relevant to the business (insufficient work demands)\nexcessively inquiring into the private affairs of a team member (invasion of privacy)\nTeam members who feel that they may have been subjected to power harassment may bring their complaints to their People Business Partner, who will engage the appropriate internal consultation services and respond to claims.  GitLab is prohibited from dismissing or treating unfairly any team members who report harassment cases or cooperate in an investigation or consultation process.\nProhibition of Sexual Harassment\nTeam members are prohibited from any activities that cause disadvantage or discomfort to other employees or that are damaging to the work environment by way of speech or behaviour of a sexual nature.  GitLab shall take all necessary measures in managing employment to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace.\nProhibition of Harassment Due to Pregnancy, Childbirth, Child Care Leave, or Family Care Leave\nTeam members are prohibited from any activities that are damaging to the work environment of other employees by way of speech or behaviour related to pregnancy, childbirth, etc., or use of systems or measures related to pregnancy, childbirth, child care, family care, etc.  GitLab shall take necessary measures in managing employment to prevent harassment due to pregnancy, childbirth, child care leave, family care leave, etc. at the workplace.\nProhibition of Any Other Forms of Harassment\nIn addition to the prohibitions listed above, team members are prohibited from any other forms of harassment at the workplace that are damaging to the work environment of other team members such as by way of speech or behaviours related to sexual orientation or gender identification.\nGitLab LTD (The UK)\nComplaint Procedure\nIf the employee does not wish to address the harasser directly, or the behavior does not cease, then the employee (accompanied by a colleague/union representative if they wish) should report the misconduct to their line manager or a member of the People Business Partner. Wherever appropriate the line manager and or the People Business Partner may attempt to resolve the situation on an informal basis.\nIf the informal approach does not resolve matters or the situation is too serious to be dealt with informally, the employee will need to make a formal complaint to the line manager and/or the People Business Partner.\nOnce reported, a formal investigation will be conducted impartially by People Business Partner or by an independent third party, depending on the severity and circumstances of the complaint. Individual(s) reporting an incident or pattern of behavior will be asked to provide a written account of any action(s) causing concern, dates and times such actions occurred, and names of anyone involved, including participants and witnesses. All complaints or concerns of alleged harassment or discrimination will be taken seriously and handled promptly, sensitively and confidentially.\nWherever possible the Company will try to ensure that the employee and the alleged harasser are not required to work together while the complaint is being investigated. This may involve the alleged harasser being suspended or transferred to another work area. In very serious cases, a criminal offence may have been committed and the employee may wish to report the matter to the police/authorities.\nEmployees will be kept informed of the general progress of the investigation and the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding.\nIf, following investigation, the complaint is upheld, appropriate disciplinary proceedings will be brought against the alleged harasser up to and including dismissal for gross misconduct. GitLab will work to prevent recurrence of the behavior.\nIf, following investigation, the complaint is not upheld, then the company will support both the employee and the alleged harasser in rebuilding their working relationship and may consider making arrangements to avoid the employee and the alleged harasser working together.\nWhere the employee is unhappy with the outcome of the formal investigation, they have the right to appeal against the outcome if they can demonstrate why they believe a particular aspect of the investigation has materially affected the outcome. Appeals must be submitted within 10 working days of receiving the outcome of the complaint.\nIf an appeal is submitted, the People Business Partner will arrange a meeting to take place with the appeal chair within a reasonable time period. The appeal chair‚Äôs decision will be final and there is no further right of appeal. The appeal chair will be independent of the investigation.\nGitLab Ireland Ltd\nComplaint Procedure and Contacts\nThe Company is aware of and recognises the effect that bullying, harassment and sexual harassment can have on its team members.\n‚ÄúContact Person‚Äù ‚Äì Team Member Relations:\nteammemberrelations@gitlab.com\n‚ÄúDesignated Person‚Äù - For each formal complaint that is reported through Lighthouse, a Designated Person will be appointed by the Company to deal with the specific issue.\nInformal Procedure\nThe Company is of the view that an informal approach to solving matters can often be effective. In the first instance, an attempt should be made to address an allegation of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment on an informal basis through the procedure set out below.\nIf you believe you are being bullied, harassed or sexually harassed you should explain clearly to the alleged perpetrator(s) that you find the behaviour in question to be unacceptable. If you would find it difficult to approach the alleged perpetrator(s) directly, then you may seek the advice or assistance of Team Member Relations. You may then request the assistance of Team Member Relations in raising the issue with the alleged perpetrator(s). Any approach made by Team Member Relations on your behalf to the alleged perpetrator(s) will be on a confidential, non-confrontational basis and will seek to resolve the issue in an informal low-key manner.\nIf you decide that it would not be appropriate for the Company to deal with your complaint under the informal procedure, or having done so you are not satisfied with the outcome, you should proceed to the Formal Procedure.\nFormal procedure\nTo begin with, you should make a formal complaint in writing via Lighthouse, giving concrete examples of the alleged bullying, harassment and/or sexual harassment, the dates of any such incidents and details of witnesses, where possible. You may make your complaint anonymously if you wish.\nThe alleged perpetrator(s) will then be notified in writing that an allegation of bullying, harassment and/or sexual harassment has been made against them. A meeting will be arranged at which the alleged perpetrator(s) will be told that they will be given a fair opportunity to respond to each and every allegation of bullying, harassment and/or sexual harassment and they will be given a copy of your written complaint together with a copy of this policy.\nA copy of this policy will also be provided to the complainant.\nOne or more designated members of the People Group (the Designated Person) will be responsible for carrying out an initial investigation into your complaint. The investigator may agree on terms of reference of the investigation with both you and the alleged perpetrator(s) in advance, and you and the alleged perpetrator(s) will be notified of the likely timescale for completion. This initial meeting will take place as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of your complaint. If the Company considers it appropriate to do so, the Company reserves the right, at its discretion, to appoint or engage an external third party to conduct the investigation.\nWhere the allegations made are of a severe nature, the Company reserves the right to suspend the alleged perpetrator(s) on full pay pending an investigation.\nThe investigator will meet you, the alleged perpetrator(s) and any witnesses or other relevant persons on an individual basis to gather information surrounding the allegation. You and the alleged perpetrator(s) may be accompanied to such meeting by a colleague. The Company reserves the right to refuse your chosen representative attendance at the meeting where appropriate. You will be given the opportunity to change your chosen representative.\nEvery effort will be made to carry out and complete the investigation as quickly as possible and preferably within the agreed timeframe. Once the investigation is complete, the investigator will present a written report to management. Both the complainant and the alleged perpetrator(s) will be informed in writing of the investigator‚Äôs report and both parties will be given the opportunity to comment on the report before any action is decided on by the Company.\nIf, on foot of the report, the Company decides that it is appropriate, a People group representative and applicable manager will meet formally with the alleged perpetrator(s) to determine an appropriate course of action. This may include counselling, monitoring, mediation and/or invoking the disciplinary procedure.\nIf the investigation concludes that based on the evidence, bullying, harassment or sexual harassment may have been perpetrated by an individual who is not a team member of the Company, the Company will decide what appropriate actions should be taken against such individuals including exclusion from Company premises or systems, suspension or termination of service/contract etc.\nIf the Company decides that the complaint is not well founded, a People group representative and applicable manager will formally meet with the complainant, again to determine an appropriate course of action. It may be that some kind of counselling or mediation session(s) is required between the complainant and the alleged perpetrator(s).\nEither party may appeal the findings of an investigation under this procedure by submitting, in writing, within 5 working days of the Company‚Äôs decision in respect of the complaint outlining the reasons for the appeal. The appeal will be heard on the points raised and will not involve reinvestigation of the complaint.\nMediation\nMediation is an alternative method of resolving issues relating to bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. Mediation involves the parties seeking to arrive at a solution through mutual agreement, rather than through an investigation and decision.\nMediation provides a confidential opportunity for the person who feels that they have been bullied, harassed or sexually harassed and the person(s) accused of carrying out this inappropriate behaviour to discuss the matter and to reach an agreement on their continuing working relationship.\nMediation is conducted in private, and is directly between the parties concerned, with the support of a mediator, who will act as an independent facilitator. Either party may withdraw from the process at any time by notifying the mediator, in writing, that they wish to do so.\nIf both parties agree to resolve the issue by mediation, the Company will arrange the mediation process. An appropriate person, acceptable to both parties, from within or outside the Company will be assigned as mediator. The Team Member Relations specialist may serve as the internal mediator, if acceptable to both parties.\nIf the mediation process results in an agreement acceptable to both parties, the mediator will draw up a written record of the terms of the settlement for signature by both parties.\nIf mediation breaks down or fails to achieve its goal, the matter can be processed through the other stages of this procedure. The person involved in the mediation process will not be involved in the investigation process.\nGitLab Inc and GitLab Federal LLC\nIn addition to\nEthicsPoint\nand\nLighthouse\n, please review the\nTeam Member Relations Specialist\nsection. GitLab also offers a\nHarassment Complaint Form\nthat any team member may use to document any instance of any type of workplace harassment.

As a result the\nProduct organization heavily weights internal customers\nwhen considering prioritization. If you are considering building tooling in support of Customer Success priorities outside of GitLab, please follow the\ndogfooding process\n.\nCustomer Success AWS Test Account\nIn an effort to keep AWS spend down, initiatives are being taken to automatically clean up our AWS account. This account is primarily used as a proof of concept for IaC and creating demos for GitLab customers. An automated cleanup script is currently being tested that will tag, shutdown and delete old resources as they are no longer needed. The automation will:\nTurn off and Tag Un-named resources. When resources are created a ‚ÄúName‚Äù tag should be created with a value that‚Äôs meaningful and indicates who deployed the resource. Example: {initials}-GitLabRunner\nNew Resources will be automatically tagged with a Discovered and Expiration tag\nThe Expiration tag is 14 days after the discovery. The script will only a tag an instance once. If you need additional time, please change the date to a reasonable date for cleanup (Add a month or two for prospective customers)\nIf a resource needs to be permanent please set termination protection on the instance. This should also include tagging the instance with an explanation on why it‚Äôs permanent and what its for\nOn expiration the resource will be shut off and left for 7 days\nIn 7 days if the instance is still off a snapshot will be taken and it will be terminated\nIf the instance is still on but the expiration has not been changed it will be terminated\nCustomer Success Tools and Scripts\nBy customer or internal request, we sometimes develop tools to automate certain GitLab tasks using the API. The resulting tools and scripts are publicly available for everyone to use and contribute to in the\nGitLab CS Tools group\n.\nNote:\nThose tools are not supported by GitLab Support.\nCommunities of Practice\nCommunity of Practice\nare cross-functional groups of SME‚Äôs (or aspiring to be!) within the CS organization dedicated to a topic within GitLab or the broader DevOps space.

Trade control laws vary from country to country but usually exist to protect national security and further foreign policy and economic interests.\nUnder United States law, exports, re-exports, and transfers, can take many forms, including oral, written, and visual disclosure, physical shipment, and electronic transfer or transmission. An export can also occur when technology, software, or technical assistance is transmitted to U.S. nationals abroad, or to non-U.S. nationals located within the United States. The export of certain software, technology, or technical assistance to certain countries, certain end users, or for certain end uses, may require authorization from the United States government prior to export, re-export, or transfer.\nHow do trade control laws apply to GitLab Software?\nGitLab Enterprise Edition, related technology, and services (collectively, ‚ÄúGitLab Software‚Äù), are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (‚ÄúEAR‚Äù), administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (‚ÄúBIS‚Äù), and various sanctions programs administered by the U.S Treasury Department‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (‚ÄúOFAC‚Äù). The GitLab Community Edition is freely available to the public and is not subject to the EAR. GitLab continuosly monitors developments to these regulations to maintain compliance and to leverage any opportunity to broaden access to GitLab in a compliant manner that allows everyone to contribute.\nThe GitLab Software has been classified via CCATS G178430 as a 5D992.c mass market encryption product with eligibility for export to most destinations under 15 CFR 740.17(b)(1) of license exception ENC.

Without a COO or central operating department reporting into the CEO, the CEO gets leverage through an\nOffice of the CEO\n(OCEO for short) led by the Chief of Staff (CoS) to the CEO. While the Chief of Staff to the CEO is not a part of GitLab‚Äôs executive team, this senior person reports directly to the CEO and manages a team that supports the CEO and/or cross-functional projects of importance to GitLab.\nTeam Mission\nHelp the CEO be more effective and lead select cross-functional initiatives of importance to GitLab.\nTeam Composition\nThe\nOffice to the CEO\nconsists of:\nThe\nChief of Staff to the CEO\n: the person responsible for running this group and supporting the success of the CEO.\nStrategy and Operations team members\n: internal consultants and doers who support priority cross-functional projects within GitLab. Roles vary based on business needs, but these folks can be specialists (for example, focused on China or technology) or generalists.\nWhen there are gaps, the Office may expand to include additional roles and responsibilities. For example, at times this Office has included our\nTeamOps\ninitiative,\ninternal communications\n, and\nhandbook maintenance\n. As GitLab is a functionally organized company, the goal in most cases is to own an area until another function is prepared to own and support it.\nThe size of the team and which positions are present have varied over time depending on CEO priorities and required resources. For a list of current OCEO team members, please refer to the\ncompany team page\n.\nKinds of projects Strategy and Operations team members work on\nGiven the cross-functional nature of the company goals and given these projects are important to the CEO, the Strategy and Operators team members are often involved in these initiatives.\nProject Criteria\nThe Chief of Staff to the CEO and their team may work on projects that fit\nany combination\nof the following:\nprojects which build or improve organizational design, infrastructure, and operations\ncross-functional projects that need ownership until a maintainer or exit criteria is identified\nprojects that are so broad that they can‚Äôt live within a function but are too much work for the CEO or Chief of Staff to the CEO\nprojects that are important to the CEO\nThis is not an exhaustive list of the types of work the Office of the CEO might do.\nMany Functional\nGitLab is a\nfunctional organization\n, which means the\npeople are organized by function\n.\nWhen a cross-functional project arises between multiple different Departments, Office of the CEO team members may be included to help with the planning and execution.\nIn many cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will be the\ndirectly responsible individual (DRI)\nfor the project.\nWhether it‚Äôs a product feature proposal, a new initiative roll-out, or questions from the board, the Office of the CEO is the group that can be trusted to get things done, get them done quickly, and get them done right.\nExamples of a cross-functional project:\nHelping shepherd KPI and/or OKR progress\nHelping to launch a foreign entity\nSupporting pricing and packaging change initiatives\nEfforts to increase customer use case adoption\nProviding guidance around how to use GitLab‚Äôs\ninternal handbook\nUnder-resourced\nProjects come up that are both important and under-resourced.\nThe Strategy and Operations team members within the Office of the CEO should be known for its ability to become 80% effective on any subject quickly.\nThey are generalists at their core and, while they bring special skills to the table, they are meant to be able to address important problems as they come up.\nA member of the Office of the CEO might help source candidates for a strategic hire, fix grammatical errors in the handbook, and build a financial model all in the same day based on what is important or top of mind for the CEO at a given point.\nThe team helps with work that other teams may not have the bandwidth to do but is important to the organization and/or the CEO.\nExamples of an under-resourced project:\nCreating materials for a keynote the CEO will deliver in a rushed timeline\nSupporting planning for a global conference\nSupporting launch of a new SKU\nNo clear leader\nThere may be projects with no clear leader for a myriad of reasons, including that we‚Äôre still hiring the point person or the lead is on leave.\nBecause of the team‚Äôs ability to come up to speed quickly, they may be tasked with something totally out of their domain with the expectation that they bring their leadership experience to the table, will do the work to make good decisions, and will lean on team members who are subject-matter experts.\nFor example, there has historically been no DRI for the\nhandbook or related content sites\n. As it became clear that this was a GitLab priority, but no function planned to prioritize this within the coming year, the Office of the CEO stepped in to take on handbook ownership until an owner could be identified.\nExamples of projects with no clear leader:\nManaging our ongoing relationship with\nJiHu\nin China\nStepping in to fill a senior level role in another function in a temporary capacity\nBroad\nSome projects or initiatives are very broad and cross-functional and\nmake sense\nto belong to the CEO but would be inefficient uses of the CEO‚Äôs time if fully owned by the CEO.\nThe Office of the CEO is the shepherd for these sorts of projects and collaborates with all team members at GitLab to achieve success on such initiatives.\nExamples of broad projects:\nE-group offsite prep\nBoard meeting prep\nOKR shepherding\nPlanning activities on behalf of the CEO\nImportant to the CEO\nThe CEO will have other projects that come up that they will task the Office of the CEO with, such as following up on something or carrying on a conversation on their behalf.\nExamples of tasks or initiatives that are important to the CEO:\nHandbook MRs\nValues updates\nPreparing for calls\nSpecial projects. These have included:\nOperationalizing charitable donations\nSupporting updates to GitLab‚Äôs expense policy\nQuantifying the value of transparency\nAuditing training resources and creating an accessible source of truth\nCalculating GitLab‚Äôs carbon emissions and leading a first iteration of a carbon reduction initiative\nIdentifying the underlying reasons for why we didn‚Äôt meet targets for a core GTM KPI and identifying optimizations\nSupporting an initiative to increase customer CI adoption\nServing as the DRI for the\nSaaS free user initiative\nHow to Work\nMany of the tasks are quick asks: handbook MRs, formatting changes, or questions to be answered.\nSmall asks should be handled as quickly as possible.\nOther asks, such as OKR-related planning or an initiative that requires alignment with multiple stakeholders, require forethought and more appropriate timing.\nSome amount of time each week needs to be spent moving these sorts of tasks forward.\nAs a rule, everything in the doc is a TODO for the Office of the CEO.\nWhen tasks are DONE, they should be labeled as such.\nThe CEO will review and delete the item once it‚Äôs been assessed as completed.\nPrioritization\nSince the team has limited capacity to lean into everything that it may want or be asked to, it is thoughtful about team and individual capacity. Members of the Office of the CEO will be expected to manage both directed and leadership (largely self-directed) work. You can find definitions and examples of directed and leadership work on the\nCoS to the CEO handbook page\n.\nWhen newly initiated, self-directed, leadership work entails a significant time commitment (>20% capacity for more than a week), the work being done should be flagged to the CEO in a 1:1 or team meeting. This work should stay on the 1:1 agenda between the CoS to the CEO and the team member for the duration of the activity. If needed, activities may be reprioritized based on top demands and priorities.\nMore senior roles within the Office of the CEO can expect to have more leadership than directed work, but all roles should have a mix within a fiscal year.\nOffice of the CEO members should monitor the mix of directed and leadership work that they are doing and provide as appropriate in Office of the CEO Meetings, so the CoS to the CEO and CEO are aware of the current balance and can make adjustments, if needed.\nCollaborating on Cross-Functional Initiatives\nWhile there are rare exceptions, members of the Office of the CEO are not forever owners of initiatives. They plug in to help achieve critical milestones or fill gaps. When a member of the Office of the CEO joins an initiative, there should be agreement from key stakeholders around:\nThe level of support required\nThe Office of the CEO members‚Äô scope and responsibilities\nThe exit criteria for the Office of the CEO\nIf required, the long-term plan for ongoing initiative or project support\nOffice of the CEO members can be reassigned based on the needs of the business and priorities of the CEO. In most cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will remain with a project until the exit criteria for the Office of the CEO is achieved. If a project extends beyond its anticipated timeframe or priorities change, a member may have to leave a project before the agreed upon exit criteria is achieved.\nWhen a member of the Office of the CEO exits an ongoing initiative they will:\nProvide as much notice as possible that the Office of the CEO will no longer support the initiative\nDocument their key responsibilities\nSupport a project DRI in identifying new owners\nWhen possible, stay engaged in the initiative in a limited capacity during an agreed upon transition period\nThere may be instances in which the Office of the CEO leaving leads to a project scope being reduced or deprioritized. In these instances, the Office of the CEO member will be responsible for engaging key stakeholders around the keep/expand scope or go/no-go decision. It will be clearly documented and key folks will be involved in the decision and aware of the outcome.\nE-Group Offsite\nThe executives get together every quarter for the\ne-group offsite\n.\nThe CoS to the CEO plays an important\nrole\n.\nIt‚Äôs\n3 to 4 days long\nwith a\nFunctional Leaders Meeting\nwithin the following days.\nThere are\nrecurring discussion topics\nas well as a\ndiscussion on content\nchosen by the CEO.\nIn addition, the CoS to the CEO is responsible for preparing the CEO for offsites by:\nFinalizing the agenda to include CEO input\nWorking with the CEO on what to cover in offsite introductions and closings\nHelping the CEO to prepare for sessions that the CEO will facilitate\nManaging the Functional Leaders\nFunctional Leaders is a group comprised of all\nCEO-Skips\n, select People Business Partners, and a few other folks as nominated by members of E-Group.\nThe CoS to the CEO enables and manages this group.\nProgram managing JiHu\nA member of the Office of the CEO is the DRI within GitLab for the success of GitLab‚Äôs partnership with\nJiHu\n. Coordination with JiHu requires engagement from multiple functions within GitLab. The Office of the CEO ensures that the appropriate folks are engaged at the right times and that GitLab provides appropriate support to this separate entity.\nFor example, this member ensures that there is an aligned process among relevant GitLab functions after a customer requests to\ntransit to JiHu\n:\nAfter the Customer‚Äôs request of novation from GitLab to JiHu is approved, the member of the Office of the CEO opens a new issue as soon as the contract is issued, and assigns the issue to GitLab Accounting department.\nThis issue triggers the Accounting development to update SFDC, Zuora and NS.\nIf there is no issue raised in the month, it means there is no novation in that month.\nThis process takes effects from 2023-02-01, and replaces the previous process that an issue is created each month regardless whether there is novation in the month or not.\nOrganizational pulse\nDue to its cross-functional scope and access to information, the Office of the CEO is uniquely positioned to see what is happening across the company. Members of the Office of the CEO are encouraged to regularly have\ncoffee chats\nwith folks outside of the team and share key insights and feedback from these conversations.\nMeasuring results\nWe are evaluating different ways to measure our success as a team. These include:\nA company-wide team satisfaction score\nA pulse survey sent to a few targeted folks who have worked closely with the Office of the CEO team members in the past quarter\nScore against team quarterly goals\nScore on success in a few top initiatives within a quarter\nChief of Staff Shadow\nThe Chief of Staff to the CEO may occasionally have a Chief of Staff Shadow, a GitLab team member who will participate in a specific project or initiative for a fixed time. Depending on the project or initiative, the team member may spend most of their time with an Office of the CEO team member instead.\nShadow responsibilities could include: taking notes, providing feedback, and/or supporting the overall initiative success. This role would be in addition to any existing responsibilities at GitLab. Participants would opt in to experience another function within GitLab and contribute to a different part of the business. Since participation would be in addition to an existing workload, managers must sign off before a CoS to the CEO Shadow can participate. Interested team members can share their interest with the Chief of Staff to the CEO in the\n#ceo-chief-of-staff-team\nSlack channel. The CoS to the CEO will follow up with you to understand what you are looking to get out of the experience and review projects that may be a good match. If there is not an existing project, you will be kept in mind for future opportunities.\nOnce a project or initiative to Shadow has been identified and the team member decides to participate, the team member should open a merge request to add their name to the below table. The MR should be shared through Slack in the\n#ceo-chief-of-staff-team\nchannel for review and merge. Optionally, the team member can make use of the\ninternship for learning\nas a framework to guide the Shadow period.\nStart Date\nEnd Date\nFirst & Last Name\nGitLab Handle\nProject/Initiative\n2020-05-23\n2020-08-21\nMike Miranda\n@mmiranda\n2020-08-31\n2021-07-18\nJerome Ng\n@jeromezng\nJiHu\n2021-06-02\n2021-09-01\nSamantha Lee\n@slee24\nShadow Michelle Lee\n2023-03-06\n2023-11-01\nCynthia ‚ÄúArty‚Äù Ng\n@cynthia\nTeamOps\nand\nOKRs\n(internal links)\nImportant things to note\nThis is not a performance evaluation\nPlan to observe and ask questions.\nParticipating in the shadow program is a privilege where you will be exposed to confidential information. This is underpinned by trust in the shadows to honor the confidentiality of topics being discussed and information shared. The continuation of this program is entirely dependent on shadows past, present, and future honoring this trust placed in them.\nGive feedback to and receive feedback from the Chief of Staff to the CEO. Participants in the shadow program are encouraged to deliver\ncandid feedback\n.

Ensure that all audience needs are accounted for at every level in the organization you are delivering the training too.\nDefine Learning Objectives\n- Highlight the learner outcome. Consider developing two to three broad overall statements of what the audience will achieve.\nBreak Down Complex Information\n- Consider breaking down complex information into easy to digest visuals or text. Reference the handbook but do not be afraid to create a visual representation or use storytelling for the audience.\nEngage the Learner\n- Adults learn through practice and involvement. Consider using tools to engage learners in a virtual setting like\nMentimeter\nor\nKahoot\nto stimulate interactivity.\nImplement Blended Learning Course Content\n- Give the learners pre-course work to read and review before the learning session. Use off-the-shelf resources and ensure the content is applicable to what will be covered in the session. Follow up to gauge how they‚Äôve applied what they‚Äôve learned on the job through surveys and questionnaires.\nApplication of Adult Learning Theory\nAdults learn differently in the workplace than in traditional learning environments or how they learned growing up. If you are developing training, consider applying principles related to Adult Learning Theories, those include:\nTransformative learning:\nLearning should change the individual through transformative learning approaches. Start with learning experiences that appeal to your specific audience, and then move to activities that challenge assumptions and points of view.\nSelf-directed learning:\nEmphasize informal learning experiences. Infuse applications of pre-reads and post-course follow up. Have the participants bring up examples of self-directed learning that they have taken that is related to the training course.\nExperiential learning:\nAdults learn through experiences and by doing. When designing a learning experience, apply activities to stimulate learning by doing through role-playing, simulations, virtual labs, case studies, etc.\nAndragogy:\nDesign learning experiences with the assumption that your participants will come to the table with their own set of life experiences and motivations. Adults tend to direct their own learning, learn better by doing, and want to quickly apply their learning to concrete situations.\nDeveloping Learning Objectives\nAdd learning objectives to the beginning of the content to state a clear training outcome. A clear learning objective describes what the learner will do upon completion of a learning/training activity. Good learning objectives are what you want team members to learn or achieve.\nSteps to creating learning objectives:\nIdentify the level of knowledge necessary to achieve the aim of the training. Use\nBloom‚Äôs Taxonomy\nto assist with writing practical learning objectives.\nSelect an\naction verb\n.\nCreate your very own objective\nCheck your objective. Make sure it includes these four pieces: audience, behavior, condition, and degree of mastery\nRepeat these steps for each objective\nSample learning objectives:\nBy the end of the session, team members will be able to describe the steps taken to address underperformance\nTeam members will be able to apply the GROW coaching model framework to coaching sessions with members of their team\nAfter learning about the high-performance team-building model, team members will be able to determine the steps needed to reach high performance.\nLearning Components - Definitions\nTerm\nDefinition\nDuration\nTraining\nThe action of teaching a team member a particular skill or behavior\nVaries\nBite-sized learning\nA short course to learn a skill.

We are open to change and are willing to make structural changes to ensure that we continue to foster DIB among our team and the wider GitLab community.\nWe retain a growth mindset and keep learning:\nWe read articles, attend workshops, and participate in trainings that help educate us about how to foster DIB in our community and how to be inclusive ourselves.\nWe encourage a diverse set of community members to participate in research:\nWe recognize the product inclusivity is important and that we need to build with our community, not just for them.\nWe promote the\nGitLab Diversity Scholarship program\n:\nThis scholarship supports Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging-focused events financially.\nCommunities who inspire us\nWe take inspiration from the great work being done by other communities. Some of the communities who we take inspiration from:\nLinux Foundation\n- A large, engaged community that act as custodians for important open source technology.\nDebian\n- A large, engaged community that act as custodians for important open source technology.\nFedora\n- A large, engaged community that act as custodians for important open source technology.\nDrupal\n- A large, engaged community that act as custodians for important open source technology.\nWikimedia Foundation\n- This community is a champion for free information with a large, engaged community.\nKubernetes\n- This community consists of a large network of user groups and champions that serve to help each other grow and better utilize Kubernetes.\n- This community consists of a large network of user groups and champions that serve to help each other grow and better utilize AWS.\nDev.to\n- This community creates a welcoming place for the tech community, particularly newcomers, to learn and share content.\nHacker News\n- This community is known for its engaging discussion of the latest tech news and trends.\nGoogle Summer of Code\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive and create new opportunities for people new to tech.\nOutreachy\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive and create new opportunities for people new to tech.\nGrace Hopper Community / Systers\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive.\nLesbians Who Tech\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive.\nTechqueria\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive.\nLatinas in Tech\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive.\nWomen in Tech\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive.\nWomen Who Code\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive.\nRails Girls\n- This community inspires us through their work to make the tech community more diverse and inclusive.\nCommunity Learning Pathway\nThe\nCommunity Learning Pathway\nis a course built to educate the community on how the Developer Relations team works, the different community programs and how to contribute the GitLab. Members of the Community and GitLab team members who complete the course will earn a badge.\nCommunity Building Reading Group\nThe Community Building Reading Group is for GitLab team members interested or engaged in building communities at GitLab. Hosted by members of the Developer Relations team, this learning-focused group examines various principles and practices related to imagining, designing, building, nurturing, growing, and supporting communities. Potential topics of study and discussion include:\nLeading and conducting community activities\nWelcoming new contributors\nManaging relationships in and with communities\nNegotiating community authority and power relations\nArchitecting and enforcing community codes of conduct\nCultivating community cultures\nMeasuring community health and success\nConverting community participants into community contributors\nEncouraging community mentorship\nBuilding community-powered innovation and business models\nAssessing community infrastructure and governance models\nUnderstanding community value propositions and exchanges\nBy collaborating as part of this group, members aim to:\nHone their craft.\nWorking with communities requires thoughtful and skillful practice. This group provides a space for collectively reviewing, assessing, and learning from materials that help members become better practitioners.\nCreate space for support and growth.\nWorking with communities requires emotional labor, and people who undertake it often benefit from spaces to discuss the work‚Äôs challenges with like-minded collaborators. This group would function as one such space.\nGenerate and share resources.\nWorking with communities is easier with knowledge of best practices and trusted frameworks. By reading and reviewing materials on the state of the art, members generate a knowledge commons others can access and from which they can learn.\nAny GitLab team member interested in community-building practices is welcome to participate in and contribute to the group. Unlike typical\nGitLab book clubs\n, this reading group:\nis an ongoing effort rather than a discrete and time-delimited event\nis focused on a series of works rather than a single one\nThe reading group operates on a cadence group members determine together. Group members also collectively determine the material‚Äîfor example, a book chapter, a white paper, a research report, a presentation recording, or a case study‚Äîthey‚Äôll cover each week.\nGroup members propose materials for the group to study and discuss by opening an issue in the Developer Relations team‚Äôs\nCommunity Building\nproject\nusing the\nreading-group\ntemplate, then attaching the\nReading Group::Proposed\nlabel to it.\nGroup members can then browse one another‚Äôs suggestions and collectively select what to study.\nWhen they determine what they‚Äôll read, they re-label the issue\nReading Group::Up Next.\nWhen they begin reading and studying proposed material, they re-label the issue, applying the\nReading Group::Now Reading\nlabel.\nAnd when they‚Äôve finished a selection, they apply the\nReading Group::Finished\nlabel to the associated issue. A\nproject board\ntracks all selections.\nAs they read, group members share notes and impressions asynchronously\nvia files\nstored in the\nCommunity Building\nproject. When they have completed a selection, they polish these notes and update the\nCommunity Building\nwiki accordingly.\nIn each cycle, a group member (typically the person who proposed the materials) acts as ‚Äúleader.‚Äù Group leaders pose some basic discussion questions or thought-generating insights to guide the group‚Äôs reading and frame its discussion. Group members meet at regular intervals for live, synchronous discussion of the reading materials (suggested time for discussion meetings: 45 minutes). Recordings of these meetings are available, but because discussions often contain personal details and sensitive issues, these recordings are only access to GitLab team members via an internal Google Drive.\nCommunity Learning Pathway: Course Resources\nCommunity Learning Pathway The Community Learning pathway is a course on the GitLab Learn platform, ‚Ä¶\nCommunity Programs\nMeet the Community Programs team at GitLab\nContributor Success Team\nCore Team\nBecoming a Core Team member A new member can be added to the Core Team at any time through the ‚Ä¶\nDeveloper Advocacy\nDeveloper Advocates build GitLab's technical brand with deep, meaningful conversations on engineering topics relevant to our community.\nDeveloper Relations - Content Effectiveness\nHow the Developer Relations team measures effectiveness of content it creates.\nDeveloper Relations Content Requests\nHow to request content from the Developer Relations team\nDeveloper Relations Department Performance Indicators\nPerformance Indicators for the Developer Relations Department at GitLab\nDeveloper Relations Events\nEvents are a great way for GitLab and the Developer Relations team to connect with customers and the ‚Ä¶\nDeveloper Relations Program Management\nThe Developer Relations team works from issues and issue boards.

We include it in every way possible and in all that we do.\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging at GitLab\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging is fundamental to the success of GitLab.  We include it in every way possible and in all that we do.  We strive for a transparent environment where all globally dispersed voices are heard and welcomed.  We strive for an environment where people can show up as their full selves each day and can contribute to their best ability.  And with over 100,000 organizations utilizing GitLab across the globe, we strive for a team that is representative of our users.\nDiversity complements our other\nvalues\n, specifically Collaboration, Efficiency and Results.\nAnd diversity in our leadership\nsupports innovation\n,\npromotes better decision making\nand\nimproves financial results\n.\nGitLab‚Äôs Diversity Inclusion and Belonging Mission\nMission\n: At GitLab, we believe everyone can contribute and the Diversity Inclusion and Belonging Team are building scalable strategies based on our acronym, A.D.A.P.T. which stands for\nction,\noing Good in the communities we serve, holding ourselves\nccountable and creating equitable\nolicies in a\nransparent environment.  We are focused on helping to build high performing, customer centric teams by expanding, establishing, embedding our DIB  (/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion). Just as DIB is a journey, our acronym,\nmirrors the agility required throughout that journey.\nAction\n- Action puts intentionality into how we attract, progress and retain our team members as well as engage with our customers and the open source community.\nDo Good\n- We ‚ÄúDo Good‚Äù by providing avenues for GitLab & team members to meaningfully contribute to our community and society.\nAccountable\n- We hold ourselves Accountable in the commitments we make as well as being Answerable for the outcome.\nPolicies\n- We build scalable Policies to govern our work and actionable processes which inform our program development and execution.\nTransparent\n- Transparency is the T in our GitLab CREDIT values and how we operate within DIB ensuring that our internal efforts are reflected externally.\nGitLab‚Äôs Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Vision\nVision\n: The Diversity Inclusion and Belonging value empowers everyone to contribute.\nGitLab‚Äôs definition of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging\nThe phrase ‚ÄúDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging‚Äù (or DIB) refers to the terminology for the initiative to create a diverse workforce and an environment where everyone can be their full selves.\nDiversity\nrefers to characteristics of the people who make up GitLab and how they identify. Race, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation are\nsome\nexamples of how the data might be categorized when looking at GitLab‚Äôs diversity.\nSometimes we can see things that make us diverse and sometimes we can‚Äôt. We believe that a company composed of a diverse group of people may lead to diverse opinions and ideas which, if productively engaged with, can build innovation.\nGitLab uses the term ‚Äúunderrepresented‚Äù and it is meant to be a way of recognizing that we need more of what we do not have so that we can be at our best.\nThe context is ‚Äúat GitLab‚Äù or ‚Äúin a specific department or team at GitLab.‚Äù\nThis term is generally used in the context of reporting on how GitLab is working on understanding and improving the sourcing, interviewing, hiring, and retention of those who either want to work or currently work at GitLab.\nA single person\nshould not\nbe referred to as a ‚Äúdiverse person‚Äù or a ‚Äúdiversity hire‚Äù which would imply they are not included in the current community or that they are only employed because of a factor that is not directly related to their skills and their ability to do their job.\nPeople should not be singled out or ‚Äúothered‚Äù by labels with cold terminology in personal interactions.\nFor additional information about how GitLab uses this data to make progress, please see\n‚Äúselect underrepresented group‚Äù\nInclusion\nis the ability to recognize, respect, and value differences in those around us.  It focuses on the action and understanding of what makes us diverse and working towards building a diverse team and creating welcoming workplace. It requires skills such as empathy, openness, listening, etc.  This lays the foundation of an inclusive mindset.  The foundation of understanding gives way to the actions and being intentional about creating policies and practices that embrace diversity that in the end change the overall company culture to create an environment of inclusion. Inclusion also means being aware of both\npositive and negative biases\nand how those biases impact who we hire, work with, and retain.\nGitLab believes that many perspectives coming together creates a more innovative environment to work in with more satisfied team members, leading to a better product and increased profitability.\nBelonging\nis a feeling that your insights and contributions are valued. It goes back to team members feeling they can bring their full selves to work. It‚Äôs not enough to simply include people to have a ‚Äúseat at the table‚Äù, but it‚Äôs important to amplify everyone‚Äôs voices, remove barriers and appreciate each others for their unique backgrounds.\nEmbracing inclusion may increase the\nsense of belonging\n. Team members become more engaged and are invested in the work they are doing, because they are able to see themselves in the work being accomplished with the company overall.\nWe believe in empowering team members to get their work done efficiently and collaboratively by establishing clear\nDRIs\nfor all our work.\nDRIs do not owe anyone an explanation for their decisions\n, but DRIs can still acknowledge input by closing an issue and marking it\nWon't Do\nor commenting on an issue acknowledging that they have read all the comments.\nAll team members don‚Äôt have to agree on the best course of action- we can\ndisagree, commit, and disagree\n- but everyone can contribute and it is on the DRI to acknowledge those.\nSome other ways we actively cultivate a sense of Belonging at GitLab include creating and cultivating allies, welcoming family members in the background of a call, and sharing\nnegative feedback in 1-1 settings\n.\nA good way to look at Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is:\nDiversity\ndiversity dimensions/layers that make people who they are\nknowing the layers and having a seat at the table\nInclusion\nhaving a voice\nfeeling empowered to use your voice\nBelonging\nacknowledgment of your voice being heard\nthe feeling of being a part of something\ncreating an environment where team members feel secure to be themselves\nExamples of Select Underrepresented Groups\nAn underrepresented group describes a subset of a population that holds a smaller percentage within a significant subgroup than the subset holds in the general population. The accepted definition of ‚Äúunderrepresented minorities‚Äù from the National Science Foundation and other major research institutions focuses on racial and ethnic groups whose representation in a profession is significantly below their representation in the general population.  Populations whose representation in tech roles has been historically low.  Tech roles are based on Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 skill designations. At GitLab, this includes all technical roles across the company, such as Engineering & Product.\nAt GitLab, we consider the following groups to be\nunderrepresented groups\n:\nWomen - Globally\nWomen in\nManagement\n- Globally\nWomen in\nSenior Leadership\n- Globally\nBlack/African American - United States\nBlack/African American in\nManagement\n- United States\nBlack/African American in\nSenior Leadership\n- United States\nHispanic/Latino - United States\nHispanic/Latino in\nManagement\n- United States\nHispanic/Latino in\nSenior Leadership\n- United States\nIndigenous Peoples/Alaska Native - United States\nIndigenous Peoples/Alaska Native in\nManagement\n- United States\nIndigenous Peoples/Alaska Native in\nSenior Leadership\n- United States\nHawaiian/Pacific Islander - United States\nHawaiian/Pacific Islander in\nManagement\n- United States\nHawaiian/Pacific Islander in\nSenior Leadership\n- United States\n**Due to data and or legal limitations, this is not an exhaustive list of all of our underrepresented groups. Those with disabilities, those that identify as LGBTQIA+, those who choose not to disclose as well as underrepresented ethnicities outside of the US, etc.\nThe DIB Team is actively working on finding data sets outside the US and inclusion metrics for underrepresented groups we cannot report on as team member representation.\nOf Note: Management refers to Team Members who are People Managers, whereas Leadership denotes Team Members who are in Director-level positions and above.\nSource: GitLab‚Äôs People Analytics Team, WorkDay\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging Team\nSherida McMullan\n- Vice President, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging\nManager, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging\nNaomi Johnson - DIB Business Partner\nValues\nInclusive teams are naturally more engaged, collaborative and innovative.\nWe aim to align\nour values\nto be reflective of our company wide commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment.\nIn addition, the very nature of our company is to facilitate and foster inclusion.\nWe believe in asynchronous communication, we allow flexible work hours. GitLab team members are encouraged to work when and where they are most comfortable.\nFully distributed and completely connected\nThe GitLab team is fully distributed across the globe, providing our team the opportunity to connect with each others cultures, celebrations and unique traditions.\nWe collaborate professionally and connect personally!\nOur unique all-remote team opens our door to everyone.\nCandidates are not limited by geography and we\nchampion this approach\n, to the extent that it‚Äôs possible, for all companies!\nBy having no offices and allowing each GitLab team member to work and live where they are most comfortable, GitLab offers a uniquely inclusive culture.\nAll-remote means that you\nwill not sacrifice career advancement\nby working outside of the office, as even GitLab executives are fully remote.\nAll-remote creates a workplace where caregivers, individuals with physical disabilities, etc. are not disadvantaged for being unable to regularly commute into an office.\nGitLab‚Äôs approach to\nSpending Company Money\nenables all team members to create a work environment uniquely tailored for them.\nAll-remote enables those who must relocate frequently for family and personal reasons to take their career with them.\nAll-remote allows movement and relocation to physical settings that contribute to an individual‚Äôs health (e.g. moving to a location with an improved air quality index).\nLearn more about GitLab‚Äôs\nall-remote culture\n.\nGitLab team member data\nPlease see our\nidentity data\n.\nWhat we are doing with Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging\nTalent Acquisition initiatives\nThis page provides an overview of our Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Talent Acquisition initiatives\n.\nEngineering Initiatives\nThis page provides an overview of our Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Engineering initiatives\nSales Initiatives\n#IamRemarkable Workshop\n#IamRemarkable\nis a workshop created by Google. The initiative aims to individuals to celebrate their achievements in the workplace and beyond, and to challenge perceptions around self-promotion.\nLogistics\nAt GitLab we launched the #IamRemarkable workshop in April 2021, and aim to continue with two workshops per quarter on an ongoing basis. Before the start of each quarter, a quarterly workshop planning issue will be opened where team members have the opportunity to volunteer to participate. Slots will be allocated on first come first serve basis.\nThe workshops are kept to a max of 15 team members to generate more comfort and psychological safety within the group, in addition to providing everyone with an opportunity to share and contribute to discussion. Each workshop is two hours in duration. Due to the personal nature of the workshop, we do not record #IamRemarkable sessions.\nFacilitators\nCurrently, we have three GitLab team members who are certified to facilitate the #IamRemarkable workshop:\nGiuliana Lucchesi\nTerri Chu\nGosia Ksionek\nIn order to more efficiently scale this initiative at GitLab, we would\nlove\nto have more facilitators join us! Anyone can\nregister to become a facilitator\n. As soon as you have been certified, feel free to add your name to the list of facilitators above.\nInclusive benefits\nWe list our\nPregnancy & Maternity Care\npublicly so people don‚Äôt have to ask for them during interviews. In addition GitLab offers an Employee Assistance Program to all team members via\nModern Health\n, a one-stop shop for all tools related to mental well-being and self-improvement.\nInclusive language\nIn our\nwe list: ‚ÄòUse inclusive language. For example, prefer ‚ÄúHi everybody‚Äù or ‚ÄúHi people‚Äù to ‚ÄúHi guys‚Äù.\nTMRGs - Team Member Resource Groups\nWe have created several TMRGs and welcome interest in creating new ones. Would you like to sign up for an Team Member Resource Group, start an TMRG, or just learn more?  See our\nTMRG Guide\n.\nMilitary veterans and spouses\nGitLab welcomes military veterans from around the world, as well as military spouses, to learn more about\nlife at GitLab\nand to apply for\nvacancies\n. We recognize the values gained from military experience, and we foster an\ninclusive atmosphere\nto thrive in when returning to civilian life.\nOur\nall-remote culture\nprovides an ideal work environment for military veterans and spouses. By empowering team members to live and work where they are most comfortable, veterans and spouses can work in a safe, nurturing environment that they\nchoose and design\n.\nWe encourage military veterans and spouses to\nread testimonials\nfrom GitLab team members to understand the benefits of all-remote when\njoining the workforce\nfollowing military service. We are committed to our\nMilitary Leave\npolicy.\nGitLab is actively\niterating\nwithin Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging and Talent Acquisition to ensure that additional underrepresented groups are pursued, embraced, and positioned for success.\nDisability Inclusion\nGitLab welcomes all types of team members, including any that may choose to identify as ones that currently have or were previously diagnosed as having a disability. In our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) Workday, on the Job tab page, in the Equal Employment Opportunity section, we have a field titled\nDisability Status\nthat we ask our team members to complete during the onboarding process.\nThe reason we ask is because it is a legal requirement in the United States under Section 503 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973\n, as we are a Federal contractor and are required to ask employees to\nvoluntarily\nself-identify if they have a disability or have ever had a disability, and to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities.\nThe options of this field are:\nYes, I have or previously had a disability\nNo, I do not have a disability\nPrefer Not to Answer\nIf you are unsure how to answer, please review our\nIndividual with Disabilities Policy\n.\nAt GitLab, we are proud to make reasonable accommodations to the known disability of a team member. Please review the\nreasonable accommodation\nhandbook section if you need a reasonable accommodation due to your disability. Find more information on GitLab Inc‚Äôs\nIndividuals with Disabilities\npolicy.\nUnited States Veteran Inclusion\nThe United States Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) enforces the affirmative action provisions of the Vietnam Era Veterans‚Äô Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. This law, sometimes referred to as VEVRAA, requires employers doing business with the United States Federal Government (such as our GitLab Federal entity) to take steps to recruit, hire and promote protected veterans. It also makes it illegal to discriminate against protected veterans when making employment decisions on hiring, firing, pay, benefits, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, and other employment-related activities. Under VEVRAA, a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military and was discharged or release from service under conditions other than dishonorable may be classified as one or more of the four Protected Veteran categories:\nDisabled Veteran\nA veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military and is entitled to disability compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to disability compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\nRecently Separated Veteran\nA veteran separated during the three-year period beginning on the date of the veteran‚Äôs discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military.\nArmed Forces Service Medal Veteran\nA veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, participated in a U.S. military operation that received an Armed Forces service medal.\nOther Protected Veteran (listed in Workday as Active Duty Wartime or Campaign Badge Veteran)\nA veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge was authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\nIn our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) Workday, on the Job tab page, in the Equal Employment Opportunity section, we have a field titled\nProtected Veteran Status\nthat we ask our US-based team members to complete during the onboarding process. The reason we ask is because it is a legal requirement in the United States for us to request this information. We encourage GitLab team members to self-disclose in our HRIS without any fear of judgment or negative consequences, but it is always optional. All veteran status data is completely confidential, and only requested for mandatory reporting purposes.\nThe options of this field are:\nYes, I am a US Veteran with a Protected Status\nNot Applicable\nPrefer Not to Answer\nAbove this field, we have a section titled\nVeteran Status\nthat we ask our US-based team members to review and also complete during the onboarding process, if it applies to them and if they so wish. The reason we ask is because it is a legal requirement in the United States for us to request and document this information. We encourage our US-based GitLab team members to self-disclose their Veteran Status in our HRIS without any fear of judgment or negative consequences, but it is always optional. Again, all veteran status data is completely confidential, and only requested for mandatory reporting purposes.\nIf you are a team member on a GitLab Inc or Federal contract and a disabled veteran you may request a ‚Äúreasonable accommodation.‚Äù A reasonable accommodation is one that allows you to perform your job, and must be provided by GitLab unless doing so would cause GitLab significant difficulty or expense. A reasonable accommodation does not change essential job functions. GitLab can choose the type of reasonable accommodation that will be made available; however, the accommodation must be effective. More information on how to request a reasonable accommodation is available\nhere\n. Please review the\nreasonable accommodation\nhandbook section if you would like an accommodation due to your veteran status.\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging Learning & Development\nProcess for learning material and course creators\nTeam members who might use this process include:\nDIB and L&D team members, managers creating training for their teams, departments creating required compliance training, team members creating training for their peers or community, Developer Relations creating training for the wider GitLab community\nWhen a new training is created or curated open up an issue using the\nfollowing template\n. It is best to open this issue\nas soon as you‚Äôve begun building out the learning material\n* so that the DIB and L&D team can provide early guidance\nAssign the issue to a DIB Team Member and a L&D team member - the assignees must not be someone who participated in creating or curating the training\nThe assignees will go through the content of the training and complete the QA process as outlined in the issue.\nThe content creator and assignees will use the issue to collaborate on and document improvements made to the content that align with quality check list above\nWhen all 3 participants agree that the course has met our inclusion and learning standards, close the issue and proceed with adding the materials or course to GitLab Learn\nCommunity\nGitLab team members are distributed across the globe, giving us access to an array of opportunity.\nWe encourage collaboration with global organizations and programs that support underrepresented individuals in the tech industry.\nGitLab also provides additional support through the\nGitLab Diversity Sponsorship program\n.\nWe offer funds to help support the event financially, and if the event is in a city we have a GitLab team member, we get hands-on by offering to coach and/or give a talk whenever possible.\nWe encourage organizers of events that are supported through our\nGitLab Diversity Sponsorship program\nto share\nthis sign up link\nwith attendees. Everyone can contribute.\nDefinitions\nGender and Sexual Orientation Identity Definitions and FAQ\nLeadership\nis defined as director and above.\nGeographically\nis defined as those countries we use in our identity data.\nWomen is the term GitLab uses instead of ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù. ‚ÄúFemale/Male‚Äù are gender terms often designated at birth. ‚ÄúWoman/Man‚Äù are gender terms based on self-identification. At GitLab, we define women based on how team members self-identify their gender in Workday.\nRace\n- To understand our representation, we want to do our best in having categories for race that team members can select where they are able to in some way identify with the options available. These definitions align with the EEOC:\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\n- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. This category includes people who indicate their race as American Indian, Alaska Native, Navajo, Blackfeet, Inupiat, Yup‚Äôik, Central American Indian groups or South American Indian groups.\nAsian\n- A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including but not limited to: Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. This includes people who indicate their race as Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and or other not mentioned Asian identifies.\nBlack\n- A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa. Including people who indicate their race as Black or African American, Cape Coloreds, Carribean, Kenyan, Nigerian, or Haitian.\nHispanic or LatinX\n- A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, ‚ÄúSpanish origin‚Äù, can be used in addition to ‚ÄúHispanic or Latino‚Äù. Although not of Spanish-origin, Brazil is also included in this category due its inclusion in the LatinX definition.\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\n- A person having origins in any of the original people of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. Included but not limited to people who reported their race as Fijian, Guamanian, Chamorro, Marshallese, Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongan or other Pacific Islander.\nMultiracial\n- refers to two or more races as described in the listed categories.\nWhite\n- A person having origins in any of the original people of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. Included but not limited to people who indicate their race as: White, Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Arab, Moroccan, or Caucasian.\nEthnicity\n: Can be more broadly defined as ‚Äúlarge groups of people classed according to common racial, national, tribal, religious, linguistic, or cultural origin or background.‚Äù\nFor example people who are Black/African Descent can have a variety of ethnicities such as African,  African American, Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Latinx etc. Whilst physical characteristics can be similar there could be cultural differences.\nUnderrepresented Group\nThis can be defined as a group whose percentage of the population in a given group is lower than their percentage of the population of country, community, organization or otherwise.\nAn example of this at GitLab is: Women within Senior Leadership is still low compared to Men within Senior Leadership. Which meant that GitLab created the goal of 50% of all senior leadership should be women by December 2021 to address the imbalance within this underrepresented group.\nTMRG (Team Member Resource Group)\n- In other organizations, a TMRG can be an ERG (Employee Resource Group). TMRGs are voluntary, team member-led groups focused on fostering diversity, inclusion and belonging within GitLab. These groups help team members build stronger internal and external connections; offer social, educational, and outreach activities; create development opportunities for future leaders; and increase engagement among team members.\nAlly\n- A diversity, inclusion and belonging ‚Äúally‚Äù is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community.\nAllyship\n- Is the state of being an ally, supporting or being a member of  groups or associations of the people you are an ally too. An example of this is someone who does not identify as part of the\ncommunity being a part of the TMRG and supporting the endeavors.\nUnconscious bias\n- Unconscious biases are stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness.\nNearly all our thoughts and actions are influenced, at least in part, by unconscious impulses. There‚Äôs no reason bias should be out of scope. Categorizing people based on social and other characteristics is a powerful survival mechanism, as it helps to distinguish friends from foes and make quick ‚Äúlife or death‚Äù decisions based on ‚Äúinner feeling‚Äù. At the same time this is a fertile ground for growing stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination.\nPsychological safety\n- is defined by Amy Edmondson as a ‚Äúshared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking‚Äù.\nIt‚Äôs not about being warm and fuzzy and sharing your feelings. It‚Äôs about being comfortable admitting when you are wrong or have made a mistake as well as challenging each other for the better.\nPerformance Indicators\nGitLab Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging 2023\nEveryone means everyone Inclusion has always been at the heart of GitLab.

{"doc_id": "b31be2cf4b48b8ac", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses", "title": "Global Travel and Expense Policy | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nFinance\nGlobal Travel and Expense Policy\nGitLab‚Äôs Global Travel & Expense Policy is meant to provide guidance to all Team Members to ensure that we act in the best interest of our Company at all times. The purpose of this policy is to:\nProvide guidance around allowable reimbursable expenses.\nEnsure the best utilization of our Team Member‚Äôs time.\nDrive transparency across all business travel related spend.\nHelp Team Members understand that a centralized travel program results in improved safety, visibility, support and savings.\nPrevent violations of applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws.\n2. Responsibilities\nTeam Members\n:\nAs a public company, GitLab has an obligation to act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. This obligation is shared by all Team Members and is the basis of our global travel and expense policy as a public company; Team Members must be thoughtful in spending the company‚Äôs money.\nUse best judgment to ensure that all travel is business critical and all expenses are deemed ‚Äúordinary and necessary‚Äù. Team Members should consider conducting meetings via audio or video conferencing when appropriate.\nRead, understand and adhere to GitLab‚Äôs Global Travel & Expense policy.\nTeam Members are also expected to inform their direct manager of all business trip plans prior to booking to ensure that the proposed trip is within their departmental budget. Team Members must receive Manager approval for any proposed business critical trips.\nSubmit all expenses timely. All Team Members should submit expenses by the end of the fiscal quarter in which the expense was incurred. GitLab‚Äôs fiscal quarter end dates are January 31, April 30, July 31, October 31.\nFollow-up with your manager or the AP team if they haven‚Äôt approved your expense report.\nManagers and/or Budget Owners\n:\nEnsure that Team members‚Äô expenses are in compliance with GitLab‚Äôs Global Travel & Expense policy.\nWe ask that managers set pre-trip awareness expectations within their teams to ensure that trips are business critical and budgeted for.\nPlease work with your respective Finance Partner to know your specific team‚Äôs budget and amount spent to date.\nManagers are expected to review their team‚Äôs expenses in their entirety every month, and must flag any concerns immediately to the Accounts Payable team. Potential violations of GitLab‚Äôs expense Policy as it relates to gifts and entertainment should also be flagged to the Legal department in a manner consistent with\nGitLab‚Äôs Whistleblower Policy\n.\nManagers will be required to sign off that they have reviewed their team‚Äôs expenses.\nManagers will be held accountable for any unreported abuse by their Team Members.\nAP will flag Managers if further information is required for their direct reports.\nPlease see the attached\nManager Policy\nfor more details.\nAccounting\n:\nMaintain and communicate the Global Travel & Expense Policy out to the Company on a regular cadence as updates occur.\nEnsure that expense reports are in compliance with the  Global Travel & Expense Policy.\nProvide clear and timely feedback to Team Members and managers regarding missing information, general questions, or ‚Äúout of policy‚Äù issues, and escalate potential violations of the gifts and entertainment expense rules to the Legal department in a manner consistent with GitLab‚Äôs\nWhistleblower Policy\n.\nReview and process all expense reports that require AP Admin review, within 7 working days from the date submitted.\nFinance\n:\nMaintain departmental budgets for Travel and Entertainment and Offsites.\nWork with respective Business Partners to provide specific team budgets and amounts spent to date.\n3. General Guidelines\nTeam members should submit receipts for every business expense. For Non-US Team Members, receipts are required for all expenses. US Team Members are required to only submit receipts for any expenses over $50 USD.  Receipts must contain vendor name, date of purchase, listing of what was purchased, and contains a full breakout of the subtotal and tax amounts. Snapshot from phone/computer screen of Applications, Card/Bank Statements are not an acceptable form of receipt.\nTeam Members are not allowed to expense items on behalf of their managers.\nPayments, gifts, favors, or entertainment for officials, employees, or representatives of government-owned entities are strictly prohibited, regardless of value.\nExpense claims for a single item up to $5,000 can be expensed via Navan. >$5,000 needs to go through the procurement process in Zip.\nExpense claims over 90 days from purchase date will not be reimbursed unless approved by the Manager.\nNavan Description box: Expense items must have a description filled out. This box is showing as optional but we require this to be filled in. This helps to correctly record the transaction and assist any reporting purposes downstream.\nWhen filling in the description box , we ask for you to enter details of the expense so anyone looking at the line on a report can tell immediately (without the need of looking at the receipt) what the expense relates to and why it is claimed.\nPlease fill in the description box with details like : Items Purchased/Claimed, Period service relates to, Trip Details this claim relates to, Reason for trip, Clients Name, etc. If left blank, the expense will be bounced back to the team member to complete this portion.\nThe maximum monthly limit to be reimbursed is $10K USD (or local currency equivalent). Once this limit has been reached, all expense items will need to be approved by the A/P team in Navan.  This limit may be increased for Team Members whose positions require more spend (eg. Field Marketing), but the increase request needs to be submitted via an issue for approval by the VP or higher in the Accounting Organization. Due to the nature of their roles, E-Group members have a maximum monthly limit to be reimbursed of $20K USD before additional approvals are required.\nExpenditures related to client entertainment or marketing must be necessary, prudent, and job-related.\nExpenses that span longer than a month must be submitted on a monthly basis (eg. Although you paid for a year upfront for the internet, you must divide the total by 12 months and submit the cost monthly), with the exception of VPN.\nGift cards are not accepted as a form of payment for business expenses.\nExpense items must clearly state if the spend includes amounts for clients / non-Team Members. Tax requirements in certain countries require us to account for client spending differently.\nAnything submitted outside of these guidelines will be flagged as Out of Policy.\nAll work-related expenses (internet, co-working space, other monthly subscription, etc.) are not reimbursable while on Leave of any kind.\nFor PEO‚Äôs, as you are aware with Navan, the system will automatically reimburse in the currency of the GitLab organization you are employed. To ensure you are reimbursed in the currency in which your PEO needs to be invoiced please submit your expenses in the payment currency you will be invoicing the PEO in. i.e. if you invoice your PEO in USD, then convert the expense into USD prior to submitting the expense report in Navan. This will then allow you to know the exact amount to invoice the PEO every month. If this is not doable then we will convert the currency using the FX rates from Netsuite on the day this expense is transferred to payroll for payment to the PEO. To find out the actual amount submitted in Navan, we can provide you a list of the expenses submitted for each month.  Please request this monthly by submitting a\nHelpLab\nticket so we can provide you the needed information.\nAs with any third-party, it is best practice to limit the amount of personal data shared. The inclusion of personal data on your receipts is not required to submit an expense, so feel free to redact personal data for increased privacy. However, this is not a required step. For those that choose not to redact personal data from your expense receipts, the privacy and security controls in place at Navan were evaluated and they are designed to adequately protect your information.\n3.1 Out of Policy Transactions\nNote that when expenses are flagged as ‚ÄúOut of Policy‚Äù in Navan, this does not necessarily mean the expense is ‚ÄúOut of Policy‚Äù. It can also mean that additional review is needed due to a requirement for  certain attachments (eg. an approved issue) and/or additional approvals.\nUpon review, if more clarification is needed for a certain expense, the AP team will contact the Team Member in the Navan tool to ask for justification of the transaction before approving or rejecting the expense.\nThe AP team will reach out to the Team Member‚Äôs manager if additional approval is needed.\nIf the claim is over the advised guidance, the claim will be rejected with a note for the Team Member. The Team Member should be able to rectify the claim and resubmit.\nWhere the Team Member has already received approval from the manager, that approval should be attached as a receipt on the claim transaction.\nAny claim made which does not fall into the policy is not reimbursable.  If an item is out of policy and approved by your manager, then please obtain and attach your manager‚Äôs approval email prior to submitting the expense. This will then be reviewed by the Expense team Admin and could need further approval from VP or higher in the Accounting Organization.\nThere will be occasions where if you have claimed an item and it needs to be reimbursed back to GitLab, you will need to follow the repayment process in Navan for submission of the funds.\n3.2 Trip Purpose Guidance\nWhen booking travel in Navan, it‚Äôs important to select the proper trip purpose type from the ‚ÄúTrip Purpose‚Äù dropdown menu. Selecting the correct trip type is essential for accurate data reporting.\nThe options for trip purpose include:\nCompany meeting - any travel for internal meetings or events (that are not listed separately) with no customers present\nCustomer visit - any travel for meetings or events where GitLab customers and prospects are in attendance including conferences, roadshows, field events, and customer meetings\nPartner visit - any travel for meetings or events where GitLab partners are in attendance\nSpecific events - these will be visible in the trip purpose dropdown, ex:\nFY25 GTM Onsite\n3.3 Other\nOut of Policy Transactions for all E-Group Members needs to be approved by VP or higher in the Accounting Organization.\nAny exceptions to the policy must be documented via an issue or an email with proper approvals from their manager and Finance team.\nPayment method\nGitLab‚Äôs default payment method in Navan is a central company card.\nPayment varies based on travel transaction type - air, hotel, car or rail (where applicable).\nAirfare: All airfare is charged immediately at the time of booking to the card on file. GitLab‚Äôs central card is the default payment method in the system and will always be available.\nFollowing expenses are categorized for reimbursement purposes with specific policy definition attached to it. The limits below are in USD, please use local currency equivalents when considering other currencies.\n4.1 TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES\nAirfare\nAll business related flights need to be booked through Navan, and will be paid by GitLab travel card. For each flight search, Navan determines the price in real time. Also to note that while it is sometimes possible to find a cheaper flight outside of Navan, we get overall better rates in the aggregate with the buying power of the whole company. Even if a flight is cheaper outside of Navan, please book in Navan. Also submit a request under the\nExpenses -> Travel Related Expenses\npage of\nHelpLab\nwith screenshots of Navan‚Äôs rate and the other airlines rate so the Expense team can address with Navan.\nAdvance Purchase\nTeam Members should make air reservations as early as possible, in order to take advantage of discounted fares. Travelers will ideally book:\nDomestic: At least 14 days in advance\nInternational: At least 21 days in advance\nThe airfare policy in Navan is set up as a ‚ÄúDynamic Policy‚Äù which calculates a fair market price for every search based on travel dates and destinations. Any purchases that are over 20% of the Dynamic Policy will be flagged for further review by your manager. Also note that anything booked outside of Navan will flag as ‚ÄúOut of Policy‚Äù, and will need to be reviewed by your manager and the AP team.\nClass of Service\nOne class of upgrade is permitted with Manager approval for team members over 6'5\"/2m in height.\nDomestic Flights\nFlights over 5 hours of consecutive flight time\n- For domestic flights with a duration greater than 5 hours of consecutive flight time (each segment must be 5+ hours), team members are authorized to book the next class up from standard economy as long as it is below business class.\nInternational Flights\nFlights greater than 5 hours of consecutive flight time\n- For international flights with a duration greater than 5 hours of consecutive flight time (each segment must be 5+ hours), team members are authorized to book the next class up from standard economy as long as it is below business class.\nFlights exceeding 8 hours of consecutive flight time\n- For those who travel frequently, defined as 3 or more trips per quarter internationally on flights of 8 hrs+ continuous flight time (minimum 6 flight segments with 8+ hours per segment), business class is permitted when traveling for any of the following reasons:\nMeeting with customers\nSpeaking engagement\nRepresenting GitLab at a conference\nFrequent Flyer Programs\nParticipation in frequent flyer programs must not influence airfare selection if it results in an out-of-policy option.\nTeam Members may use personal frequent flyer miles or points for upgrades on business travel, however, Team Members will not be reimbursed for any respective charges.\nCancellations, Unused Tickets and Exchanges\nTeam Members are responsible for canceling trips that they will no longer be able to attend.\nFlight cancellations typically result in flight credit/unused tickets that can be used going forward.\nUnused tickets must be used for future business travel whenever possible. If the Team Member knows they won‚Äôt be able to use the ticket, please submit a request under the\nExpenses -> Travel Related Expenses\npage of\nHelpLab\n.\nTeam Members may not personally benefit from any unused airline tickets.\nPlease reach out to Navan Support if you need to change a flight.\nCommon Out-of-policy Airfare Flags in Navan\nThe system automatically flags the following as out-of-policy:\nFlight price selected is more expensive than the cheapest option + our buffer\nOut-of-policy air class is selected\nFlights booked less than 14 days in advance\nIf the flight selected triggers any of these criteria, an email will automatically be sent to your manager for approval. Please provide sufficient reasoning to make approval easier and faster.\nAfter 24 hours without any manual action (approved/denied) the booking will automatically be accepted.\nCoding\nExpense Type / Navan Policy Category:\nAirfare\nCar Rental\nRental Cars are reimbursable and should be booked through Navan, up to the intermediate car class, with a 7 day booking lead time. Rental Cars are reimbursable and should be booked through Navan, up to the intermediate car class, with a 7 day booking lead time.\nPlease note that anything booked outside of Navan will flag as ‚ÄúOut of Policy‚Äù, and will need to be reviewed by your manager and the AP team.\nNavan Confirmation should be attached to the claim along with the Car Rental Receipt.\nTeam Members can claim gas expenses but not mileage, when renting a car.\nFuel at $300 limit per day.\nAdditional Car Rental Guidelines\nA. Third Party Liability\nPurchase the liability insurance that is excess of the standard inclusion of State minimum coverage in the rental agreement at the rental agency. GitLab‚Äôs insurance policy provides liability insurance for rental cars while conducting company business, but it may be excess over any underlying liability coverage through the driver or credit card company used to purchase the rental.\nPurchase the liability offered at the rental counter if there are Non-US Team Members renting autos in the US or Canada. While workers‚Äô compensation would protect an injured US Team Member, other passengers may have the right to sue. To ensure that GitLab has protection when a Non-US Team Member invites another person into the car we recommend the purchase of this insurance when offered at the rental counter.\nB. Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver\nDo Not purchase the Collision Damage Waiver offered at the rental counter. GitLab purchases coverage for damage to rented vehicles. If travel to Mexico is required, purchase the liability insurance for Mexico offered at the rental counter. You should verify that the rental agreement clearly states that the vehicle may be driven into Mexico and liability coverage will apply.\nCountries other than the US and Canada:\nThird Party Liability\nPurchase the liability insurance offered at the rental counter when traveling outside the US and Canada. Automobile Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability insurance are required by law in almost every country. Please verify this coverage is included with the rental agreement.\nPhysical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver\nPurchase the Collision Damage Waiver or Physical Damage Coverage offered by the rental agency when traveling outside the US and Canada.\nIn the event of an accident resulting in damage to the rental car, the Non-US rental agency will charge the credit card used to make the reservation with an estimated amount of repair costs if insurance is not purchased. If this happens, GitLab does not purchase Foreign Corporate Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage to reimburse for damages.\nCoding\nExpense Type / Navan Policy Category:\nRental cars\nHotels\nTo be booked in Navan. When booked outside Navan - approval required by Manager and AP Admin.\nWhen you book Hotels through Navan Travel, the costs will need to be charged to a personal credit card.\nFor business related bookings, you can submit the costs for reimbursement via the Navan Expense reimbursement tool.\nPlease attach the Navan Reservation email confirmation to the claim.\nHotel stays are reimbursable up to $300 USD (or equivalent local currency) inclusive of tax per night for standard rooms, with a 7 day booking lead time.\nHowever, the lodging policy in Navan is set up as a ‚ÄúDynamic Policy‚Äù which calculates a fair market price for every search based on travel dates and destinations. This allows for some room in price in case the $300 USD limit is really not applicable to that area. And similar to airfare, any purchases that are over 20% of the Dynamic Policy will be flagged for further review by your manager.\nAlways choose the refundable room booking unless the only available option is a non refundable room.\nThe exception is the Corporate Events hotel room blocks organized by the internal team or if the conference hotel room block has better pricing than Navan.\nThe hotel room block‚Äôs pricing is generally within the bounds of the $300USD/night and in the event it is over that amount, please contact the AP team for an exception to be granted.\nConference hotel room blocks or Corporate Events organized blocks will still need to be charged to a personal credit card and then submitted for reimbursement via Navan Expense.\nAlways bring a credit card with you when traveling for company business if you have one. Hotels will generally expect you to have a physical credit card to present upon check-in. This credit card will be kept on file for the duration of your stay. Even if your lodging was pre-paid by the company or by using a company credit card, the Hotel may still require a card to be on file for ‚Äúincidentals‚Äù.\nAdditional Hotel Guidelines\nDry cleaning is allowable if the stay is over 5 days. Room service is allowable as a meal for e.g. breakfast/lunch/dinner.\nMeals are to be segregated from the hotel bill and tagged under ‚ÄúMeals Company Provided‚Äù Category.\nParking must be segregated and tagged under ‚ÄúTransportation‚Äù.\nMovies, mini bars are not allowed as a claim.\nBooking accommodations through Airbnb\nTo be booked on the AIRBNB platform. Same restrictions in amount applies as the hotel expense.\nBooking through Airbnb is permitted if it is cheaper than a hotel stay for your trip\nTeam Member to submit a manual expense in Navan using expense type ‚ÄúLodging‚Äù and attach the receipt/invoice.\nSelf Stay Incentive Policy\nIf you decide to stay with friends or family instead of a hotel / Airbnb for a business trip, you may expense up to a $50 appropriate host/hostess gift.\nCoding\nExpense Type / Navan Policy Category:\nLodging\nMeals: Company Provided while Traveling\nMeals while traveling on Company business  are reimbursable, up to $100 USD (or local equivalent currency) per day.\nEach Team Member must submit their own receipts for reimbursement, so ensure to separate billing when going to meals with groups of Team Members. If this is not practicable to do due to the group size, then the most senior Team Member present should pay the bill and submit for reimbursement.\nTo be used for team activities and food/beverages associated with travel on Company business. Refer to our Travel Handbook Page.\nTips are acceptable up to 20% and should be detailed accordingly in the description box.

We provide support and guidance to uphold consistent business processes around the protection of personal data as it relates to GitLab customers, users, Team Members, and other natural persons. We collaborate cross-functionally and serve as advocates to ensure that the data privacy practices of GitLab meet the needs of our cross-functional partners and are continually balanced with an ever-changing global data privacy and protection landscape.\nWhat is data privacy\nPrivacy Terms\nVendor Privacy Review Process\nInternal Product Feature/Release Privacy Review\nGuidelines for Law Enforcement Requests\nCustomer Product Usage Information\nand\nUsage Events FAQs\nPrivacy Statement Links\nGitLab Privacy Statement\nGitLab Cookie Policy\nGitLab Team Member Privacy Notice\nContact the Team\nSlack channel - #legal is the best place for questions relating to our team that do not require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information.\nFor issues that require action from the Privacy Team, apply the label\nPrivacy::Intake\n. This will update the\nPrivacy Legal Issue Board\nand allow the team to triage the issue appropriately. We also use the following labels:\nPrivacy::In Process\n- when the Privacy Team is actively working on the issue\nPrivacy::Pending Requestor\n- when the Privacy Team has a requirement or task that must be met by the business owner before the issue progresses\nPrivacy::Done\n- when the Privacy Team has finished their portion of the issue\nPrivacy::Attention\nfor awareness only, no action needed.\nFor sensitive, private, or confidential requests email\nlegal_internal@gitlab.com\n. Please do not send emails to this address for engineering, marketing, sales or procurement requests. These should be directed to #legal or an issue should be created in the\nLegal and Compliance\nproject.\nWhat Data Privacy Means\nTell people what you are doing with personal data and why you are doing it so that the person can make an informed decision about whether they want to allow it to happen. Do not be creepy about what personal data is collected or how it is used and do not change the way personal data is used without first giving people notice and an opportunity to object, or, where required, obtaining prior consent. Make it easy for people to tell us their privacy preferences and honor those preferences even if they change over time. Build a product or service that has privacy-focused settings turned on by default and let the consumer decide if and when they want to change that. Transparency is a core value and every team member is responsible for the proper collection and use of personal data consistent with our\nPrivacy Statement\n.\nPrivacy Terms\nPrivacy Term Definitions\nAnonymization\nThe process of permanently and irreversibly altering personal data in a way that it is no longer capable of being related back to a specific individual.\nConsent\nA freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of an individual‚Äôs wishes. Consent is captured by an un-ticked checkbox or other unequivocal statement which signifies agreement to the processing of personal data before or at the time of collection.\nData Classification\nA method of determining types of data associated by risk. See\nGitLab Security Data Classification Standards\nfor more information.\nData Controller\nA natural or legal person, agency, or other entity which alone, or jointly with others, determines the purpose and means of processing personal data. For example, GitLab is a Data Controller is in the areas of marketing and sales where the personal data of prospects and leads is managed solely at our discretion. GitLab also serves as a Data Controller for all personal data collected from Team Members for employment purposes and any administration of benefits.\nData Processor\nA natural or legal person, agency, or other entity which processes personal data on behalf of a Data Controller. GitLab acts as a Data Processor when we manage personal data native to a Customer‚Äôs instance or namespace.  GitLab acts as a Processor in these situations because the Customer is the ultimate owner of the data it submits to the service offerings, and our contracts service as Customer‚Äôs instructions to GitLab regarding the processing of their data.\nData Subject\nAn identified or identifiable natural person.\nData Subject Rights\nRights granted to individuals in relation to personal data or information processed about them.  Because Data Subjct Rights are instrumental to the privacy and protection of data subjects, many of these rights are codified under global privacy legislation, such as the GDPR, CCPA, and LGDP. If a business processes personal data pursuant to certain bases such as consent or legitimate interest, then a data subject may assert one of its fundamental rights and a business is obligated to respond under law.  The rights granted vary slightly by country, region, province or state. GitLab treats all users and Team Members the same and will respond to a data subject request from any individual user or team member even if they live in a country, region, or state/province without specific data protection laws. Expand the following section for more information about the data subject rights available.\nData Subject Rights\nRight of Access\nA request seeking access to the specific pieces of personal data that have been collected and used by a Data Controller.\nRight to Correct\nA request asking for inaccurate or incomplete personal data to be corrected.\nRight to Delete\nA request which seeks the erasure of personal data relating to the data subject. Deletion requests must meet certain conditions and businesses are not required to delete any personal data that is processed to meet legal obligations, including that data which may be processed in pursuit or in defense of claims.\nRight to Portability\nA request where the data subject wants to transfer their data to another Data Controller; typically seen when the individual changes service providers that share a compatible electronic filing system.\nRight to Restrict Processing\nThis is a request for the Data Controller to stop processing personal data under certain circumstances. This may also include a request to limit the use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data.\nRight to Object\nA request to opt-out of all data processing or specific processing of personal data based on consent or legitimate interest. Generally this is a request to opt-out of processing for targeted advertising, which includes the sale or sharing of personal data for profiling or cross-context behavioral advertising.\nRight Not to be Subject to Fully Automated Decisions\nThis is a request that the data subject not be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which would have a significant legal impact. An example might be an algorithm that excludes someone of a certain race from obtaining a credit card.\nA Data Protection Impact Assessment is a method to review and document identified privacy compliance risks, as well as evalute higher risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, including any that pose potential for significant harm. Learn more about GitLab‚Äôs process for completing DPIAs\nhere\n.\nPersonal Data\nAny data, individually or when combined with other data, that identifies, relates to, describes or is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an identifiable natural person (a ‚Äòdata subject‚Äô), whether directly or indirectly. See also, Sensitive Personal Data.\nPrivacy by Default\nA concept that should be implemented at the product development stage and uses appropriate measures to ensure that, by default, the only personal data processed is what is truly necessary. In practice, this means a user‚Äôs privacy settings prioritize privacy in their default state.\nPrivacy by Design\nA concept which focuses on intentionally designing a product that incorporates foundational privacy principles and ensures that Controllers and Processors are able to fulfill data protection obligations. This may include appropriate technical and organizational measures such as pseudonymisation and encryption.\nPseudonymization\nThe process of altering personal data so that it can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional re-identifying information.  In order to practice successful Pseudonymization, the re-identifying information should be kept separate from the pseudonymized data.\nPublicly Available Personal Data\nRefers to personal data that is publicly available from federal, state, or local government records or made manifestly public by the data subject. Under limited data privacy laws this may also include personal data made public through widely distributed media.\nSensitive Personal Data\nData that is particularly personal and intimately tied to the core identity of a person. This type of data generally includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data related to health, data related to sex life or sexual orientation, criminal offenses, and citizenship/immigraion status.  In some jurisdictions, Sensitive Personal Data includes government identifiers and financial data.\nPrivacy Review Process\nEvery vendor that handles personal data is required to go through a Privacy Review prior to being onboarded, which includes completion and approval of the privacy due diligence questionnaires detailed in the\nProcurement process\n. Certain vendors who are classified as handling red or orange data under our\nData Classification Standards\nare reviewed annually. Additionally, when new product features are designed, there are times when a formal privacy review is required.\nThis section outlines the process for these reviews.\nVendor Privacy Review\ngraph TD\nA[Evaluating Potential<br> New Vendor] --> Did1[(Is there a Zip Request?)]\nB[Pilot with<br> New Vendor] --> Did1[(Is there a Zip Request?)]\nC[Renewing<br> Vendor] --> Did1[(Is there a Zip Request?)]\nDid1 --> E1[Yes]\nDid1 --> E2[No]\nE1 --> F[Privacy Review runs<br> concurrently with <br> Security and Legal in Zip]\nE2 --> G[Is there an existing Issue?]\nG --> H1[Yes]\nG --> H2[No]\nH1 --> I[Add Privacy::Intake<br> label to the Issue]\nH2 --> J[Create New Issue]\nF --> K[Privacy Review SLA<br> is 2 weeks]\nK --> L[If DPIA required<br> SLA for DPIA<br> is 4 weeks]\nL --> M[Approved?]\nM --> N1[Yes]\nM --> N2[No]\nN1 --> O[Process Complete<br> Approved]\nN2 --> P[Third-Party Risk<br> Acceptance Required]\nclick Did1 \"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide/\"\nclick J \"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Vendor-Procurement-Privacy-Review.md\" _blank\nclick P \"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Third-Party-Risk-Acceptance.md\" _blank\nstyle A fill:#E6E6FA\nstyle B fill:#E6E6FA\nstyle C fill:#E6E6FA\nstyle Did1 fill:#FF8C00\nstyle E1 fill:#C0C0C0\nstyle E2 fill:#C0C0C0\nstyle F fill:#FF8C00\nstyle G fill:#FF8C00\nstyle H1 fill:#C0C0C0\nstyle H2 fill:#C0C0C0\nstyle I fill:#98FB98\nstyle J fill:#98FB98\nstyle K fill:#ADD8E6\nstyle L fill:#ADD8E6\nstyle M fill:#FF8C00\nstyle N1 fill:#C0C0C0\nstyle N2 fill:#C0C0C0\nstyle O fill:#2E8B57\nstyle P fill:#DC143C\nFor Third-Party Risk Acceptance, any Moderate/High risk requires VP and/or above approval\nInternal Privacy Review\nInternal Product Feature/Release Privacy Review Process\nAnytime a new feature or a change to an existing feature is planned, Product Managers and Engineering Managers should evaluate if the planned development presents a legal risk where personal data is involved.

Please find our internal processes in the\nAccounting and Reporting\ninternal handbook section.\nQuote to cash\nInvoicing to customers\nCalculated Billings\nCalculated billings is defined as revenue plus the sequential change in total deferred revenue as presented on the balance sheet.\nWe do not believe that calculated billings provides a meaningful indicator of financial performance as billings can be impacted by timing volatility of renewals, co-terming upgrades and multi year prepayment of subscriptions.\nFor order approval and invoicing process please view the\nBilling Ops page.\nInvoicing: One Time Events\nSend the below information via email to\nar@gitlab.com\nCompany name\nCompany AP email\nAddress\nBilling contact name\nBilling contact email\nCharge amount\nEvent name and subject\nAmendments to Subscriptions\nTo amend a customer‚Äôs account, choose one of the options below from the subscription page in Zuora.\nTerms and Conditions - used to change the end date of a product\nNew Product - choose when adding a product\nUpdate a product - choose when making a change to a current product\nRemove a product - used when removing a product\nRenewal\nZuora Subscription Data Management\nBasic Assumptions\nSubscriptions should only be cancelled with 45 days of the start. Exceptions can be made (see\nSupport Workflows\n)\nSubscriptions can be linked across multiple Zuora and SalesForce (SFDC) Accounts, but not SFDC Ultimate Parent Accounts.\nAll Zuora Accounts must be linked to a valid SFDC Account.\nMRR can change historically due to customer behavior (renewals, cancellations, etc.)\nNew Accounts vs New Subscriptions\nThere are instances where a new account in Zuora is required rather than just a new subscription in an existing account. This is determined by the sold-to contact person.\nWithin the customer account portal, customers can only see a single Zuora account at a time. If a customer wants to add a subscription and the contact information is the same, then the subscription can be added to the existing account.\nIf a customer wants an additional subscription for a different sold to contact, then a new Zuora account will be created so that every sold to contact can log into the portal and manage their subscriptions.\nLinking Renewal Subscriptions\nWhen a customer renews their subscription, a new subscription is typically created. This can create challenges for calculating metrics like dollar retention for a subscription because once subscription has ended and another has started. To address this, a linkage is made between the original subscription and its renewal(s).\nThe field\nRenewal subscription\nis used to create the mapping. These are the following constraints on this field:\nThis field defines a unidirectional relationship that points to a separate subscription name.\nA renewal subscription can start on the same or future day as the original subscription start date to which it is linked to, but never in the past.\nAny number of subscriptions can point to the same renewal subscription as long as the time constraint is met.\nA subscription may have any number of renewal subscriptions that it points to as long as the time constraint is met. This is a one-to-many relationship. Each renewal subscription to which the original subscription is linked is input in the field and are separated by two pipes.\nFor example, subscription\nis linked to\nRenewal subscriptions can point to subscriptions under separate Zuora Accounts\nRenewal subscriptions can start 12 months or less after the original subscription. Practically, this is because a linkage of greater than 12 months has no effect on any relevant metrics (Retention or Yearly counts).\nThe process to make the linkage is as follows:\nCancel the old subscription in Zuora.\nCopy and paste the new subscription in ‚ÄúRenewal Subscription‚Äù field with no trailing spaces.\nZuora subscription status ‚Äòactive‚Äô\nThe active subscription status in Zuora needs to be reviewed in connection to the end date.\nIf the end date is in the future it means that the subscription is still within the term and the customer is able to use the product.\nAn ‚Äòactive‚Äô subscription with an end date in the past means that the subscription was not renewed and the customer doesn‚Äôt have access to the product since the end date.\nWe currently don‚Äôt actively cancel these subscriptions as this is a manual process and the cancellation or lack of it does not have any impact on other processes.\nAdditionally, where subscriptions remain in an active status they can be renewed by the customers on the CustomersDot\nInvoice cancellations and refunds\nFor step by step processes please view\nBilling Ops page.\nHow to process a partial refund in Stripe\nLog in to Stripe.\nType in the cardholder‚Äôs name in the search field at the top of the screen.\nClick on the original charge that will be refunded.\nClick on the refund button.\nEnter in the amount to refund.\nEnter in the reason code.\nIn the description field, enter the reason for the refund and include the invoice that was created in Zuora for the refunded amount.\nClick on refund.\nGo back to Zuora.\nPut the customer account in silent mode under ‚ÄúCommunication Profile.‚Äù\nPost the invoice draft.\nTransfer to credit balance.\nAccounting Code: Stripe - Inc\nPut the customer account back into Default/B2B under ‚ÄúCommunication Profile.‚Äù\nVerify that the balance due is $0.00 on the refund invoice that was created.\nManually e-mail the customer, do not use Zuora to create the email as you cannot update the contents. Include a screenshot of the partial refund from Stripe and attach a copy of the refund invoice.\nAccounting for income from sale of merchandise\nPosting Swag Shop transactions in NetSuite\nTransactions from the Swag Shop are remitted to the Comerica checking account daily and should be booked in NetSuite at the end of each month.\nIn Shopify, download the transaction report in CSV format (found under Orders, then Export).\nThis report contains swag shop revenue and tax data to be recorded in NetSuite.\nIn portal used for swag download the orders report which should include cost for swag sold.\nRecord the revenue, tax, cost and cash received.

Fifty (50) percent of the balances that are Ninety (90) days or more after the due date and One Hundred (100) percent of the balances that are One Hundred and Twenty (120) days or more after the due date are reserved as allowance for doubtful debt. Bad debt expense is recorded based on revenue recognised, future revenue recognition is stopped and deferred revenue is reversed all at the Netsuite level.\nFuture amortisation of commissions expenses related to reserved invoices should also be stopped to ensure alignment with pattern of revenue recognition.\nAllowance for doubtful debt will be shared with Sales Operations on a monthly basis to ensure they have visibility of what may be written off in the future.\nOn a quarterly basis, Senior Billing Manager and Revenue Director will determine the aged invoices that are uncollectible. They will create an issue ten (10) days before the end of the quarter to seek approval according to the\nsignature auhorization matrix\nto write off invoices and to also notify the Sr. Director of Sales Operations. Sales Operations will then create decommission opportunities in SFDC for approved write offs before the end of the quarter and these will be synced to Zuora to reverse original invoicing and revenue. Sales Operations will claw back commissions accordingly.\nRevenue team will review write-offs processed in Zuora to ensure correct revenue reversal and will book MJEs in Netsuite to reclass impact to Bad Debt Reserve.\nCustomers that have had their invoices written off, consider no discounts or credit given for future deals.\nWhere payment is received for an invoice after it has been written off, the write off will be reversed and the related commission will be reinstated.\nProcure to Pay\nProcure to pay is the process of requisitioning, purchasing, receiving, paying for and accounting for goods and services. It includes the following sub processes of both the\nProcurement\nand\nAccounts Payable\ndepartments:\nVendor Master Management\nIf the vendor is not already set up in NetSuite it is considered a new vendor.\nAccording to the new vendor‚Äôs Legal Entity, they will be onboarded into Coupa.\nNew Vendor Onboarding - Coupa\nCoupa is a procure-to-pay system that streamlines the purchase request process, initiate workflow with approvals, and enable Purchase Orders.

The vendor is able to manage that directly within their Coupa Supplier Portal profile and either add a new legal entity (which will be associated with a new bank account) or adjust an existing one.\nInvoicing Section\n: If for some reason, a supplier is submitting their first invoice and they have not provided their banking information before they are creating their first invoice, that will create a new supplier payment account in Coupa.\nIf you are a GitLab vendor and you want to know more about how to update your CSP profile, check Coupa‚Äôs\nCreate or Update Your Profiles\ndocumentation.\nAfter the supplier submits their supplier payment account information, it will transfer into Coupa automatically and create a supplier payment account record.\nIf the supplier is going through the SIM process, the approval for that supplier payment account will occur directly on the SIM External Form, and AP won‚Äôt have to go into the supplier payment accounts to provide approval.\nFor more information regarding how to set up SPAs or Coupa Pay, please check out the lower section of our\nCoupa FAQ page\n.\nCreating a Batch in Coupa\nOnly Invoices in the ‚ÄúReady to Pay‚Äù status can be utilized to create a batch.\nInvoices can be removed from payment by Coupa Pay using the slider button under ‚ÄúActions‚Äù\n(in case a supplier is selected for Coupa pay but need to be paid out of NetSuite, switch their payment method to ERP)\n.\nThe ‚ÄúPay from Account‚Äù (Company Payment Account or CPA) will be automatically defaulted based on the Chart Of Accounts. The CPA can be adjusted manually by selecting the dropdown.\nThe ‚ÄúPay to Account‚Äù (Supplier Payment Account or SPA) will be defaulted based on the Remit-To entered on the invoice.\nApproving a Batch in Coupa\nApproval chains are generated before a payment batch can be released.\nSegregation of Duties:\nThe creator of the Batch cannot be the releasor of the same batch regardless of the permissions they have.\nCoupa Integration - troubleshooting for Payments\nA NetSuite error log identifying payment integration issues will be emailed to the Accounts Payable Team every Tuesday and Friday.

If any errors arise, AP will work out the errors until the report syncs into NetSuite.\nBillable Expenses\nIf you have an expense report that can be billed back to a customer please make sure to check the ‚Äúbillable‚Äù flag in Navan along with tagging the customer name under the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù field in Navan.\nPaying Navan Reports\nTeam members in a US expense policy will be automatically reimbursed through Navan after their report is ‚Äúfinal approved‚Äù within 1-4 business days.\nThe team member must set up their bank account in Navan.\nOnce an team member is reimbursed, Navan will auto sync the payment to the expense record to mark the report as reimbursed.\nThis will feed into NetSuite to show the bill as fully paid as well.\nTeam memebers in a country paid through PEO will also receive expense reimbursement through their same payroll PEO payments each month.\nPlease Note:\nThe timing of reimbursement can vary if you are being reimbursed directly from payroll, CXC, SafeGuard, Global PEO, Remote and/or iiPay.\nMore information on the timing of payouts can be found\nhere\nAll non-US GitLab entities will be reimbursed through their respective payroll provider or paid directly through GitLab‚Äôs Accounts Payable (AP) department with the normal weekly payment run.\nExpense report must have been ‚Äúfinal approved‚Äù no later than EOD Tuesday of that same week.\nAny report ‚Äúfinal approved‚Äù on Wednesday to Friday of that week will be reimbursed the following week.\nOnce an employee is reimbursed, AP will create the payment in NetSuite against the record to close the report as paid.\nAP will manually mark the expense reports as ‚ÄúReimbursed‚Äù in Navan once they are confirmed to the payroll provider or batched to Tipalti.\nPaying Navan Reports in Tipalti\nEntites included: GmbH, BV, PTY LTD, Ireland, IT BV and GK.\nAP will send the team member an auto generated email from Tipalti with instructions on how to onboard.\nOnly after a team member onboards themselves in Tipalti will payments be issued. Payee profile will show as ‚ÄúPayable‚Äù.\nAny team memebers hired after 2019-11-01 will be sent onboarding requests upon hire and/or upon first submission of an expense report.\nFurther details on the Expense reimbursement process can be found\nhere\nAccounts Payable Analyst Performance Indicators - Expenses\nAverage days to action <= 3 business days\nNumber of days from when an team member‚Äôs manager approves report to when AP analyst does final approval for payment or responds to team member in Navan if there is a concern. (Approval for payment is not the reimbursement date.) This is calculated on a calendar month basis. The target for this is currently three business days.\nTime to get a new team member set up in Navan < 3 business days\nHave new team member set up in Navan within 3 business days from team member start date.\nTravel and Expense Guidelines\nSpend reduction\nWhen reducing spend, we will not take the easy route of (temporarily) reducing discretionary spending.\nDiscretionary spending includes expenses like travel, conferences, gifts, bonuses, merit pay increases and summits.\nBy reducing in these areas we put ourselves at risk of\nincreasing voluntary turnover among the people we need most\n.\nDiscretionary spending is always subject to questioning, we are frugal and all spending needs to contribute to our goals.\nBut, we should not make cuts in reaction to the need to reduce spend; that would create a mediocre company with mediocre team members.\nInstead, we should do the hard work of identifying positions and costs that are not contributing to our goals.\nEven if this causes a bit more disruption in the short term, it will help us ensure we stay a great place to work for the people who are here.\nNon-Reimbursable Expenses\nIn order to purchase goods and services on behalf of the company, you should first\nconsult the Signature Authorization Matrix\nto determine the approval requirements. Note that this\ndoes not\ninclude travel expenses and other incidentals. These expenses should be self-funded then submitted for reimbursement within Navan, or in the case of independent contractors, included in invoices to the company (per the guidelines above).\nIf further approval is not required, then proceed to the Procurement\n‚ÄúWhat are you buying‚Äù page\nfor further instructions on the purchasing process at GitLab. Once those procedures are complete, have your vendor send their invoice to Accounts Payable:\nap@gitlab.com\n.  Most importantly, the team member making the purchase request is ultimately responsible for final review and approval of the invoices. Final review and approval are critical process controls that help ensure we do not make erroneous payments to vendors. All original invoices and payment receipts must be sent to Accounts Payable.\nCreation of Expense Tags\nIf you would like to track spend for a particular campaign, project and/or event you can do that through expense tag, also known as classes in NetSuite.  If you would like to request an expense tag/class to be set up please open\nthis tracker\nand enter the information required for the General Ledger (GL) team to create the tag.\nThe GL team will create the tags at the end of each day.\nThe tag is created in Netsuite and syncs with Navan and Coupa.\nRequisitions can be saved for later, while you complete the tag creation process.\nCreate Classes In NetSuite:\nIn NetSuite go to Setup-Company-Classes-New\nAdd the name of the expense tag under Name\nUnder subsidiaries highlight GitLab Inc and check the box that states ‚ÄúInclude in Children‚Äù\nSave\nNavan will auto-sync any new ‚Äúexpense tags‚Äù on a daily basis, but if the Navan admin wants to manually sync they can do so by following these steps:\nImport new Classes/Tags In Navan:\nGo to the Admin page and click on the\nPolicies\ntab.\nSelect a policy and find the\nConnections\nClick the\nSync Now\nbutton for the NetSuite connector. The page will run a prompt showing sync status.\nOnce the syncing process is complete, go to the\nTags\nsubtab.\nSearch for the tag by name under classifications (i.e. the NetSuite profiles created in prior steps)\nCorporate Credit Cards\nPlease review this\npage\nfor the current policy/procedures.\nContribute Costs and other key expenses\nMarketing Campaign Expenses\nPlease see the\ncampaign expense guidelines in the Marketing handbook\n.\nGitLab Contribute Cost Tracking\n(Previously GitLab Summit)\nTracking expenses for company Contributes enables us to analyze our spend and find opportunities to iterate, and in turn, improve subsequent Contributes. To enable tracking we create an expense tag that will allow GitLab team-members to tag Contribute related expenses in Navan. This should be done prior to the announcement of each Contribute.\nTo categorize an expense under an expense tag to track a specific marketing campaign, contribute expense and/or any special project you will do this under the ‚Äúclassifications‚Äù tag in Navan.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet. Following are the sub-processes:\nAcquisition and Capitalization\nCapital Assets Policy\nPurpose\nThis policy establishes the minimum cost (capitalization amount) used to determine the capital assets recorded in GitLab‚Äôs financial statements.\nCapital Assets Defined\nA ‚ÄúCapital Asset‚Äù is a unit of property that has an economic useful life extending beyond 12 months\nand\nwas acquired (or in some cases, produced) for a cost of\nor more. Capital Assets must be capitalized and depreciated for financial reporting purposes.\nCapitalization Thresholds\nGitLab establishes\nas the minimum amount required for capitalization. Any item with a cost below this amount is expensed on the date of purchase. Exceptions are Key Component Assets (i.e. computer laptops).\nBulk purchases (‚Äúlike‚Äù items acquired with a single purchase order, which are received within a reasonable period of time of one another (less than 60 days) and that individually have an Acquisition Cost less than the Individual Purchases Capitalization Threshold) have a Capitalization Threshold of $50,000 (USD)\nDepreciation/Amortization\nMethodology\nAll capital assets are recorded at historical cost as of the acquisition date. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the number of depreciation periods being determined by asset class.\nComputer and I/T Equipment:\nFor our purposes, Computer and I/T Equipment generally consists of computers (laptops) and are assigned a standard useful life of two (2) years. This depreciation schedule applies to all entities.\nOffice Equipment and Furniture & Fixtures:\nThe standard useful life for Office Equipment and Furniture & Fixtures is five (5) years. This depreciation schedule applies to all entities.\nInvoices and purchase receipts for capital assets are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\nFixed Asset Register and Asset Tracking\nItems paid for by the company are property of the company. Assets with purchasing value in excess of\nor Key Component Assets are recorded and tracked through NetSuite Fixed Asset Management (FAM) module, which includes details of individual asset purchased. The Asset Register report provided by NetSuite FAM provides each individual asset purchased with the following information:\nPeriod and Date of purchase\nAsset Cost\nAsset Category\nAsset Description\nUseful life\nSerial number, if available\nGL Coding\nOnce the information is captured in NetSuite FAM a depreciation schedule will populate and NetSuite FAM will post a journal entry each month to record the depreciation of the asset until it is fully depreciated. The asset will remain on GitLab‚Äôs balance sheet until the asset is no longer being used and is identified to be disposed.\nDisposition of an Asset\nAssets will be disposed of if purchased by an employee upon termination (if approved by IT Ops) or if the item is no longer useful before the useful life.\nIf a team member would like to purchase an asset from the company (i.e. a laptop), they would request through an issue to IT Ops and Accounting to obtain the amount to be paid. This is derived from original cost less accumulated depreciation.  If an asset is purchased, Accounting will collect the funds and will book the appropriate accounting treatment to dispose of the asset.\nIf an asset is no longer usable before the useful life has been reached the employee needs to submit an issue to IT Ops and Accounting to inform them.  IT Ops will evaluate and if they deem the item is no longer useful, Accounting will book the appropriate accounting treatment to dispose of the asset.\nIT Ops will need to identify the asset and inform Accounting to properly dispose of the asset from NetSuite FAM.\nAccounting Policies\nRecord to report process is governed by the following accounting policies:\nGITLAB INC. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY\nRefer to Legal page for\nRelated Party Transactions policy\nAccounting Team PTO Guidelines\nOur ability to accomplish our Finance and Accounting mission of providing timely, fact-based information to drive business results as a public company depends on the participation of team members during certain critical times of year. Our accounting function provides critical, time based deliverables that directly impact our ability to support business growth and meet our public company obligations. These activities require the entire team‚Äôs support.\nTeam Members should prioritize taking time off to refresh and recharge outside of these critical windows. While these exact windows vary by team, generally we need all team members to support the last week of the quarter and first two weeks of the next quarter. Check with your manager if you are unsure what is applicable to your role. When these windows overlap a weekend (particularly the last day of the quarter) or public holiday/ Family and Friends day, we recommend team members work with their manager to reschedule the day off to a day outside of this critical end of quarter time period. If a team member is unavailable to work during this time period, they should provide their manager with at least one months‚Äô notice whenever possible to allow for coverage to be arranged. When appropriate, we will create rotational coverage plans over holidays/weekends, while remaining in line with applicable jurisdictional requirements.\nInvestment Policy\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish the responsibility, authority and guidelines for the investment of operating surplus cash.  Surplus cash is defined as those funds exceeding the operating requirements of the Company and not immediately required for working capital or near term financial obligations.\nScope\nThis policy shall apply to the Company and all subsidiaries.  This investment policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with the overall objectives of the Company and with current financial trends.\nApproved Brokerage Institutions\nThe Company may use the following brokerage institutions:\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC\nComerica Securities, Inc.\nInvestment Objectives\nThe basic objectives of the Company‚Äôs investment program are, in order of priority:\nSafety and preservation of principal by investing in a high quality, diversified portfolio of securities, mutual funds, and bank deposits.\nLiquidity of investments that is sufficient to meet the Company‚Äôs projected cash flow requirements and strategic needs.\nMaximize after-tax market rates of return on invested funds that are consistent with the stated objectives herein, conservative risk tolerance and the Company‚Äôs current tax position.\nMaturity Limits\nIndividual security maturities should not exceed 24 months.  The weighted average maturity of the portfolio shall not exceed 12 months.  A maturity or effective maturity by definition shall include puts, announced calls or other structural features which will allow the Company to redeem the investments at a quantifiable price consistent with liquidity, safety and preservation of capital.\nEligible Investments\nUnited States Government Securities:\nMarketable debt securities which are direct obligations of the U.S.A., issued by or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government and supported by the full faith and credit of the United States.\nUnited States Government Agency Securities:\nDebt securities issued by the Government Sponsored Enterprises, Federal Agencies and certain international institutions which are not direct obligations of the United States, but involve Government sponsorship and are fully guaranteed by government agencies or enterprises, including but not limited to:\nFederal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB)\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)\nFederal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)\nMoney Market funds\nMoney Market Funds must be rated AAA or equivalent by at least one NRSROs.\nAt time of purchase investment restrictions:\nInvestment Products (Rating, Sector Concentration, Issuer Concentration)\nUS Government (AA+, No Sector Concentration, No Issue Concentration)\nAgency (AA+, 50% Sector Concentration, 10% Issuer Concentration)\nMoney Market Funds - US Government/Treasury (AAA, No Sector Concentration, 50% Issuer Concentration)\nPrepaid Expense Policy\nPurpose\nThis policy describes the methodology used to monitor and account for GitLab‚Äôs prepaid expenses.\nEffective 2022-04-01 a new Accounting Prepaid Automation Process has been implemented. Please click\nhere\nto learn more about the process, which utilizes Coupa.\nPrepaid Expenses Defined\nPrepaid Expense\narises when a cash disbursement is made for goods and services prior to realizing the associated benefits of the underlying goods and services. These transactions are recorded as assets until the goods and services are realized, at which point an expense is recorded. Our minimum threshold for recording prepaid expenses is\nIdentification and Recording of Prepaid Expenses\nOnce a purchase request makes it through the\ncompany approval workflow\n, Accounting will take the following steps to ensure prepaid expenses are recorded accurately:\nThe amount involved is\nequal to or exceeds $5,000\n. Prepaid expenses below $5,000 must be recorded as period expense immediately as incurred.\nThe prepayment is for a time period\ngreater than 12 months\n; (period of time is excluded for the Deposit of an event)\nif an amount is equal or greater than $50,000 on a single item in one invoice, it can be capitalized if the prepayment time period spans across fiscal quarters\n.\nAny\ndeposits\nmade for events in Marketing, Corporate or other departments of less than $5,000 USD will be recognized as an expense immediately on the day the invoice is received regardless of whether the event has taken place or not.\nThe $5,000 clip level normally applies per invoice or per item. However, situations may exist that would require exercising business judgement on a case by case basis (i.e. any clip level by total amount of purchase per vendor). Also, there are situations when each individual prepaid may not meet the clip level but as a whole, these prepayments are similar in nature and are purchased in a bulk and therefore, the total amount of all the prepaid should be combined and used to decide if the prepayment should be recorded. Any exceptions should be pre-approved by the Corporate Controller or PAO.\nAmortization is recorded straight line based on a mid-month amortization method as follows:\nIf the first month of service begins on the 1st to the 15th of the month, a full month amortization will be recorded in the current month.  If the first month of service begins on the 16th to the last day of the month, amortization will begin on the 1st day of the subsequent month.\nMid-Month Amortization Method does not apply to prepaid expenses with a monthly amortization equal to or greater than 50,000 USD or if the amortization if spread only over 1 period.  If monthly amortization is equal to or more than 50,000 USD, the first month amortization will be calculated based on actual number of days where services were rendered.\nPrepaid Not Paid:  For any prepaid expenses not processed for payment, an adjustment for ‚Äúprepaid not paid‚Äù is posted to the respective prepaid expense account and AP manual adjustment account (GL Account 2001).  A prepaid expense is not treated as an asset if a liability remains in the AP sub-ledger.  Prepaid not paid adjustments are performed on a quarterly basis at minimum.\nAny deposits paid which will be held for more than 12 months such as security deposits or deposits to retain consultants will be booked to Security & Other Deposits (GL Account 1620)\nPrepaid Bonuses with a Clawback will be recorded to Prepaid Bonus w/Clawback (GL Account 1152) and will be amortized in accordance with the bonus agreement terms, using the mid-month convention.\nFinally, the balance is reviewed one last time when the Senior Accounting Manager performs a review of the financials prior to closing the period.\nContribute related expenses\nTeam member travel expenses are expensed in the period incurred. Costs related to third party vendors such as hotels, facilities, excursions are recorded to prepaid expenses and recognized as expense at the time of the event.\nAccrued Liabilities Policy\nPurpose\nTo provide clear guidance concerning the identification and recording of items included in GitLab‚Äôs accrued and other liability accounts. The purpose of monthly accrual processes is to allocate expenses to the proper accounting period and match expenses with related revenues. At the close of each month, accrual processes ensure that all expenses related to that month are correctly included in the company‚Äôs financial statements. Additionally, this policy establishes standards and guidelines for ensuring that GitLab accounts for monthly accruals in a manner that is compliant with management‚Äôs objectives and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This policy applies to GitLab and all subsidiaries.\nIdentification\nWe require that all expenses be recorded where expense exceeds $5K USD or above, in the period the expense was incurred. The accrual process should be completed on a monthly/quarterly basis to ensure liabilities are recorded accurately in their respective periods and/or quarters. In order to meet industry standards for Month-End close deadlines the Finance and Operations teams are responsible to provide on Working Day -1 (ex. Friday July 30th = WD -1, Monday August 2nd = WD 1) the calculations, information, details and backup needed to support the accruals.\nThe following items should be accrued monthly as necessary (note: this list is not all-inclusive):\nAccounts Payable:\nContracts: Amounts due under contracts, including retainer fees. These items should be recorded as they become billable.\nProfessional Fees: This liability includes legal, tax, and audit consulting and other professional fees.\nLegal Contingencies: Pending or threatened litigation, and actual or probable settlement. Legal contingencies should be determined with the help of GitLab‚Äôs VP of Legal - Commercial, IP & Compliance.\nWages and Compensation:\nTeam Wages: This includes employee wages and independent contractor fees.\nCommissions: Liabilities arising from commission obligations to team members who are eligible for commission compensation.\nBonuses: Liabilities related to bonus payments for GitLab team-members.\nTaxes: All employment taxes required for statutory compliance that relate to the GitLab team.\nAny other material obligation not mentioned above that is a liability of GitLab\nTiming\nObligations that accrue over time are recorded throughout the accounting period in a methodical and rational manner. Obligations that accrue when an event occurs should be recorded at the time of the event.\nFactors that are considered in determining the time of recording accrued liabilities include:\nRisks of ownership passed to GitLab through receipt of goods or services.\nThe expense must have been incurred during the month being closed; that is, the product or service must have been received on or before the last day of the month in order to qualify as an expense.\nEven though an expense may have been initially budgeted in the month, it is not eligible for accrual unless the company received the product or service.\nAccruals are reversed in the next month and re-accrued the following month, as needed.\nIf payment is due prior to receiving goods or services, the amount should be accrued to prepaid expenses.\nProcedural\nThe Finance team is responsible for having procedures in place to reconcile accounts monthly and for keeping documentation to support accrued liabilities. Payables and accrued liabilities are recorded at face value, plus or minus any applicable adjustments. In most cases, the payable amount can be determined from the vendor bill. If not, then the amount should be verified against any relevant documents before recording the liability. When actual values are not available, the recorded value should be based on best available estimates. Estimates should be based on current market price and experience/history.\nLegal Professional Fees:  Monthly templates are e-mailed by the 1st to all legal firms requesting them to complete with all outstanding bills and unbilled services as of that month end (ex. e-mails are sent by April 1st requesting services as of March 31st).  The responses from all legal firms are complied and reviewed with the VP of Legal - Commercial, IP & Compliance by the 5th, and accruals are made based on the responses and review.  In addition, any potential legal contingencies are discussed during the monthly meeting with the VP of Legal and an accrual is recorded if the loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nTax and Audit Professional Fees:  Similarly e-mails with the template are sent to the tax and audit firms and the tax responses are compiled and reviewed with the Director of Tax and the audit firm responses are reviewed with the Accounting and External Reporting Manager by the 5th and appropriate accruals are made based on the review.\nThe Sr. Accounting Manager is responsible for performing an overall review of accrued liabilities, one to three business days after accounts payable closes each month, to help ensure that all expenses are captured accurately.\nPlease see\nProcure-to-Pay\nForeign Currency Translation Policy\nOverview\nForeign currency translation describes the method used in converting a foreign entity‚Äôs functional currency (as determined and documented in GitLab.com>Finance>Issues>#630) to the reporting entity‚Äôs financial statement currency. Prior to translating the foreign entity‚Äôs financial statements into the reporting entity‚Äôs currency, the foreign entity‚Äôs financials must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), specifically under\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.52\n. GitLab‚Äôs financial statement reporting currency is USD. The functional currency of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Changes in foreign currency translation are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the consolidated statement of equity and ultimately carried over to the consolidated balance sheet, under equity.\nExchange Rates\nExchange rates used in the currency translation process vary across the three primary financial statement components:\nAssets and Liabilities:\nExchange rate between functional currency and reporting currency at period-end.\nIncome Statement:\nThe average exchange rates during the period presented.\nEquity:\nThe historical exchange rate at the date when entry is made to shareholder‚Äôs equity. Changes in retained earnings are based on historical exchange rates of each period‚Äôs income statement.\nTransaction Risk vs Translation Risk\nCurrency Transaction Risk\nCurrency transaction risk is due to company transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions must be restated into the entity functional currency equivalents before they can be recorded. Gains(losses) are recognized when a payment is made or interim balance sheet dates.\nCurrency Translation Risk\nCurrency translation risk occurs due to the company owning assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.\nCumulative Translation Adjustment\nA cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) is an entry to the comprehensive income section of a translated balance sheet that summarizes the gains(losses) resulting from exchange rate differences over time. Currency values shift constantly, affecting how a currency is valued against others. The CTA is a line item in the consolidated balance sheet that captures gains(losses) associated with international business activity and exposure to foreign markets. The changes in CTA are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). CTA‚Äôs are required under GAAP since they help distinguish between actual operating gains(losses) and those that arise from the currency translation process. Additional information on our reporting standards surrounding CTA‚Äôs can be found in\nFASB Topic 830, ‚ÄúForeign Currency Matters.‚Äù\nRecording CTA - Exchange rate gains and losses for individual transactions are captured automatically by our ERP system, NetSuite. However, a CTA entry must be made in order to properly distinguish currency translation gains(losses) from other general gains(losses) in the consolidated financial statements. This entry includes reconciliation of any inter-company activity that generates foreign exchange gains(losses). The CTA is made on a monthly basis as part of our financial statement reporting cycle.\nChart of Accounts Policy\nScope\nThis policy establishes GitLab‚Äôs guidelines regarding the structure, responsibilities and requirements underlying the\nchart of accounts (COA).\nPurpose\nThis policy establishes formal responsibilities and accountabilities for how GitLab handles requests for new, modified or closed data elements on the COA. The Controller is responsible for all aspects of financial accounting and reporting, and governs the COA.  All requests for new or modified (including closure/deactivation) COA segments, hierarchies, and configuration attributes are subject to approval by the Finance team.\nChanges to the COA\nAll requests for new or modified accounts must be submitted to the Accounting Manager for review and approval through a request using the Finance issue tracker.\nThere are other stakeholders associated with the COA that may influence certain business decisions or financial system configurations. The Controller and Accounting Manager will include selected stakeholders in the related procedures and processes when and if appropriate. Potential stakeholders include, but may not be limited to:\nFinancial Planning and Analysis\nData & Analytics\nOther departments who have shared functionalities within the financial system\nThe general ledger attributes subject to this policy will be defined by the Controller based upon factors including but not limited to:\nCreating and maintaining consistency for the structure of accounts\nStandard accounting policies and practices\nRegulatory compliance requirements and reporting needs\nFinancial and operational reporting needs and requirements\nExternal accounting and financial reporting requirements\nOnce an amendment to the COA has been approved, the Accounting Manager will ensure the necessary changes are implemented by updating and then closing the issue.\nAdministration\nThe COA is maintained in NetSuite. Changes to the COA can only be made by the Controller and/or Accounting Manager.\nAccount Reconciliation Policy\nScope\nThis policy applies to GitLab Inc. (‚ÄúGitLab‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) and all of its subsidiaries.\nPurpose\nTo establish guidelines for assessing, preparing and reviewing balance sheet account reconciliations on a consistent basis in accordance with corporate policies and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‚ÄúGAAP‚Äù).\nPolicy\nAccount reconciliations are prepared and reviewed monthly or quarterly for each active balance sheet account at the natural account level based upon the risk rating assessed (see risk rating assessment below).  Account reconciliations will be prepared consolidated in USD or by entity in the respective functional currency.\nEach month end close the Accounting Manager assigns each balance sheet account or groups of accounts to its respective preparer and reviewer using FloQast (Account Reconciliation Tool).  The assignments are set once and will roll over into the next accounting period.  The Accounting Manager will make changes to assignments as needed.  The preparer and reviewers can not be the same person to ensure segregation of duties.\nThe balances from NetSuite will be auto synced into FloQast each period end so the preparers can prepare their recons based on the NetSuite ending balance for their respective assigned accounts.\nThe preparer(s) will ensure the following:\nReview all activities ensure activity is recorded properly.\nIdentify any reconciling items.\nUpload any supporting documentation and/or add schedules as needed.\nSign-off the recon in FloQast.\nThe reviewer(s) will ensure the following:\nEnsures account reconciliations are prepared in compliance with this policy.\nEnsures the account reconciliations are complete, accurate and appropriate.\nSign-off the account reconciliation in FloQast which will update the status of the recon to the reviewed/approved status.\nFloQast will auto sign-off the recon on our behalf if the following is met:\nBalance is zero\nIf the balance changes after review, approval or auto sign-off the recon will be automatically unreconciled by FloQast and the preparer and reviewers will need to follow the above steps again.\nRisk Rating Assessment\nOnce a year in the beginning of Q4, the Controller and/or CFO will review each active balance sheet account and rate it from High, Medium and Low.  The risk level of each account is evaluated based both on the quantitative value (to determine materiality) and the qualitative factors listed below:\nLevel of judgement required:  risk increases as level of judgement required increases\nroutine/non-routine transactions: risk increases as amount of non-routine/non-standard processes required to record the activity increases\nHistory of issues: risk increases as the number of audit-related adjustments, questions, restatements increases.\nComplexity: risk increases due to business/system changes, new pronouncements, and new complex calculations that impact the balance sheet.\nHigh Risk Accounts will be reconciled by the preparer monthly (for the exception of tax and equity related accounts which will be reconciled quarterly) and will require 1st level review by an accounting manager or above and 2nd level review by the CFO or PAO.\nMedium Risk Accounts will be reconciled by the preparer monthly and will require 1st level review by an accounting manager or above.\nLow Risk Accounts will be reconciled by the preparer monthly or quarterly and will require 1st level review by an accounting manager or above.\nIf there is no activity and/or the account balance is zero the reconciliation will be auto certified by BlackLine.\nOnce each reconciliation is reviewed/approved the account reconciliation is locked in BlackLine and no further changes can be made for that period.\nCompleteness Check\nOnce the period is officially closed the Senior Accounting Manager will ensure all recons are in approved, reviewed or in a auto-certified status before moving into the next period.\nFinancial Operations\nLast modified February 7, 2025:\nReplace ref links with regular links (\n9fe84978\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 10024}

Follow the steps outlined in the\nRequesting Support with Customer ESG Questions\nsection below\nSustainability Programs\nCorporate Sustainability\nis a business approach that enhances long term stakeholder value by implementing a strategy that considers every dimension of how a business operates when making social, environmental and economic progress.\nstands for Environmental, Social and Governance and refers to the three key factors when measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment in a business or company.\nAt GitLab we use Sustainability and ESG interchangeably. Both terms are relevant to our work and both serve different purposes depending on the audience we interact with.\nTeam Overview & Vision\nThe Sustainability\nTeam\ncreates and maintains GitLab‚Äôs Corporate Sustainability strategy and programs by driving and integrating responsible business practices and ESG regulatory compliance.\nThe Sustainability team builds and maintains strong internal and external relationships to understand stakeholder expectations - including customer, investor and team members. This engagement allows us to remain customer centric and easy to do business with while meeting shareholder and team member expectations.\nThe Sustainability Team has two primary functions and four corresponding programs:\nCompliance, Reporting & Climate Action\nCompliance & Reporting\n: Manages customer and prospect ESG-related questionnaires, requests for proposals, and sustainability contractual clauses. Leads annual Sustainability report and external assurance process. Monitors global ESG regulation and works cross-functionally to advance GitLab‚Äôs culture of compliance with applicable ESG regulations. Responds to investor ESG rating agencies to maintain competitive ESG scoring among peers.\nClimate Action\n: Identifies and executes strategic climate programs, including annual measurement of GitLab‚Äôs greenhouse gas inventory, emissions reduction target-setting, partners with Procurement to run the sustainable supplier program, identifies emissions reduction opportunities across the business, and purchases high quality carbon credits. Manages team member & customer communications related to GitLab‚Äôs commitment to environmental sustainability.\nSocial Impact\nGiveLab\n: GiveLab is GitLab‚Äôs team member volunteer program and includes year-round volunteering, GiveLab 30 days of Impact, our annual company-wide volunteer campaign and GiveLab Champions Program. Volunteerism is an effective way to build trust through social connections - this leads to higher individual and team motivation, and greater cross-functional collaboration.\nGitLab for Non-Profits\n: GitLab‚Äôs in-kind donation program. Manages social impact communications with team members and customers, while developing strategic nonprofit partnerships to advance GitLab‚Äôs ESG goals and help enhance our brand reputation by demonstrating our commitment to the nonprofit community.\nSustainability Strategy\nDeeply integrated into our business philosophy, GitLab‚Äôs Sustainability strategy is driven by our\nvalues\nof Collaboration, Results for Customers, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency (CREDIT). GitLab‚Äôs stakeholders, including customers, investors, team members, and community members play a key role in GitLab‚Äôs Sustainability strategy.\nGitLab conducted its inaugural ESG materiality assessment in 2022. By conducting a materiality assessment with our stakeholders, we identified which ESG topics have the greatest impact on GitLab‚Äôs business and where we have the potential to have the greatest impact on the environment, society, and our global communities - those material topics drive the programs, policies and initiatives under our strategy.\nThis page will continue to be updated as we make progress towards developing plans and programs to advance our Sustainability goals.\nSustainability Advisory Committee\nThe purpose of the advisory committee is to create cross-functional alignment on ESG objectives and decision making, to go beyond simply compliance and into long-term operational implementation.\nMembers of the Sustainability Advisory Committee\nRobin Schulman (Egroup)\nRob Allen (Egroup)\nBrian Robins (Egroup)\nStacy Cline (ESG)\nKim Buncle (ESG)\nKelsey Turcotte (Investor Relations)\nLisa Boughner (Communications)\nAmie Bright (Marketing)\nBilly Stallings (Marketing)\nSherida McMullan (DIB)\nStella Treas (CoS)\nScott Rissmiller (Corporate Legal)\nEmily Plotkin (Employment Legal)\nRendi Miller (Procurement)\nJames Shen (Finance)\nMarin Jankovski (Infrastructure)\nTaylor McCaslin (Product)\nCompliance & Reporting\nLike all functions at GitLab, transparency is a core focus. Every year GitLab publishes an annual ESG report where we share our approach to managing our key ESG focus areas, provide updates on programs and policies, achievements to date, metrics and targets, and plans for the future.\nFY23 ESG Report\nFY24 ESG Report\nThe Sustainability team works cross-functionally to prepare GitLab for compliance with ESG regulations.\nThe Sustainability team also supports internal teams with customer ESG questionnaires and RFPs. Customers and prospective customers are increasingly asking about GitLab‚Äôs Sustainability programs, including questions related to GitLab‚Äôs climate commitments and greenhouse gas emissions. Many of our customers are also subject to ESG regulation and we expect customer ESG questions to continue to increase as they look to better align to new regulations.\nRequesting Support with Customer ESG Questions\nIf a customer or potential customer has questions related to GitLab‚Äôs ESG practices\nas part of an RFP\n, please follow the\nRFP process\nIf a customer or potential customer requests information via an ESG questionnaire, please open an issue\nhere\nand select the ‚ÄòESG Questionnaire‚Äô template\nIf there‚Äôs an opportunity to connect the Sustainability team directly, please reach out in the\n#sustainability-esg\nSlack channel\nClimate Action\nGitLab is committed to doing our part to minimize our environmental footprint, including working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operations. GitLab‚Äôs stakeholders, including customers, investors, regulators, and team members expect the company to operate sustainably and to do our part to reduce our environmental footprint.\nMany of GitLab‚Äôs customers have GHG reduction targets and as a vendor, GitLab‚Äôs carbon emissions contribute to our customers‚Äô emissions footprints. To remain easy to transact with, GitLab needs to meet the expectations of our customers by taking action on climate change.\nGitLab‚Äôs Climate Action Program consists of four pillars:\nMeasure & Report:\nEvery year GitLab conducts an annual greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory in alignment with the GHG Protocol, the global best practice carbon accounting standard. We publish the results of the inventory in our annual ESG report and have the data assured by a third-party. In 2026, GitLab is subject to new regulations in the US and the EU that will make these disclosures mandatory.\nAct:\nGitLab is taking action to reduce our carbon emissions. As a fully remote software company, the majority of our emissions come from our suppliers. Engaging our suppliers to measure their carbon emissions and set their own reduction targets is a critical component of our reduction pathway, which is why we have set an aspirational supplier engagement target. Please see the\nSustainable Procurement Program\nfor more information. The Sustainability team continues to explore other ways to reduce emissions and is doing further analysis on additional reduction pathways.\nEngage:\nThis includes engaging GitLab team members in climate education and action. In 2024, we launched the\nGitLab Team Member Sustainability Guide\n, providing actionable steps team members can take at home to minimize their environmental impact. In FY26, we launched our partnership with\nMammoth Climate\n, a climate literacy and challenges platform, to further engage team members with educational materials, activities, and rewards\nAccelerate:\nWhile GitLab works to reduce our emissions, we are also committed to accelerating climate solutions by purchasing high quality carbon credits to cover a portion of our carbon footprint. We are proud to partner with\nRubicon Carbon\nto purchase a diversified portfolio of high quality carbon credits, financing carbon removal projects that meet Rubicon‚Äôs\nhigh standards of quality\n.\nSustainable Procurement Program\nIn FY25, GitLab set an aspirational science-aligned supplier engagement target to reduce our Scope 3 emissions: 70% of our suppliers (by emissions) will have science-aligned climate targets by FY29.\nOur sustainable procurement program includes the following initiatives:\nAnnual emissions survey to request data from suppliers in an effort to improve the accuracy of our footprint\nUse strategic business reviews to understand key barriers suppliers face when measuring and reporting their emissions\nProvide resources and training to suppliers on how to measure and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions\nProvide resources and training to team members responsible for supplier selection on our new expectations of suppliers, aligned with applicable laws.\nWe look forward to sharing updates on this new initiative.\nGiveLab\nAt GitLab, all team members do work that supports the company, which supports the enhancement of an open source codebase. This codebase is freely available to everyone to make better software faster and drive progress through what they build. Between 2022 and 2024, team members made over 125,000 commits to the open source part of the GitLab codebase.\nBut, there are also other ways to give back and many team members choose to contribute beyond GitLab. In addition to contributing to GitLab, GitLab offers additional optional pathways for team members to give back while leveraging their unique skills and passions through programs such as GiveLab, GitLab‚Äôs Team Member Volunteer Program.\nGitLab encourages team members to take part in volunteer initiatives such as supporting their local communities, participating in virtual volunteer activities, and organizing volunteer activities as part of team events. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for\nboosting engagement\n, improving employee retention, and\nstrengthening relationships at work\n. Volunteering with GiveLab supports team members in fostering connections, building trust among one another and embodying our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities.\nTeam members may self organize volunteer events at any point throughout the year. To submit a request for a team volunteer activity with a\nRegistered Nonprofit Organization\nthat isn‚Äôt on the current\nGiveLab Nonprofit Directory\n, please go to the\nPhilanthropic Requests epic\nand open a new issue using the\nVolunteer_Support Template\n.\nTeam members can also request support from the Sustainability Team to organize local or virtual volunteer opportunities on their behalf by going to the\nPhilanthropic Requests epic\nand opening a new issue using the\nVolunteer_Support Template\n. Please write ‚Äúyes‚Äù for the question, ‚ÄúWould you like the Sustainability team‚Äôs help organizing the volunteer activity?‚Äù\nAll team members and volunteer activities must adhere to the\nGitLab Philanthropy Policy\n. Team members must follow GitLab‚Äôs paid time off (PTO) policy if volunteering during work hours and use the ‚Äúpublic service/volunteer‚Äù option in Workday.\nIf volunteering in person, team members may incur some expenses. For calendar year 2024, team members can expense up to a total of $25 for expenses incurred that meet the allowed for reimbursement criteria. All expenses should be submitted in Navan using the ‚ÄúGiveLab‚Äù classification. Please note that GitLab does not allow team members to travel to in-person volunteer events. All in-person volunteering should be local to the team member.\nAs with all\ncompany expenses\n, team members must be thoughtful in spending the company‚Äôs money and use best judgment to ensure that all expenses are deemed ‚Äúordinary and necessary.‚Äù Team members should follow all\nteam member expense responsibilities\n.\nExpenses allowed for reimbursement (for in-person volunteer events):\nLocal travel only -\nmileage\n,\ntrain\n,\ntaxi/rideshares\n.

To review previous opportunities that team members participated in, visit the\nhistorical activities page\n.\nGiveLab 30 Days of Impact\nGiveLab 30 Days of Impact is GitLab‚Äôs annual volunteer campaign created to encourage team members to foster connections, build trust among one another and embody our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities. We have designed this program with our high-performing team culture and results for customers in mind.\nGiveLab 30 days of Impact runs annually in Q4 and our goal is to encourage as many team members as possible to volunteer over the course of 30 days.\nThroughout the month, team members can volunteer as little as one hour of their time to make an impact. We understand that our team members are driven by many different factors, and we welcome that volunteer participation will look different for everyone. Through GiveLab 30 days of Impact we aim to offer many different ways for team members to get involved such as:\nThrough company-sponsored virtual events\nLocal in-person volunteer events organized by the GitLab Sustainability team,\nGiveLab Champions\n, and team members\nIndividual volunteer pursuits\nFind and contribute to opportunities in the\nGiveLab Volunteer Directory\nInclude a volunteer activity at an all-hands or team builder\nContribute to\nGitLab‚Äôs codebase\nAssist with\nretention\nand recruitment efforts\nWhy GiveLab 30 Days of Impact Exists\nWhile GitLab encourages year-round volunteerism through\nGiveLab\n, GiveLab 30 days of Impact centralizes our efforts into an annual campaign to have a larger collective impact over a specific timeframe. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for\nboosting engagement\n, improving employee retention, and\nstrengthening relationships at work\n. Additionally, this program offers volunteering opportunities around a major holiday season in many parts of the world, a time when many are seeking opportunities to give back.\nTeam Member Benefits of Volunteerism\nDevelop new skills and knowledge\nExpand your professional network and connections\nUnderstand the nonprofit community‚Äôs needs and how your skills can help\nMake a meaningful difference in your community\nImportance of Volunteerism at GitLab\nProvide an additional option for team members to volunteer and make a positive impact beyond the impact team members make every day by contributing to GitLab - the platform and the company\nProvide another way for team members to embody our CREDIT values through volunteerism and social impact\nExpand GitLab‚Äôs positive impact across communities\nBuild trust amongst team members through social connections\nBoost team member engagement\nUtilizing GitLab‚Äôs PTO Policy to Volunteer\nTeam member participation is voluntary, should not interfere with work commitments, and time off is required to be in alignment with GitLab‚Äôs\nPTO policy\n. Travel is not permitted for this program. Team Members may choose to volunteer virtually or through local in-person events. Volunteer events typically last between one and four hours. Managers play an important role in supporting team members in taking time for themselves and their families, while also ensuring accountability to results and coverage for teams and its goals. Our Results for Customers value sits at the top of our values hierarchy, and our PTO policy empowers managers to appropriately manage workloads and deliverables, while also giving team members the time away they need from work.\nHow to Request Volunteer Time Off\nTeam Members taking time off to volunteer should communicate time off in advance with their manager. To request volunteer time off, follow the\nPaid Time Off\nprocedures outlined in our handbook and reach out to People Connect via HelpLab should you have any concerns.

A ‚ÄúRegistered Nonprofit Organization‚Äù is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal or national government.\nFor the calendar year 2024, we will limit the in-kind program to 5,000 seats, which was approved by finance and the board in the\nPhilanthropy Policy\n. Each organization will be eligible for up to 20 seats. This will allow us to assist as many organizations as possible. This will be revisited throughout the year and adjusted as needed. Interested organizations who are new customers may request additional seats although the request may not be granted. To limit churn, current GitLab customers that apply to transition to the Nonprofit Program will not be granted a special request above the 20 seats.\nWhat are the terms of the GitLab for Nonprofits program?\nUpon acceptance, program members are subject to the\nGitLab Subscription Agreement\n. The decision to issue a GitLab for Nonprofits license is always at the sole discretion of GitLab.\nHow does someone apply?\nInterested organizations need to visit the\nGitLab for Nonprofits\npage and submit the\napplication form\n.\nHow are applications processed?\nNonprofits apply on the\nGitLab for Nonprofits\npage. Once the application is submitted, the Nonprofit will receive a message and a link to TechSoup, our verification partner.\nThe Nonprofit will then need to log in or create their TechSoup account. TechSoup provides a rigorous vetting process to ensure the nonprofit is eligible for the GitLab for Nonprofits program and meets all requirements.\nIf a Nonprofit is verified, TechSoup will notify GitLab.\nGitLab will then undergo its own vetting and approval process.\nOnce all parties have verified and approved the Nonprofit, GitLab will send the instructions directly to the Nonprofit to redeem their license.\nIf a Nonprofit is not verified through TechSoup, TechSoup will provide details on how the Nonprofit can become verified.\nIf a Nonprofit is declined from GitLab, GitLab will notify the Nonprofit via\nnonprofits@GitLab.com\n.\nPlease allow up to 15 business days for the application and verification process.\nMust Nonprofits renew their memberships?\nYes. All nonprofits must renew their membership annually, which involves a re-verification process. Nonprofits will submit for renewal the same way they first applied for the program.\nWhere can members receive support?\nWhile GitLab for Nonprofits Program benefits do not include product\nsupport\n, program members can receive help with GitLab in a number of ways. In general, we recommend the following:\nSend questions or issues requiring immediate attention or sensitive information to the GitLab for Nonprofits team at\nNonprofits@GitLab.com\nReview\nGitLab Docs\nfor answers to general product-related questions\nPost questions in the\nGitLab Forum\n, where community members and GitLab team members can review and discuss them\nFile bug reports and breaking behaviors\nas issues\nfor product teams to review and address\nI‚Äôm a GitLab Team Member and I have a customer applying for the program. What do I do?\nPlease point the Nonprofit to the GitLab for Nonprofits page to learn about the program, eligibility and application\nIf the Nonprofit has questions on the eligibility or status of an application, please advise them to reach out to\nnonprofits@gitlab.com\n. Or team members can inquire about the status of an application in\n#esg\nIf you have a question or concern about the customer churn, please raise this in #gitlab-for-nonprofits slack channel and a Sustainability team member will contact you\nPhilanthropic Requests\nInformation on how GitLab Inc. supports Registered Nonprofit Organizations can be found in the\nPhilanthropy Policy\n.\nPlease note that for all Philanthropic Requests, including requests for GitLab to join as a member to an association, program or organization, approval by the Sustainability team and CLO is required as defined by the Oversight Responsibility section of the Policy.\nIf you would like to submit a philanthropic request, please follow the instructions based on your request type.\nMonetary Contributions\nThere are two ways that team members can submit a request for monetary support:\nRequest funding from the Sustainability team to support a Registered Nonprofit Organization OR (not currently accepting applications - see instructions below on submitting a non-profit for future consideration)\nRequest utilizing department or TMRG budget to support a Registered Nonprofit Organization\nIf you are requesting funding from the Sustainability team to support a Registered Nonprofit Organization, please note that at this time, we are not accepting applications. If you would like to submit a Nonprofit Organization to be considered for support in the future, please go to the\nPhilanthropic Requests epic\nand open a new issue using the\nMonetary_Support Template\n. You will be notified if there is a future opportunity.\nIf you have a department or TMRG budget that you would like to utilize to support a Registered Nonprofit Organization, please go to the\nPhilanthropic Requests epic\nand open a new issue using the\nMonetary_Support Template\n. Please tag your manager to approve the request if you are submitting on behalf of your department. If you are submitting a request on behalf of a TMRG or DIB, please add the DIB DRI as a reviewer.

{"doc_id": "054b06ee3a1f148f", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/about/handbook-usage", "title": "GitLab Handbook Usage | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nAbout the Handbook\nGitLab Handbook Usage\nAbout how GitLab uses the handbook.\nFlow structure\nA (process) problem comes up, frequently in an issue or chat.\nA proposal is made in a merge request to the handbook.\nOnce merged, the change is announced by linking to the diff in the MR or commit. Major ones are posted in the #whats-happening-at-gitlab slack channel. Medium ones are posted in the #handbook channel for visibility, with a one line summary of the change. If there was an issue, close it out with a link to the diff.\nSometimes you want to have real time editing of a proposal during a meeting and you need to use a Google Doc for that. When doing so the first item should be the URL of the handbook page this content will be moved to when the meeting is over.\nWhy handbook first\nDocumenting in the handbook before taking an action may require more time initially because you have to think about where to make the change, integrate it with the existing content, and then possibly add to or refactor the handbook to have a proper foundation. But, it saves time in the long run, and this communication is essential to our ability to continue scaling and adapting our organization.\nThis process is not unlike writing tests for your software. Only communicate a (proposed) change through a change to the handbook; don‚Äôt use a presentation, email, chat message, or another medium to communicate the components of the change. These other forms of communication might be more convenient for the presenter, but they make it harder for the audience to understand the context and the implications for other potentially affected processes.\nHaving a\n‚Äúhandbook first‚Äù\nmentality ensures there is no duplication; the handbook is always up to date, and others are better able to contribute.\nBeyond being ‚Äúhandbook first,‚Äù we are also ‚Äúpublic handbook first.‚Äù When information is\ninternal-only\n, it should be captured in the internal handbook, but we default to the public handbook for anything that can be\nmade public\n. This ensures that everyone has access to any information that can be\nSAFEly\nshared. This supports the GitLab\nvalues\n, including transparency, efficiency, and results. It also protects against the internal handbook becoming a home for information that should otherwise be public or a conflicting or duplicative source of truth.\nWhen asked during an\ncase study interview (shown above) about challenges related to being all-remote, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij provided the following reply.\nThe biggest problem is GitLab not working handbook first. We have an amazing handbook that allows us to collaborate, onboard new people, and think collectively.\nHowever, it is counterintuitive to communicate changes to the handbook. The default of people, when they wish to communicate a change, is to send a Slack message, send an email, give a presentation, or tell people in a meeting ‚Äî\nanything\nbut make a change in the handbook.\nIt‚Äôs slower for them. It‚Äôs quicker to use any other form. If they make a change in the handbook, they first have to find the relevant part of the handbook, they sometimes have to adjust the handbook to make sure their change will fit in, they have to go through a technical process and a review or two, and they have to wait a bit before it‚Äôs deployed.\nIt‚Äôs slower than any other option. However, it allows people that commit a change after that to build upon a change. When they take that extra time, it‚Äôs building a foundation for the next thing.\nI think of it as brick laying. Every piece of information is a brick. At GitLab, there is a well-structured house, and everyone adds to that one house. Because we‚Äôre pretty particular on how we build it, it has a strong foundation and we can build it very high.\nIn every other company, they send the brick into the hands of people. Everyone is receiving bricks daily that they have to add to the house they‚Äôre building internally. They forget things and things are unclear. A lot of context has to be created because there is no context around where to place the bricks.\nSo, you can end up with a thousand houses that look quite different, that are all hanging a bit, and each time you add a brick to the top one pops out at the bottom. ‚Äî\nGitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij\nScope of this handbook\nThe handbook is focused on any content that GitLab team members need to do their job. For other content that might be useful, link to the other source.\nAll documentation that also applies to code contributions from the wider community should be in the GitLab project (for example in\nContributing\nor the\ncode review guidelines\n), not the Handbook, which is only for team members.\nFor user facing company information, there‚Äôs the main marketing\nwebsite\n, and the\nblog\n.\nThe handbook is for things concerning current and future GitLab team-members only. If something concerns users of GitLab, it should be documented in the\nGitLab documentation\n, the\nGitLab Development Kit (GDK)\n, the\nCONTRIBUTING file\nor the\nPROCESS file\n.\nHandbook guidelines\nPlease follow these guidelines and remind others of them.\nHow we use the guide every day\nMost guidelines in this handbook are meant to help, and unless otherwise stated, are meant to help more than being absolute rules. Don‚Äôt be afraid to do something because you don‚Äôt know the entire handbook, nobody does. Be gentle when reminding people about these guidelines. For example say, ‚ÄúIt is not a problem, but next time please consider the following guideline from the handbook.‚Äù\nIf you ask a question and someone answers with a link to the handbook, they do this because they want to help by providing more information. They may also be proud that we have the answer documented. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you should have read the entire handbook, nobody knows the entire handbook.\nIf you need to ask a team member for help, please realize that there is a good chance the majority of the community also doesn‚Äôt know the answer. Be sure to\ndocument\nthe answer to radiate this information to the whole community. After the question is answered, discuss where it should be documented and who will do it. You can remind other people of this request by asking ‚ÄúWho will document this?‚Äù\nWhen you discuss something in chat always try to\nlink\nto a URL where relevant. For example, the documentation you have a question about or the page that answered your question. You can remind other people of this by asking ‚ÄúCan you please link?‚Äù\nRemember, the handbook is not what we hope to do, what we should formally do, or what we did months ago.\nIt is what we do right now.\nMake sure you change the handbook in order to truly change a process. To propose a change to a process, make a merge request to change the handbook. Don‚Äôt use another channel to propose a handbook change (email, Google Doc, etc.).\nThe handbook is the process. Any sections with names like ‚Äòprocess‚Äô, ‚Äòpolicies‚Äô, ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô, or ‚Äòstandard operating procedures‚Äô are an indication of a deeper problem. This may indicate a duplication between a prose description of a process and a numbered list description of the same process that should be combined in one description of the process.\nWhen communicating something always include a link to the relevant (and up-to-date) part of the\nhandbook\ninstead of including the text in the email/chat/etc. You can remind other people of this by asking ‚ÄúCan you please link to the relevant part of the handbook?‚Äù\nEveryone can join the\n#handbook\nchannel to stay up-to-date with changes to the handbook.\nScreenshot the handbook instead of creating a presentation\nPresentations are great for ephemeral content like board presentations.\nEvergreen content\nlike a\nleadership training\nshould be based on the handbook. This is an important element of\nworking handbook-first\n.\nIn the creation of presentations for evergreen content, please screenshot the handbook and provide links to displayed pages rather than copy and pasting content (or formatting a slide specifically to mirror handbook information). This approach shows a\nbias towards asynchronous communication\n, and rationale for this is below.\nIt saves you the effort of needing to both update the handbook and create content for a presentation; the handbook is checked and improved as part of the preparation instead of extra work\nThe handbook will stay up to date so people don‚Äôt look at an outdated information in a presentation\nSeeing screenshots will confirm to people the content is in the handbook and it is up to date there\nPeople get used to the structure of the handbook and can more easily find the relevant handbook section later on\nThe content is open for everyone to contribute to when it is in the handbook\nThe content is integrated with the rest of our processes and shown in context\nMany more people will consume the content on a webpage than a presentation because it is easier to search and link\nYou‚Äôre helping other organizations and students around the work by giving them an example how we do it\nAlso see some of the\nadvantages of using our handbook\nThe presentation will look less polished, but the advantages outweigh that concern.\nIf a synchronous presentation is required, default to sharing your screen and viewing live handbook pages over a slide presentation.\nSearching the Handbook\nEvery GitLab Handbook page has a search field near the top of the page for searching.\nSee the\nSearching GitLab like a pro\npage for tips on searching the handbook faster and more efficiently.\nHow to change or define a process\nTo change a guideline or process,\nsuggest an edit\nin the form of a merge request.\nWhen working to get your change merged quickly, make sure you are asking the appropriate team members with merge rights. Not sure who is responsible? Consult (and add to) the\nfile in the relevant project.\nFor example, CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) Staff members can approve any merge request that is specific to their function, while the CMO approves any merge request that is cross-functional marketing. Chief of Staff to the CEO/CEO approves any merge request that has cross-company impact, such as GitLab‚Äôs\nValues\npage.\nAfter it is merged you can post this in the\n#whats-happening-at-gitlab\nslack channel if applicable. You can remind other people of this by asking ‚ÄúCan you please send a merge request for the handbook?‚Äù\nWhen substantially changing handbook layout, please leave a link to the specific page of the review app\nthat is directly affected by this MR\n. Along with the link, include as much info as possible in the MR description. This will allow everyone to understand what is the purpose of the MR without looking at diffs.\nKeeping up with changes to the Handbook can be difficult, please follow the\ncommit subject guidelines\nwith a particular focus on your merge request‚Äôs title, to ensure someone can quickly understand the MR‚Äôs content.\nCommunicate process changes by linking to the\nmerged diff\n(a commit that shows the changes before and after). If you are communicating a change for the purpose of discussion and feedback, it is ok to link to an\nunmerged diff\n. Do not change the process first, and then view the documentation as a lower priority task. Planning to do the documentation later inevitably leads to duplicate work communicating the change and it leads to outdated documentation. You can remind other people of this by asking ‚ÄúCan you please update the handbook first?‚Äù\nWhen feasible, introduce process changes iteratively. It is important that you contribute to the handbook by\nmaking small merge requests\n. This will help gain adoption among the process‚Äôs intended audience. We want to avoid significant process changes that are unnecessarily large, top-down, and disruptive. These types of process changes can disempower\nDRIs\nand cause people to focus on process rather than results.\nLike everything else, our processes are always in flux. Everything is always in draft, and the initial version should be in the handbook, too. If you are proposing a change to the handbook, whenever possible,\nskip the issue and submit a merge request\n. (Proposing a change in a merge request is preferred over an issue description). Mention the people that are affected by the change in the merge request. In many cases, merge requests are easier to collaborate on since you can see the proposed changes.\nIf something is a limited test\nto a group of users, add it to the handbook and note as such. Then remove the note once the test is over and every case should use the new process.\nIf someone inside or outside GitLab makes a good suggestion invite them to add it to the handbook. Send the person the URL of the relevant page and section and offer to do it for them if they can‚Äôt. Having them make and send the suggestion will make the change and will reflect their knowledge.\nWhen you submit a merge request, make sure that it gets merged quickly. Making single, small changes quickly will ensure your branch doesn‚Äôt fall far behind master, creating merge conflicts. Aim to make and merge your update on the same day. Mention people in the merge request or reach them in Slack. If you get a suggestion for a large improvement on top of the existing one consider doing that separately. Create an issue, get the existing MR merged, then create a new merge request.\nIf you have to move content have a merge request that moves it and does nothing else. If you want to clean it up, summarize it, or expand on it do that after the moving MR is merged. This is much easier to review.\nTry to\nadd the why of a handbook process\n, what is the business goal, what is the inspiration for this section. Adding the why makes processes easier to change in the future since you can evaluate if the why changed.\nWhen adding or changing a process in the\nengineering workflow\n, consider scheduling a retro\nmonths out. The retro is an opportunity to\nconsider the effects\nof the new process and determine if it needs further iteration or can be removed.\nConsiderations when adding an additional process\nWhile not a requirement, it can be useful to schedule an async retro MR/issue\nmonths out after the introduction of a new process.\nConsider identifying an improvement target and timeframe to determine what success is. You can use the retro MR/issue to transparently communicate expectations as well to provide a means to iterate or remove the new process.\nThe creation of the retro MR/issue is an opportunity to think through:\nWhat do we hope this new process accomplishes?\nIs there a metric we can use to measure the effect of the new process?\nAre there outcomes of the new process that would prompt us to roll it back?\nThe retro itself is an opportunity to document:\nHow do the participants in the process think things are going?\nWhat additional costs are associated with the new process?\nWere there any unforeseen side effects of the new process?\nDo the participants have suggestions for ways to mitigate any costs realized by the new process, or further improvements in general?\nInformation architecture\nSingle Source of Truth\nThink about the information architecture to eliminate repetition and have a Single Source of Truth (SSoT). Instead of repeating content cross-link it (each text has a hyperlink to the other piece). If you copy content please remove it at the origin place and replace it with a link to the new content. Duplicate content leads to more work by having to update the content in multiple places as well as the need to remember where all of the out of date content lives. When you have a single source of truth it‚Äôs only stored in a single system.\nMake sure to always cross-link items if there are related items (elsewhere in the handbook, in docs, or in issues).\nSystem of Record\nA system of record (SoR) is the authoritative data source for a given data element or piece of information. It‚Äôs worth noting that while it is possible to have a system of record that is also a single source of truth, simply just being a system of record doesn‚Äôt directly imply it is the single source of truth.\nOrganized by Function and Results\nThe handbook is\norganized by function and result\nto ensure every item in it has a location and owner to keep it up to date.\nIt‚Äôs essential that we adhere to this hierarchy and that we not maintain separate structures for company training materials (such as onboarding materials, how-tos, etc.), videos, or other documentation.\nAdhering to this hierarchy is sometimes counter-intuitive.\nWe‚Äôve learned over the years that keeping content in context helps to ensure consistency when making future updates.\nAt times, a change of perspective may be desired.\nIn those cases, link to relevant sections of the handbook but don‚Äôt include the content itself.\nSee the\nonboarding template\n(internal) as an example.\nOr for example a list of\nKey Performance Indicators\nthat links to performance indicators but doesn‚Äôt duplicate definitions.\nStyle guide\nRead through these style guidance below and the\nWriting Style Guidelines\nbefore\nediting the handbook\n.\nHandbook pages\nKeep your handbook pages short and succinct. Eliminate fluff and get right to the point with the shortest possible wording.\nKeep in mind that the biggest challenge cited by new employees is the vast amount of information to take in during onboarding.\nAvoid unstructured content\nAvoid unstructured content based on formats like Learning Playbooks,\nFAQs\nThese are very hard to keep up-to-date and are not compatible with organization per function and result. For example: Call it Contract Negotiation Handbook instead of Contract Negotiation Playbook\nInstead, put the answer, link, definition, course, video, or test in the most relevant place.\nUse descriptive headings so that people can easily search for content.\nThat said, please mix\nformats\nwhere and when appropriate in the handbook, even within a single page.\nUtilizing multiple formats can be valuable, and different people may prefer certain formats over others.\nWorry only about the organization\nper function and result\n, not about how the page will look if you embed varying types and formats of content.\nNote: A weakness of\nFAQs\nis that questions are often asked in biased or leading ways. When possible, state facts as facts.\nUse headings liberally\nIf a page includes more than two headings (especially if it‚Äôs larger than a single ‚Äúscreen‚Äù), add an automatically generated Table of Contents (ToC) by copying\nline 6 to 10 in this MR\n.\nHeadings should have normal capitalization: don‚Äôt use\nor\nTitleCase\n.\nAfter a heading, leave one blank line; this is\nnot required in the standard\n, but it is our convention.\nUse contributable diagrams\nPreference contributable diagrams over uploading images or other less contributable diagrams. This makes it easier for other people to suggest changes and contribute. Diagram options in Markdown include\nMermaid\nand\nPlantUML\n.\nHandbook First Competency\nIn an all-remote, asynchronous organization, each team member should practice handbook first. For more information on what it means to be handbook first, please refer to the\nwhy handbook first\nsection of this page.\nSkills and behaviors of handbook first as a Team Member\n:\nActively contributes to the handbook.\nStart with a merge request\nProvides links to information from the handbook when answering questions and if the information doesn‚Äôt exist in the handbook, then the team member adds it.\nUnderstands which information is internal-only, but puts all public information in the public handbook.\nSkills and behaviors of handbook first as a People Leader\n:\nHolds their team and others accountable for being handbook first.\nDemonstrates leadership in being public handbook first with all information that is not internal-only.\nEnables new team members and managers on how to leverage the handbook as a resource.\nServes as a role model for what it means to be handbook first.\nManagement\nIt is each department and team member‚Äôs responsibility to ensure the handbooks (public handbook, and internal handbook) stay current. The content in the handbook should be accurate and follow the same format as outlined in the\nGuidelines\n. For questions on who to submit a merge request to, or assistance with the handbook, please reach out on the\n#handbook\nSlack channel.\nIf you need permissions to directly commit changes to the handbook, please submit a\nNew Access Request\nissue and follow the process for access approval. Request a ‚ÄòMaintainer‚Äô role for the appropriate handbook.\nMerge Rights Guidelines\nYou need\ndeveloper\naccess\nto the relevant handbook project to merge MRs. All team members should have developer access by default. This page contains some tips and guidelines that you should keep in mind when merging.\nMerge with confidence\nYou should feel confident merging any changes that pass the pipeline without worrying that you will break the handbook. The tests in the pipeline are designed to catch any major problems. The handbook projects are configured so that changes cannot be merged unless the pipeline passes. In the event that code is merged that does break the handbook in some way, follow the instructions for\nreporting an issue to the Handbook team\n.\nDo not use merge immediately\nDo\nnot\nuse the\nmerge immediately\nfeature! Even if your MR is important and time-sensitive, using this feature will create a lot of pain for everyone else. This feature should only be used when critical public information needs to be sent live as quickly as possible and should be approved by PR or Legal.\nIf you don‚Äôt have PR or Legal approval, don‚Äôt use this feature\n.\nMore context on the technical reasons behind this:\nWe want to have a fast pipeline for the default branch, which minimizes the time needed for changes to be deployed and appear live on the production site.\nIn order to achieve this, we do not run any tests or linters on the default branch, because these are long-running jobs which would block a fast deployment.\nInstead, we rely on the\nMerge Train\nto ensure that all Merge Request changes have successfully passed all necessary test/lint jobs before being allowed to merge.\nSo, if you use ‚Äúmerge immediately‚Äù,\nnone of the test/lint jobs will be run, which will result in a broken default branch if problems were introduced.\nThis means that\neveryone who creates new MRs off of the default branch after this point will experience confusing pipeline failures which are not their fault\n, and this will continue until this situation is discovered and a fix is merged to the default branch.\nWhen to get approval\nGetting pinged to approve every small change to your page can be annoying, but\nsomeone changing a policy or procedure in the handbook without proper approval\ncan have strong negative consequences. Use your best judgement on when to ask\nfor approvals.\nWhenever reasonable, practice\nresponsibility over rigidity\n. When you expect a page owner will appreciate your changes, go ahead and merge them without approval. Always ping the code owners with an @mention comment to inform them of the changes. They will be happy their page was made better and they didn‚Äôt need to waste time reviewing and approving the change. In the event that something isn‚Äôt an improvement, we practice\nclean up over sign off\n.\nWhenever appropriate, such as publishing a previously internal-only document,\nget approval from the\ncode owner\nusing the\napproval feature\nbefore merging changes.\nWho can approve\nYou can identify the owner of a handbook page by visiting the page on the web\nversion of the handbook and viewing who is in the\nMaintainers\nsection on the\npage being edited (on the right hand side of the page, which may be hidden on a\nsmaller browser window).\nFor some pages, the\nMaintainers\nsection is empty. This is because the page is\nmaintained by a group rather than individuals. To view which groups or\nindividuals maintain a page, see the\nfile of the relevant repository, such as\nthe handbook‚Äôs\n.\nThe page‚Äôs code owners will also be visible when viewing the\napproval section\nof the merge request.\nThe page‚Äôs code owner is the DRI for the page and has the final say for what\nappears in the handbook. When in doubt, get the DRI‚Äôs permission before changing\ntheir page. Don‚Äôt worry if the DRI is a C-level person. You can still assign\nyour MRs to them, even if you are an individual contributor. This is because we\nprefer to\ncommunicate directly\n.\nHave a peer review your changes\nUnless it‚Äôs a small change like a typo, always have another team member review your changes before you merge them.\nBroad Permissions\nBeing a maintainer gives you access to much more than just the ability to merge. You can see a\nfull list of permissions\nin the docs. Keep in mind that you‚Äôll have access to a broad set of settings and configuration for the project. Don‚Äôt adjust any settings or make any structural changes.\nGranting others maintain access\nDo not grant people maintainer access without an\nAccess Request\n. As a maintainer you have the ability to grant others maintainer access. Don‚Äôt do so without following the Access Request process to garner the appropriate approvals and create the necessary documentation.\nDescription Templates for Issues and Merge Requests\nThe\ndescription templates\nfor issues and merge requests in the various projects are respectively located in the\n.gitlab/issue_templates\nand\n.gitlab/merge_request_templates\ndirectories, and can be edited and changed with a new merge request.\nChanges to the default templates in\nDefault.md\nrequire review by the\nOffice of the CEO\nor the\n. See\n.gitlab/CODEOWNERS\nfor the current list of approvers.\nThe Internal handbook\nWhere can it be found?\nInternal Handbook Project\nLive Website\nWhy is there a internal handbook?\nAs a company, we are\npublic by default\n, but there are things that we cannot discuss publicly. The Internal Handbook is a space where team members can share internal information. Anything that\nis not\nconsidered\ninternal only\n, should be in GitLab‚Äôs\npublic handbook\n. Anything that is\nlimited access\nshould not be added to the internal handbook\nas the internal handbook is accessible by all team members.\nThe process of using this handbook\nOnly add items to the internal handbook that fall into the\nnot public\ncategory. Everything else should be added to our\npublic company handbook\n.\nAccessing the internal handbook group\nAll team members have access to the internal handbook through Okta as baseline access during onboarding. Login to your Okta dashboard and click on the\nGitLab Internal Handbook\ntile. You will have to authenticate with Okta first.\nQuestions using the internal handbook\nQuestions about what should be in the internal handbook vs in the public handbook?  See the\nsafe framework\nor ask in\n#safe\n.\nVolunteering to help with enhancing it?  Join the\n#internal-handbook\nchannel.\nThe Engineering team and all sub-teams track Handbook Update Frequency as a\n, with varying targets per team. Currently, Engineering is the only Division tracking Handbook update frequency, so as to analyze and observe the effectiveness of this KPI.\nExternal use of the Handbook\nRemember that, like virtually everything we do, our handbook is\nopen source\n, and we expect that other companies may use it as inspiration for their own documentation and practices. That said, the handbook should always be specific on\nwhat we do\n, not\nwho we want to be\n, and every company will need to fill out their own handbooks over time. Our handbook falls under the\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license\n.\nInspired by GitLab\nIf your company has been inspired by GitLab‚Äôs handbook, we would love to know what inspired you. Please see our\nInspired by GitLab page\n.\nMake it worthwhile\nAnother company asked how we managed to work with the handbook because at their company it wasn‚Äôt working: ‚ÄúThere are many occasions where something is documented in the knowledge base, but people don‚Äôt know about it because they never bothered to read or search. Some people have a strong aversion against what they perceive as a ‚Äòwall of text‚Äô.‚Äù\nWe attempt to cover this in GitLab‚Äôs\nguide to embracing a handbook-first approach to documentation\n.\nTo ensure that people‚Äôs time is well spent looking at the handbook we should follow the ‚Äòhandbook guidelines‚Äô above, and also:\nFollow the\nwriting style guide\n.\nHave a great search function, plus make it public so you can\nGoogle search\n.\nTest people on their\nknowledge\nduring onboarding.\nGive real examples.\nAvoid corporate speak, describe things like you‚Äôre talking to a friend. For more, see our communications guide on\nSimple Language\n.\nWiki handbooks don‚Äôt scale\nCompany handbooks\nfrequently start as wikis\n.\nThis format is more comfortable for people to work in than a static website with GitLab Merge Requests and GitLab Pages.\nHowever wikis tend to go stale over time, where they are badly organized and get out of date.\nIn wikis it is impossible to make proposals that touch multiple parts of a page and/or multiple pages. Therefore it is hard to reorganize the handbook. Because GitLab Merge Requests and GitLab Pages are based on distributed version control you can split the role of submitter and approver. This allows for a division of work that keeps the handbook up to date:\nAnyone who can read the handbook can make a proposal\nLeaders (who tend to be short on time) only have to approve such a proposal\nWikis also do not encourage collaboration on changes, because there is no way to discuss a proposed change like there is with merge requests.\nSome wikis make it hard to view and/or link to diffs of changes, which is needed to communicate decisions.\nSid and Paul Discussion on the benefits of markdown handbooks and limitations of wikis\nLast modified July 8, 2025:\nEUS - Access Requests Update (\nb88590d3\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 5027}

The\nadvantage can be quoted from the\nWikipedia page for convention over\nconfiguration:\n‚Äúdecrease the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining\nsimplicity, and not necessarily losing flexibility‚Äù. In GitLab you only have to\nspecify unconventional aspects of your workflow. The happy path is\nfrictionless from planning to monitoring\n.\nWe‚Äôre doubling down on our product for concurrent DevOps which brings the entire\nlifecycle into one application and lets everyone contribute. We are leaning into\nwhat our customers have told us they love: our single application strategy, our\npace of iteration, and our deep focus on users.\nConsider opportunities to take advantage of this unique attribute in early\niterations. Integrating features with different parts of the application can\nincrease the adoption of early iterations. Other advantages:\nA minimal viable feature that is well integrated can be more useful than a\nsophisticated feature that is not integrated.\nAlthough not every feature needs to be integrated with other parts of the\napplication, you should consider if there are unique or powerful benefits for\nintegrating the feature more deeply in the second or third iteration.\nGitLab.com\nGitLab.com runs GitLab Enterprise Edition.\nTo keep our code easy to maintain and to make sure everyone reaps the benefits\nof all our efforts, we will not separate GitLab.com codebase from the Enterprise Edition codebase.\nTo avoid complexity,\nGitLab.com tiers and GitLab self-managed tiers\nare named the same.\nGitLab.com subscription scope and tiers\nGitLab.com subscriptions work on a namespace basis, which can mean:\npersonal namespace, e.g.\nJaneDoe/*\ngroup namespace, e.g.\ngitlab-org/\nThis means that group-level features are only available on the group namespace.\nPublic projects get Ultimate for free.\nPublic groups\ndo not\nget Ultimate for free. Because:\nThis would add significant additional complexity to the way we structure our features, licenses and groups. We don‚Äôt want to discourage public groups, yet it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to have a public group with only private projects and for that group to still get all the benefits of Ultimate. That would make buying a license for GitLab.com almost entirely moot.\nAll value of group level features is aimed at organisations, i.e. managers and up (see our\nstewardship\n). The aim with giving all features away for free is to enable and encourage open source projects. The benefit of group-level features for open source projects is significantly diminished, therefore.\nAlternative solutions are hard to understand, and hard to maintain.\nAdmittedly, this is complex and can be confusing for product managers when implementing features.\nIdeas to simplify this are welcome (but note that making personal namespaces equal to groups is not one of\nthem, as that introduces other issues).\nFor more guidance on feature tiers and pricing, visit\ntiering guidance for features\nDeprecations & Removals Policy\nDefinitions\nSee the\nterminology of deprecations\n.\nIs this a breaking change?\nBy definition, a removal is a breaking change. With a\nfew exceptions\n, if the answer is yes to any of the following questions, the change is to be considered a breaking change and should be avoided other than for critical business risk.\nDoes this change require an action from the customer to ensure continuity of function? (For example, removing background upload for object storage meant users needed to migrate objects to a supported object storage provider)\nDoes this change cause a disruption to a customer‚Äôs workflows or tasks? (For example, removing support for the ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù prefix in MRs meant users would need to use the ‚ÄúDraft:‚Äù prefix instead)\nDoes this change cause other parts of the product to fail? (For example, removing certificate-based cluster integration means users can no longer install additional applications via GitLab Managed Apps)\nFor special definitions of what constitutes a breaking change for our APIs, see:\nREST API breaking changes\n.\nGraphQL API breaking changes\n.\nFor\nExperiment\nor\nBeta\nfeatures, please see\nSupport for experiment, beta, and generally available features\n.\nExceptions for breaking changes\nIntroducing a\nbreaking change in a minor release is against policy\nbecause it can disrupt our customers, however there are some rare exceptions:\nWhen GitLab establishes that delaying a breaking change would overall have a\nsignificantly\nmore negative impact to customers compared to shipping it in a minor release.\nIf an integrated service shuts down, the integration can be removed during a minor release.\nIn all cases, the PM or EM must\nfollow the Request a Breaking Change process\n.\nDeprecating and removing features\nDeprecating and removing a feature needs to follow a specific process because it is important that we minimize disruption for our users. As you move through the process, use the language\ndeprecated\nor\nremoved\nto specify the current state of the feature that is going to be or has been removed.\nProcess for deprecating and removing a feature\nPlease follow the\nprocess outlined in the docs\n.\nBreaking Change Windows on GitLab.com\nWe deploy changes to GitLab.com many times a day. Because they are part of a continuous delivery process, these changes, including breaking changes, are not as predictable for customers.\nStarting from GitLab 17.0, we introduced fixed windows during which breaking changes are rolled out to GitLab.com. The fixed windows are set as the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the three weeks preceding the major release date, typically following the X.11 release date. A detailed example of what this looks like can be found in\nour 17.0 introduction issue\n.\nBreaking changes should only be enabled during the breaking change windows. This means that where breaking changes are behind feature flags, the changes (feature flag) should only be switched during one of these windows to ensure customers workflows are not impacted outside of these communicated periods.\nProduct Managers will be responsible for making sure that as part of the deprecations and removals process, where applicable the deprecation/removal is aligned with a publicly communicated Breaking Change Window.\nIn June of 2023, we changed the process so that all deprecations and removals are displayed on\nthe Deprecations page\n.\nThe announcements are grouped by the milestone they will be removed in. The deprecation announcement date is listed below each individual item.\nSyntax deprecation process\nOur CI syntax keeps evolving. We cannot support all keywords indefinitely, so deprecating and removing keywords is inevitable.\nGitLab does not have a versioning system for CI/CD configuration. Therefore, it is critical to over-communicate our deprecation purposes to our users and take the necessary precautions to reduce the impact on their projects. Deprecating a keyword is risky because it will break all pipelines using it, and in some cases, users are not aware of the keyword they use in their pipeline. The deprecation process described below is similar to the\ndeprecating and removing features\nprocess, with additional steps to reduce the risks which involved with removing a CI/CD keyword.\nDeprecation notice - Syntax removal introduces a breaking change, as outlined in our deprecation process, we must notify the community and customers, which means including a deprecation notice in the monthly release post.\nTrack keyword usage - Tracking keyword usage should begin as early as possible. It is a mandatory step that helps estimate the user impact, timing, and needed effort. The more users use the keyword, the more time it takes to remove it (It took more than four years to move from\nremove\nto\ndeprecation\nfor ‚Äôtype‚Äô keyword).\nIn-app warning - Provide our users with an in-app notification that we plan to remove a keyword they use in their pipeline. Our customers will get a notification in each run of the pipeline that uses the deprecated keyword. The warning will be printed:\nAt run time on the pipeline page and logs.\nIn the pipeline editor, while authoring a pipeline.\nThis step is optional if the keyword usage is relatively low (Recommend minimal reach of ~5% impacted users).\nKeyword removal - The keyword will be removed from our code and schema and should happen in a major version. Once removed,  using the keyword will result in a lint error.\nNaming features\nNaming new features or\nrenaming existing features\nis notoriously hard and sensitive to many opinions.\nFactors in picking a name\nIt should clearly express what the feature is, in order to avoid the\nAWS naming situation\n.\nIt should follow\nusability heuristics\nwhen in doubt.\nIt should be common in the industry.\nIt should not overlap with any other existing concepts in GitLab.\nIt should have as few words as possible (so people won‚Äôt use a shortened name).\nIf you remove words from the name, it is still unique (helps to give it as few words as possible).\nWe should also give products descriptive, not distinctive, names, and use prepositions when referring to third-party products and services in names. See our\nProduct Principles\nfor more information.\nProcess\nIt‚Äôs highly recommended to start discussing this as early as possible.\nSeek a broad range of opinions and consider the arguments carefully.\nThe PM responsible for the area involved should make the final decision and not delay the naming.\nNaming should definitely not be a blocker for a feature being released.\nReaching consensus is not the goal and not a requirement for establishing a name.\nRenaming\nThe bar for renaming existing features is extremely high, especially for long-time features with a lot of usage.\nSome valid but not exclusive reasons are:\nNew branding opportunities\nReducing confusion as we introduce new adjacent features\nReducing confusion as we re-factor existing features\nWhen renaming features follow the process\nto rename a category\nstarting with an MR to change the name in\ndata/features.yml\n. Request review by the Product Director and Engineering Director of your Section for approval. Optionally, add a comment including your technical writer, engineering manager, product design manager, and product designer for transparency.\nWhen renaming a feature other items to consider are updates to documentation, blogs, direction pages and competitive information.\nUsing What‚Äôs New to communicate updates to users\nWhat‚Äôs New is a feature that is part of GitLab.com and Self-managed GitLab that is used to communicate highlights from each release. After each major release, a\nyaml file is published\nthat contains 3-10 highlights from the release along with links to the relevant documentation to get started using them.\nA small notification dot appears above the ‚Äú?‚Äù icon, and when users click on ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new‚Äù in the menu, a drawer containing the updates slides into view.\nThe goal of What‚Äôs New is to make it easy for users to be aware of the most important changes in GitLab so we can help them stay up-to-date on all of our changes and feature updates.\nPermissions in GitLab\nUse this section as guidance for using existing features and developing new ones.\nGuests are not active contributors in private projects. They can only see, and leave comments and issues.\nReporters are read-only contributors: they can‚Äôt write to the repository, but can on issues.\nDevelopers are direct contributors, and have access to everything to go from idea to production,\nunless something has been explicitly restricted (e.g. through branch protection).\nMaintainers are super-developers: they are able to push to master, deploy to production.\nThis role is often held by maintainers and engineering managers.\nAdmin-only features can only be found in\n/admin\n. Outside of that, admins are the same as the highest possible permission (owner).\nOwners are essentially group-admins. They can give access to groups and have\ndestructive capabilities.\nAuditor cannot access\n/admin\n, group settings, and project settings. Auditor has read-only access to all other areas.\nTo keep the permissions system clear and consistent we should improve our roles to match common flows\ninstead of introducing more and more permission configurations on each resource, if at all possible.\nFor big instances with many users, having one role for creating projects, doing code review and managing teams may be insufficient.\nSo, in the long term, we want our permission system to explicitly cover the next roles:\nAn owner. A role with destructive and workflow enforcing permissions.\nA manager. A role to keep a project running, add new team members etc.\nA higher development role to do code review, approve contributions, and other development related tasks.\nAll the above can be achieved by iteratively improving existing roles.\nDocumentation on permissions\nSecurity Paradigm\nYou can now find our\nsecurity paradigm\non the\nSecure Strategy\npage.\nAlso see our\nSecure Team engineering handbook\n.\nStatistics and performance data\nTraditionally, applications only reveal valuable information about usage and\nperformance to administrators. However, most GitLab instances only have a handful of\nadmins and they might not sign in very often. This means interesting data is rarely\nseen, even though it can help to motivate teams to learn from other teams,\nidentify issues or simply make people in the organisation aware of adoption.\nTo this end, performance data and usage statistics should be available to all users\nby default. It‚Äôs equally important that this can be optionally restricted to admins-only,\nas laws in some countries require this, such as Germany.\nInternationalisation\nGitLab is developed in English, but supports the contribution of other\nlanguages.\nGitLab will always default to English. We will not infer the language /\nlocation / nationality of the user and change the language based on that.\nYou can‚Äôt safely infer user preferences from their system settings either.\nTechnical users are used to this, usually writing software in English,\neven though their language in the office is different.\nPerformance\nFast applications are better applications. Everything from the core user experience,\nto building integrations and using the API is better if every query is quick, and\nevery page loads fast. When you‚Äôre building new features, performance has to be top of mind.\nWe must strive to make every single page fast. That means it‚Äôs not acceptable for new\npages to add to performance debt. When they ship, they should be fast.\nYou must account for all cases, from someone with a single object, to thousands of objects.\nRead the handbook page relating to\nperformance of GitLab.com\n, and note the Speed Index target shown there\n(read it thoroughly if you need a detailed overview of performance). Then:\nMake sure that new pages and interactions meet the Speed Index target.\nExisting pages should never be significantly slowed down by the introduction of new features\nor changes.\nPages that load very slowly (even if only under certain conditions) should be sped up by\nprioritizing work on their performance, or changes that would lead to improved page load speeds\n(such as pagination, showing less data, etc).\nAny page that takes more than 4 seconds to load (speed index) should be considered too slow.\nUse the\navailability & performance priority labels\nto communicate and prioritize issues relating to performance.\nYou must prioritize improvements according to their impact (per the\navailability & performance priority labels\n).\nPages that are visited often should be prioritized over pages that rarely have any visitors.\nHowever, if page load time approaches 4 seconds or more, they are considered no longer\nusable and should be fixed at the earliest opportunity.\nRestriction of closed source JavaScript\nIn addition, to meet the\nethical criteria of GNU\n,\nall our JavaScript code on GitLab.com has to be free as in freedom.\nRead more about this on\nGNU‚Äôs website\n.\nWhy cycle time is important\nThe ability to monitor, visualize and improve upon cycle time (or: time to\nvalue) is fundamental to GitLab‚Äôs product. A shorter cycle time will allow you\nto:\nrespond to changing needs faster (i.e. skate to where the puck is going to be)\nship smaller changes\nmanage regressions, rollbacks, bugs better, because you‚Äôre shipping smaller changes\nmake more accurate predictions\nfocus on improving customer experience, because you‚Äôre able to respond to their needs faster\nWhen we‚Äôre adding new capabilities to GitLab, we tend to focus on things that\nwill reduce the cycle time for our customers. This is why we choose\nconvention over configuration\nand why we focus on automating the entire software development lifecycle.\nAll friction of setting up a new project and building the pipeline of tools you\nneed to ship any kind of software should disappear when using GitLab.\nPlays well with others\nWe understand that not everyone will use GitLab for everything all the time,\nespecially when first adopting GitLab. We want you to use more of GitLab because\nyou love that part of GitLab. GitLab plays well with others, even when you use\nonly one part of GitLab it should be a great experience.\nGitLab ships with built-in integrations to many popular applications. We aspire\nto have the world‚Äôs best integrations for Slack, JIRA, and Jenkins.\nMany other applications\nintegrate with GitLab\n, and we are open to adding new integrations to our\ntechnology partners page\n. New integrations with GitLab can vary in richness and complexity; from a simple webhook, and all the way to a\nProject Service\n.\nGitLab\nwelcomes and supports new integrations\nto be created to extend collaborations with other products.\nGitLab plays well with others by providing APIs for nearly anything you can do within GitLab.\nGitLab can be a\nprovider of authentication\nfor external applications.\nThere is some natural tension between GitLab being a single-application for the\nentire DevOps lifecycle, and our support for better user experience via integration\nwith existing DevOps tools. We‚Äôll prioritize first our efforts to improve the single-application\nexperience, second to enable a rich ecosystem of partners, and third to improve integration with the broader ecosystem\nto other tools. GitLab is open-source so this should not prohibit contributors adding\nintegrations for anything that they are missing - as long as it fits with GitLab product vision.\nIf you don‚Äôt have time to contribute and are a customer we‚Äôll gladly work with you to design the API addition or integration you need.\nAdvantages of a single application\nDiscussing the advantages of having a single application\nLast modified July 4, 2025:\nMove division specific includes to folder (\na74a8182\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 3041}

medium (2y), and long term (3y).\nThis serves as our strategic compass,\nhelping us balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability.\nThe Technical Roadmap is based on the\nProduct Roadmap\n,\nwhere Product provides the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù (customer needs) and ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù (business strategy).\nEngineers then determine the ‚ÄúHow‚Äù (technical implementation),\nwhile Engineering Managers plan the ‚ÄúWhen‚Äù (scheduling).\nThis comprehensive roadmap emphasizes building high-quality,\ncomplete features in a sustainable manner.\nThe Technical Roadmap serves three key purposes:\nIt helps build engineering excellence by addressing critical areas that might not show up in product backlogs,\nsuch as technical debt, performance improvements, platform improvements, and system scalability.\nIt enables the department to be proactive rather than reactive.\nBy regularly asking key questions like ‚ÄúWhere do we see the biggest instability in our systems?‚Äù or\n‚ÄúWhat is generating the most toil?‚Äù, we can address issues before they become critical problems.\nThis helps maintain our SLOs and keeps our customers happy.\nIt aligns engineering efforts with business goals, ensuring technical improvements drive GitLab‚Äôs success.\nEach technical roadmap item is prioritized based on business value and strategic alignment.\nCurrent State\nThe Infrastructure Roadmap is maintained as a static site.\nGitLab team-members can review the current technical roadmap,\nat\ninfra-roadmap.gitlab.com\n.\n:\nThe Infrastructure Roadmap is not publicly available as some of the projects and\ninitiatives may be considered\nunSAFE\n.\nThe site presents the roadmap in a visual manner, showing:\nDependencies between planned initiatives\nFiltering options by confidence, stage, or tags\nIndividual roadmaps for each stage within the department\nImpact analysis through dependency visualization\nUpdating the Roadmap\nChanges to the Roadmap are made through merge requests to the\ninfra-roadmap\nproject.\nThe data is stored in YAML format, and changes can be made by editing the YAML.\nThis allows for version control and collaborative discussion through the merge request process.\nFull instructions for making changes to the Infrastructure Roadmap are available\nin\nthe project‚Äôs README.md\n.\nEveryone is encouraged to contribute to the roadmap,\nwhether proposing new initiatives or making smaller changes\nlike updating descriptions or adding links to relevant issues.\nDesign\nThe\nInfrastructure Library\ncontains documents that outline our thinking about the problems we are solving and represents the\ncurrent state\nfor any topic, playing a significant role in how we produce technical solutions to meet the challenges we face.\nDogfooding\nThe Infrastructure department uses GitLab and GitLab features extensively as the main tool for operating many\nenvironments\n, including GitLab.com.\nWe follow the same\ndogfooding process\nas part of the Engineering function, while keeping the\ndepartment mission statement\nas the primary prioritization driver. The prioritization process is aligned to\nthe Engineering function level prioritization process\nwhich defines where the priority of dogfooding lies with regards to other technical decisions the Infrastructure department makes.\nWhen we consider building tools to help us operate GitLab.com, we follow the\n5x rule\nto determine whether to build the tool as a feature in GitLab or outside of GitLab. To track Infrastructure‚Äôs contributions back into the GitLab product, we tag those issues with the appropriate\nDogfooding\nlabel.\nHandbook use at the Infrastructure department\nAt GitLab, we have a\nhandbook first policy\n. It is how we communicate process changes, and how we build up a single source of truth for work that is being delivered every day.\nThe\nhandbook usage page guide\nlists a number of general tips. Highlighting the ones that can be encountered most frequently in the Infrastructure department:\nThe wider community can benefit from training materials, architectural diagrams, technical documentation, and how-to documentation. A good place for this detailed information is in the related project documentation. A handbook page can contain a high level overview, and link to more in-depth information placed in the project documentation.\nThink about the audience consuming the material in the handbook. A detailed run through of a GitLab.com operational runbook in the handbook might provide information that is not applicable to self-managed users, potentially causing confusion. Additionally, the handbook is not a go-to place for operational information, and grouping operational information together in a single place while explaining the general context with links as a reference will increase visibility.\nEnsure that the handbook pages are easy to consume. Checklists, onboarding, repeatable tasks should be either automated or created in a form of template that can be linked from the handbook.\nThe handbook is the process. The handbook describes our principles, and our epics and issues are our principles put into practice.\nProjects\nClassification of the Infrastructure department projects is described on the\ninfrastructure department projects page\n.\nThe\ninfrastructure issue tracker\nis the backlog and a catch-all project for the infrastructure teams and tracks the work our teams are doing‚Äìunrelated to an ongoing change or incident.\nIn addition to tracking the backlog, Infrastructure Department projects are captured in our\nInfrastructure Department Epic\nas well as in our\nQuarterly Objectives & Key Results\nSupporting Product Features\nWe have a model that we use to help us support product features.\nThis model\nprovides details on how we collaborate to ship new features to Production.\nStable Counterparts\nInfrastructure SREs may be aligned with\nstage groups\nas\nstable counterparts\n.\nStable Counterparts\nare used as a framework for managing reliable services at GitLab.

Drop a video below!\nTip\nUse AI to edit the handbook faster, and learn about\nAnthropic Claude\nand\nGitLab Duo\n.\nAdd yourself to the team page\nFor how to add yourself to the team page, see the\nadd yourself to team guide\n.\nMarkdown formatting\nFor how to format markdown in the handbook, see the\nmarkdown style guide\n,\nwhich includes how to embed videos.\nUse the Web IDE to edit the handbook\nA typical workflow to edit the handbook:\nUse the Web IDE to make changes\n.\nCommit changes\n.\nCreate a merge request\n,\nassign reviewers\n.\nApply suggestions\nif any, or make further changes if needed.\n‚ÄúSet to auto-merge‚Äù, or merge once all suggestions are resolved and you have the necessary approvals.\nWeb IDE steps to create a new MR\nNavigate to the handbook page you want to edit. At the bottom, or on the right, click on the URL\nto open the new Web IDE.\nAlternatively, open the\npublic handbook\nproject and select\nWeb IDE\nfrom the edit actions. This requires you to navigate into the source tree where the handbook files are located.\nFamiliarize yourself with the\nWeb IDE\n:\nThe menu sections are located on the left\nThe explorer section provides the file tree for the project, which is opened automatically when editing a handbook file. (keyboard shortcut:\nShift+Cmd+E\n)\nThe editing view is on the right side. On top, there are tabs to organize open files.\nAdditional meta information is provided at the bottom. Git branch, problems, current line number, spaces for indentation, encoding, end-of-line sequence, language mode, layout, notifications.\nTip:\nHover over the menu sections and items to learn more about their purpose and keyboard shortcuts.\nEdit the selected file, and try the Markdown preview.\nCmd+Shift+P\non macOS opens the Web IDE command palette to search for commands. For example, type\nMarkdown\n, select\nMarkdown: Open Preview to the Side\nand try the preview.\nNote that the\nhandbook markdown engine\nsupports more rendering features than the\nWeb IDE preview based on VS Code\n, and some items won‚Äôt be rendered properly. Commit and create a\ndraft merge request\nto view the handbook\nreview apps\nto preview the page, such as to verify embedded images.\nUpload new files by right-clicking and selecting\nUpload...\nfor example images into\nstatic/images/handbook/\nand the corresponding file tree, following the handbook directories.\nNote the\nimages section\nin the markdown guide.\nOpen the\nSource Control\nicon on the left menu which has a colored marker for counting the file changes. Tip: Keyboard shortcut\nCtrl+Shift+G\n.\nReview the changed files, and once ready, specify a Git commit message. The message should be a brief (less than 120 characters) description of your changes.\nClick on the ‚ãÅ on the right side of the\nCommit and push\nbutton, and choose the\nCreate new branch and commit\noption. Keyboard shortcut:\nCmd+Enter\n.\nSpecify a new Git branch name (optional). Press\nEnter\nto continue. This action pushes the changes into the Git repository. The changes are persisted on the GitLab server and are immediately visible in the project view.\nCheck the pop-up at the bottom right, and click\nCreate Merge Request\nto open the GitLab MR tab. Tip: The notification bell icon at the bottom brings back the notification, if accidentally dismissed.\nFill in the MR template, provide why the merge request is created, add labels (optionally using quick actions,\n/label ~handbook\n), assign yourself (\n/assign me\n), and set the branch to delete when merged. Optionally, use the\ndraft option\nto prevent merging until ready.\nTip\n: Practice the keyboard shortcuts for your workflows: After making changes,\nControl+Shift+G\nto commit,\nCmd+Enter\n, Cursor to select the branch,\nEnter\n, etc.\nNote:\nThe\nCmd+w\nkeyboard shortcut to close a file tab in the Web IDE gets overridden by the Chrome browser to close the browser tab. This is a\nknown problem\n, use this shortcut carefully.\nWeb IDE steps to edit an existing MR\nIf you are editing an existing merge request (MR), there are 2 main differences from creating a new MR:\nwhere to open the editor, and where to commit to.\nMake additional changes to the MR: Select\nCode > Open in Web IDE\non the upper right menu. This opens the Web IDE again to make changes. All changed files are opened automatically.\nMake changes (see previous section for details), go to the\nSource Control\narea, add a commit message, and click on the\nCommit and push\nbutton. If you create a new branch, you will end up with a new MR instead of editing the existing one.\nOptional: Follow the pop-up notification to navigate back to the MR. Alternatively, close the editor tab if you did not close the MR tab.\nVideo: Editing using the Web IDE and single file editor\nNote: The video shows the old\nwww-gitlab-com\nproject. The editing process, however, is the same.\nThis video covers:\nEditing the marketing handbook as example\naction using the Web IDE, overview walkthrough, editing the handbook, again creating a merge request with the same actions.\nPractical handbook edit tips shown in this handbook.\nHistorical videos\nthe instructions cannot be followed exactly since the editor and repository in GitLab has changed\n.\nCreating new handbook pages and multimedia embedding best-practices\nHow to move the location of a handbook page\nChanging a page name and subsequent updates\nCreating mermaid diagrams\nCreating issue templates\nAdding images to the handbook and handbook analytics\nHow to add a new directory and page to the handbook\nHow to rebase to fix a failing pipeline after fix is merged to main\nWhy a handbook pipeline is failing\nHow to identify why a pipeline is failing\nEditing the handbook locally\nSet up an\nSSH key\nto use with GitLab, if you have not previously done so.\nSet up Git\nand clone the appropriate repository, such as the\npublic handbook\n.\nUse your editor of choice to make changes. If you use\nVisual Studio Code\noptionally along with the\nGitLab Workflow extension for VS Code\n, you can follow the\nWeb IDE editing instructions\n.\nPush the changes to GitLab\n.\nCreate a merge request.\nAdditional notes:\nWe don‚Äôt need\n.gitkeep files\nin our handbook, they make it harder to quickly open a file in editors. Don‚Äôt add them, and delete them when you see them.\nIf you want to install a local version of the website to test and preview things locally,\nsee the\nhandbook development page\nfor instructions on how to set it up.\nPreview changes on GitLab\nTo preview your changes, deploy the review app:\nWait for the pipeline on the merge request (MR) to complete.\nEither on the ‚ÄúPipelines‚Äù tab, or in the pipeline widget on the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù tab of the MR, click on the circles that denote the different pipeline stages until you find the\nStage:deploy\nand the\npages\njob.\nNext to the\npages\njob name, click on the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button.\nOnce\ntwo\npages\njobs complete, in the pipeline widget on the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù tab of the MR, click on the ‚ÄúView app‚Äù button.\nYou may need to navigate to your page by going to any page, then using the left navigation tree. Do not use the search for this.\nIf you prefer to edit the URL, note that the review app uses a\n.html\nending, so if your page is\ncontent/handbook/path/to/page.md\n, the URL will be\nreview/app/public/handbook/path/to/path.html\n.\nIf you need the review app deployed after every change on a MR, you can add the\n~\"deploy-review-app-always\"\nlabel to always trigger the job, including on MR creation.\nFor more information about how the review apps are configuration for the handbook projects, please see the\nHandbook Pages Deployment\n.\nNaming pages and folder structure\nThe site uses the concept of page bundles, sections, and leaf pages.  A section can have multiple leaf pages, which requires a\n_index.md\nfor the section.  A page bundle is a single page with a group of images, which can be an\nindex.md\n.\nIn general, Handbook URLs should describe their content and be as clean and easy to remember as possible.\nDirectories (folders) and pages should use lowercase\na-z\n, hyphen\n-\n, and underscore\n_\n.\nWhile Git and Hugo allow any UTF-8 character to be used in the file path, using other characters (such as a space) can cause issues with the pipeline, and thus, disallowed.\nSection:\nsection-dir/\nPage bundle:\npage-name/\nSection with a page bundle:\nsection-dir/\nMoving, deleting, or renaming a page\nIf you delete, rename, or move a page, you should:\nupdate all existing links\nin the handbook\nand\ninternal handbook.\nNote: When searching for links, use the page name. Sometimes links use page-relative links, meaning it doesn‚Äôt use the full path.\nPlease also consider searching for and updating handbook links in other places, such as\ndocs\nand project templates in\ngitlab-com\nand\ngitlab-org\n.\nadd a redirect\n.\nEditing page maintainers\nOn the right side of the page, there is a list ‚ÄúMaintainers‚Äù.\nThe list is generated from the\nfile in the relevant repository, such as in\nthe handbook repository\n:\nOnly specific users are listed. Members of a group are not listed.\nThe list is generated based on the most specific path:\nIf users are specified for a directory and then for a specific page in that directory,\nthe list only includes the users for the specific page.\nIf groups or subgroups are listed for a specific page without any specific users,\nthe list of maintainers is empty.\nChanges to the\n.gitlab/CODEOWNERS\nfile require approval.\nReview the bot comment for instructions on how to get the appropriate approval.\nEditing content from shortcodes\nWhen trying to edit content, you may encounter content that is ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù using\nshortcodes\nand data files.\nShortcodes look similar to\n{{\n% performance-indicators \"ux_department\" %\n}}\n.\nWhen you encounter content in a shortcode and want to edit it:\nLook for the shortcode in the\nshortcodes folder\n.\nIn the above example, it‚Äôs\nperformance-indicators\n.\nAt the top of the shortcode file should be a comment on where to look for the relevant data file. Ensure you‚Äôre using ‚ÄúDisplay source‚Äù to view the file.\nFor example, look in\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/data/performance_indicators\nfor the\nux_department\nfile.\nIf there is no comment, you can post in\n#handbook\nto get help, and make a MR to add it.\nEdit the file\n, being careful to match the existing formatting.\nTeam member merge requests being labeled as Community contributions\nIf you recently created a merge request that was labeled as a Community contribution, you can fix this mislabeling issue going forward by updating the GitLab username in your personal entry in the team member directory to match the GitLab account you use for work.\nUse the\nteam page editing instructions\nto find your team page entry file, and update the\ngitlab\nattribute (typically found on line 10) to be an\nexact match\nfor the GitLab.com username you use for work.\nTroubleshooting\n404 errors with edit action\nWhen clicking on\nin the upper right corner on a handbook page in your browser, you might get a\n404\nerror in the GitLab Web IDE.\nAs a team member, this problem can be related to an expired SAML session for your GitLab.com profile. In order to mitigate and solve the problem, click on\nView page source\nto trigger the SAML authentication with Okta again.\nAlternatively, navigate into our GitLab.com profile into\nyour To-Do list\n, or try to open a confidential issue, to trigger the authentication.\nIt can also be browser related: Try clearing the cache, open an incognito window (on macOS:\ncmd shift n\n), or use a different browser to test.\n404 on new page\nIf a new page is created as part of a merge request, but the page is not showing up on the site,\ncheck the file name.\nThe most common issue is using\nindex.md\ninstead of\n_index.md\nin a folder that has other pages.\nThe other pages will not display.\nSee\npages and folder structure\nfor more information.\nImages not loading properly\nIf you added new images and they are not loading properly in your review app, please review the\nImages section of the markdown guide\n.\nFailing pipelines\nTo see why your pipeline is failing, there are two main places to look:\nThe latest comment by the bot on your merge request. It should have a list of all linter errors. However, build errors do not generate a comment.\nIndividual failed jobs. On the MR > ‚ÄúPipelines‚Äù tab > select any red circle > select a failed job. Error messages are near the bottom of the job log and start with\nError\n.\nIn the job log, error messages typically provide you:\nthe error\nthe file where the error occurred\nthe line number\nthe character number (where on the line it is)\nFor example:\nError: error building site: assemble: \"/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/content/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/trust_center_guide.md:1:2\": closing tag for shortcode 'details' does not match start tag\nFile:\ncontent/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/trust_center_guide.md\nLine: 1\nCharacter: 2\nTo fix markdown errors, review the message. Alternatively, review the relevant section in the\nmarkdown style guide\n.\nFor all other errors, the error message should provide the information necessary to fix it.\nSee the below sections for more details on how to resolves specific types of issues.\nIf the problem was on the\nmain\nbranch, you may need to\nrebase\n.\nIf you‚Äôre unsure, you can\nreach out for help\n.\nLink and anchor errors\nThere is a linter (Hugolint) that validates links and anchors across the handbook. If your change introduces\nnew\nbroken links, then the pipeline job will fail. Follow the instructions in the\nprevious failing pipelines section\nfor how to find the list of errors.\nThere are two main reasons it will fail:\nContent added in the MR includes a broken link.\nContent changed in the MR breaks an existing link.\nHere‚Äôs an example of a failed\nhugolint\njob error message when viewed in the job log:\nNewly broken (only in \"linkcheck.json\", 3 issues):\n‚ùå [content/handbook/security/product-security/_index.md:43]: <major> Link destination \"architecture/\" does not exist\n‚ùå [content/handbook/security/product-security/security-architecture/_index.md:269]: <major> Link destination \"/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack/#panther\" does not exist\n‚ùå [content/handbook/security/product-security/security-architecture/zero-trust.md:45]: <major> Link destination \"/handbook/security/corporate/systems/#laptop-or-desktop-system-configuration\" does not exist\nThe error starts with the file where the broken link is present, followed by the line number.\n(For example, file path -\ncontent/handbook/security/product-security/_index.md\n, line number: 43.)\nNext, the error indicates which link is broken. (For example,\narchitecture/\nis the broken link destination.)\nFor broken or non-existent anchor links (for example,\n#panther\n):\nDid the MR change a heading that is being linked to? If so, you‚Äôll need to update the linked anchor to match the new heading.\nIf you‚Äôre linking to a heading, does it exists? Check the file in the repository instead of on the website. The links are checked pre-build, so generated content (from shortcodes and includes) don‚Äôt ‚Äúexist‚Äù for the link checker.\nIf the page you‚Äôre linking to has a large amount of generated content (such as performance indicator pages), you can\nadd an exclusion to\nhugolint\nin the relevant configuration file.\nFixing default branch errors\nMR pipelines should catch almost all errors before they are merged into the relevant repository.\nThe handbook projects also pull data from\nwww-gitlab-com\nyml\nfiles.\nIf the default branch\nmain\n(for public and internal handbook) or\nmaster\n(for\nwww-gitlab-com\n)\nis ‚Äúbroken‚Äù and pipelines are failing for everyone, the root issue is most likely a data file error.\nCheck the error message.\nIf it mentions an error in building the site, or rendering something, follow the trace.\nIn the layout file, if it‚Äôs failing on displaying on something\nthat starts with\nsite.Data.public.\n, then it‚Äôs a data file issue.\nThere are two ways to fix. Either:\nMake the code itself more robust to deal with the types of values it may encounter.\nHowever, not everyone knows Go and Hugo well enough to do that quickly.\nIf needed, create a ‚ÄúHandbook::Operations‚Äù ‚Äútype::bug‚Äù issue in the handbook repository to document the problem\nafter fixing the pipeline issue.\nEdit the data file to have values the build won‚Äôt fail on.\nExample: Fixing broken main on tech writing shortcode\nConsider this\nexample error\n:\nError: error building site: failed to render shortcode: \"/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/content/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/_index.md:126:1\": failed to render shortcode \"tech-writing\": failed to process shortcode: \"/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/layouts/shortcodes/tech-writing.html:16:28\": execute of template failed: template: shortcodes/tech-writing.html:16:28: executing \"shortcodes/tech-writing.html\" at <ref page (printf \"/handbook/product/categories#%s-section\" $section)>: error calling ref: parse \"/handbook/product/categories#%!s(<nil>)-section\": invalid URL escape \"%!s\"\nFollowing the error trace, notice that the last error with a full path and line number is:\nfailed to process shortcode: \"/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/layouts/shortcodes/tech-writing.html:16:28\"\n.\nLooking\nat the\ntech-writing\nshortcode\n,\nthe issue is an unexpected value in\nprintf \"/handbook/product/categories#%s-section\" $section\n,\nwhich matches the last part of the error message.\nFrom there,\nline 11 of the\ntech-writing\nshortcode\ntells us that the data is from\nsite.Data.public.stages.stages \"section\"\n.\nIf you have a local build of the site, you can find all the data files in the\ndata/public\nfolder.\nThe relevant file (usually a\nyml\nfile) should tell you at the top where to find the original.\nIf you do not have a local build, you can still likely find it in the\nwww-gitlab-com data folder\n.\nBased on the code, you can figure out the filename.\nsite.Data.public.stages.stages\nmeans it‚Äôs\nin\ndata/public\nand the file is\nstages.yml\n.\nThe last parts\n.stages \"section\"\nmeans it‚Äôs inside of\nstages:\nand it‚Äôs pulling data from\neach\nsection:\nline.\nYou can check the most recent changes to the file, and/or compare it to when\nmain\nstarted failing.\nIn this case,\nan empty\nsection:\nline\nwas the issue.\nThe quick and easy fix is to add text to the empty\nsection:\nline, merge it, and run a new pipeline\nin the public handbook project.\nIn this case,\nthe handbook code was made more robust\n.\nPrettier is formatting markdown files\nIf you have\nprettier\nset up in VS Code and it is formatting the\n.md\nfiles when they are not supposed to, check if you have Prettier set to be your default formatter with\n\"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\nin your user settings.\nAdditionally, consider using the\nGlob Pattern\nin the extension settings to specify which files to prettify automatically.\nAdditional tips\nFor additional tips, such as how to replace strings in files, refer to the\npractical handbook edits examples\n.\nNeed help?\nTeam members, referred to as\nMR Buddies\nMR Buddies playlist\n.

If the username you wish to use is unavailable, you will have to pick a different one.\nSTEP 2: Create a new account with your new username\nIf support replies to you telling that the username is free to use, create a new GitLab.com account with it.\nUse a personal email to register your new account and choose one that has not been used with your old GitLab account.\nNavigate to your\nProfile Settings\n>\nEmails\n, and add a new email.\n‚≠êÔ∏è\nTrick\n‚≠êÔ∏è If your email at GitLab is\nmary@gitlab.com\n, add the new email as\nmary+something@gitlab.com\n: this is a\nGmail trick\n! All your emails sent to this alias will end up in your GitLab email account üòÉ\nNavigate to\nhttps://gitlab.com/-/profile/notifications\nand choose the notifications email:\nmary+something@gitlab.com\n.\nOpen your old account in one browser and the new one in another browser (e.g., Chrome and Firefox, or Chrome and Safari) - log in to both accounts at the same time.\nSTEP 3: Let‚Äôs have some fun (kidding, this is critical!)\nNavigate to\nhttps://gitlab.com/-/profile/account\nin both your accounts.\nLook for your username.\nThis operation has to be done quickly, otherwise you are risking to lose your awesome new username to someone else quicker than you.\nWe need to\nswap\nthe usernames between both accounts, so you‚Äôll keep all your history, your privileges, issues, and MRs assigned to you, etc.\nIf you work with 2 monitors, open each browser on one monitor.\nIf you don‚Äôt, open them side by side, so that you can keep an eye on both at the same time.\nRename your new username\nmary\nto something like\nmary-1\nand\nclick\nupdate username\nyet.\nRename your old username\nold-mary\nto your new username\nmary\nand\nupdate that either.\nJust leave them typed into the boxes.\nMake sure you did the previous step right!\n‚ö†Ô∏è\n‚ö†Ô∏è Update the first one (\nmary\nto\nmary-1\n).\nImmediately, click\nupdate\non the other one (\nold-mary\nto\nmary\n).\nImmediately, rename the\nmary-1\nto your old one\nold-mary\nand click\nupdate username\nagain.\nTa-Da! üôå\nSTEP 4: Move your projects (or not)\nNow, if you have any personal projects, you might want to import them to your new account (the one that has your old username now).\nTo do that, in your new account (the one with the old username), click\nCreate a New Project\n, give it the very same name as the original one, click\nGit - add repo by url\n, and paste the\nhttps://\nURL of your project there.\nTo make things easier, make sure all the projects you want to import are set to\npublic\nview.\nYou can make them private afterwards.\nIf you have GitLab Pages projects with the default\nGitLab.io\nurl, you will need to import them to you new account, then make a change to\ntrigger a build\nand redeploy your site.\nThey will be affected only if you‚Äôre using a\nCNAME with a subdomain instead of an A record\n.\nThis won‚Äôt affect Pages projects that use custom domains, as they all point to the same Pages server IP via\nrecord.\nYour groups won‚Äôt be affected either, as they operate under their own namespace.\nAdd both users as members of your groups and nothing changes.\nThat‚Äôs it!\nSTEP 5: Update your username in other places\nDon‚Äôt forget to update your username in the following places:\nteam page\nIf you‚Äôre part of Marketing,\nMarketing Handbook\nWorkday - GitLab Username under ‚ÄòAdditional Data‚Äô > ‚ÄòView all‚Äô in your profile actions\nSTEP 6: Set up your notifications\nTeam members choose to manage their GitLab activities in different ways. Setup your notifications in a way that works best for you.\nTo-do list:\nall team members will see a\nto-do list\nwithin their GitLab account. This will track different action items. Items can be marked as done as they are completed.\nEmail:\nteam members can choose which, if any, notifications show up in their Gmail accounts by\nusing filters\n.\nSlack notifications:\nteam members can choose to enable\nSlack notifications\n. Please note that GitLab slack expires after 90 days, so this is not a tool for longer-term activity management.\nGitLab team members‚Äô resources\nThe\nGitLab team-member resources project\nhas a wiki for sharing among\nGitLab team-members\n.\nIt‚Äôs for topics like parenting where people may want to share knowledge, but the handbook is not the best fit.\nGitLab team members‚Äô setups\n@tipyn\n‚Äôs\nhome office equipment and macOS setup\nLinking Gravatar photo\nLink your GitLab email address to an easily recognizable photo of yourself on GitLab, Slack, and\nGravatar\n.\nIt is company policy to use a photo, and not an avatar, a stock photo, or something with sunglasses for any of your GitLab accounts, as we have a lot of GitLab team-members and our brains are comfortable with recognizing people; let‚Äôs use them.\nNote\n: If you upload your photo to Gravatar associated with your gitlab.com email, then you can simply not set an image in your GitLab and Slack profiles and they will automatically use your Gravatar photo.¬† If you already uploaded individual photos to your GitLab and Slack profiles, simply removing them will cause your avatar to use the Gravatar photo by default.\nUsing Mermaid\nMermaid is a tool that allows us to create flowcharts, graphs, diagrams, Gantt charts, etc. within GitLab! Check out the\nexamples in the GitLab docs\non how to use Mermaid.\nA few additional resources that can be helpful when working with Mermaid are:\nThe\nlive mermaid editor\nto check your work!\nGitHub‚Äôs Mermaid overview\nCSS color bank\nto add color to your charts.\nYou can see an example of how to add images to Mermaid charts\nhere\n.\nExamples of Mermaid charts that have been created by GitLab team members:\nTalent Development Program Chart\nby\nCassiana Gudgenov\n, People Compliance Partner\nCEO Year at a Glance\nData Infrastructure System Diagram\nAdvanced layout demos\nfor Mermaid diagrams\nthree back tick symbols\nfollowed by the word\nmermaid\nbefore the chart, and\nthree back tick symbols\nat the end of the chart.

For how to edit the handbook in your browser, refer to\nthe editing handbook page\n.\nwww-gitlab-com Tips\nPortions of the\nhttps://about.gitlab.com\nsite lives in the\nwww-gitlab.com\nrepo. The marketing website is maintained by the\ndigital experience team\nin their\nGitLab group\n.\nThe\ndata/*.yml\nfiles live in the\nwww-gitlab-com\nrepository, and are used by numerous sites including the marketing website and the handbook.\nThe documentation for the site itself is in markdown documents under the\ndoc\nfolder in the repo\n. If you are looking to do local development on the site,\ndoc/development.md\nis probably the best place to start.\nImage and GIF tips\nMany of the tips shown in this section require ImageMagick, an image manipulation tool. The installation is described in the\nImageMagick section\n.\nImageMagick\nprovides the\nconvert\nCLI command which can be used to resize images, add drop shadows, edit GIFs, etc.\nOn macOS, install ImageMagick with Homebrew:\nbrew install imagemagick\nOn Linux, use your package manager:\nsudo dnf install ImageMagick\nsudo apt install imagemagick\nCreating GIFs\nWe have a\ndedicated section\nfor that in the handbook.\nResizing images\nImageMagick\nprovides the\nconvert\nCLI command which can be used to resize images. Our blog images do not need resolutions higher than 1920x1080. This saves bandwidth and makes the website load faster.\nThis example converts an existing image to\n1920x1080\nresolution and replaces it inline:\nconvert blogimage.jpg -resize 1920x1080 blogimage.jpg\nYou can also use percentage values for the\n-resize\nparameter. The\nconvert\nCLI command can do more things explained in the\ndocumentation\n.\nIf you need to convert multiple images, combine the\nconvert\ncommand with\nfind\n. Note that this replaces the images inline.\nfind . -type f -name\n'*.jpg'\n-exec sh -c\n'convert {} -resize 1920x1080 {}'\n\\;\nConvert HEIC to JPG\nTip: Modern macOS versions provide the Finder right-click menu\nQuick Actions > Convert Image\nwhich automatically converts an image to JPG. Use this method for quick UI conversions.\nImageMagick\nprovides the\nmogrify\nCLI command which can be used to convert the\nimage format to other formats like\nwhich are accepted on all websites.\nmogrify -format jpg icloudphoto.HEIC\nIf you need to convert multiple images, combine the\nmogrify\ncommand with\nfind\n. Note that this creates new files and requires manual cleanup of\nfiles,\n-iname\nuses a case insensitive match.\nfind . -type f -iname\n'*.heic'\n-exec sh -c\n'mogrify -format jpg \\\"{}\\\"'\n\\;\nAn example shell alias can be found in\n@dnsmichi‚Äôs dotfiles project\n.\nAdd drop shadow to images\nInstall ImageMagick\nand use the\nconvert\nCLI command to add a drop shadow. The\n-shadow\nparameter may need adjustments on the dimension.\nconvert input.png\n\\(\n+clone -background black -shadow 80x20+0+15\n\\)\n+swap -background transparent -layers merge +repage output.png\nTroubleshooting\n2FA debugging\nIf 2FA stops working unexpectedly (no new phone or computer) it‚Äôs usually because of improperly configured date & time on either device.\nMake sure that ‚ÄúAutomatic Date & Time‚Äù is\nenabled\non both devices.\nIf they‚Äôre already enabled try toggling them off and on again to force an update.\nIf this doesn‚Äôt work, request that IT Ops reset your 2FA setting.\nLinks for finding the settings:\niOS:\nGet help with the date and time on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support\nmacOS:\nIf the date or time is wrong on your Mac - Apple Support\nLinux (using systemd):\nsystemd-timesyncd - ArchWiki\nFor Android there‚Äôs no definitive link, since most vendors have different UIs for their settings.\nBut in the Settings-app, look for ‚ÄúDate & Time‚Äù and there should be a ‚ÄúAutomatic Date & Time‚Äù toggle.\nCheck which process occupies a given port\nUsing Netstat\nNetstat is a command line tool which can be useful to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc. One of the most common uses for netstat during troubleshooting is to display a list of open ports listening for connections.\n[\nuser@gitlab ~\n]\n$ sudo netstat -tulpn\ngrep -i listen\ntcp\n0\n127.0.0.1:5000     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18948/registry\ntcp\n0\n127.0.0.1:9100     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18841/node_exporter\ntcp\n0\n127.0.0.1:9229     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18764/gitlab-workho\ntcp\n0\n127.0.0.1:8080     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18980/unicorn maste\ntcp\n0\n127.0.0.1:9168     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18808/puma 4.3.3.gi\ntcp\n0\n0.0.0.0:80         0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     18831/nginx: master\nIf you find a port already in use, you won‚Äôt be able to successfully start up a service or program that utilizes that same port.

It is hardware-based, and is typically deployed via a USB, NFC, or built into a device such as a MacBook‚Äôs Touch ID or iPhone‚Äôs Face ID. The standard is open and is maintained by the\nFIDO Alliance\n.\nWebAuthn\nis a component of FIDO2 that supports verification by web applications using public key cryptography. FIDO2/WebAuthn is the preferred method of 2FA and is highly recommended by GitLab‚Äôs Security Department. One of the points of 2FA is that while you are authenticating with a username and password for the first factor, a secondary factor should use a separate - or ‚Äúout of band (OOB)‚Äù - communication channel for the authentication. FIDO2/WebAuthn devices certainly meet that criteria, better than all other methods. There are other 2FA methods\noutlined below\n.\nHow it works\nDuring the authentication process, you enter in your username and your password. On systems with 2FA enabled and using FIDO2/WebAuthn, the hardware token is queried. By pressing a button or tapping a sensor on the FIDO2 device, the FIDO2 device completes the authentication process in a cryptographically strong way. It is generally considered the most secure form of 2FA. It is also more convenient than manually entering codes generated by a\napplication.\nDuring the registration of the FIDO2/WebAuthn device, a public/private key pair is generated, with the public key being registered with the service you will be authenticating with, and the private key is stored on a secure chip in the device. When authenticating, after you‚Äôve entered in your username and password, the device is queried via an encrypted message that can only be authenticated by the private key, so a button or sensor is pressed on the device to allow the query to be completed, and the user is then granted access to the system.\nFIDO2/WebAuthn devices\nYubiKey: The most popular FIDO2/WebAuthn device is Yubico‚Äôs YubiKey. There are a wide variety of sizes and styles of YubiKeys. Yubico (along with Google) helped develop the predecessor to FIDO2 standard (U2F) before it was moved to the FIDO Alliance. Most GitLab team members that have WebAuthn devices have a YubiKey. It should be noted that for a long time Yubico‚Äôs source code for its firmware was open source, but some of the newer versions of firmware are closed source. This has caused some concern in the security community, particularly those that prefer to use open source whenever possible.\nAre They Secure?\nYubiKey has been examined by the security industry at large, third party audits and by the Security Team. YubiKey‚Äôs are more than suitable for use within GitLab and work fine with FIDO2/WebAuthn-compatible systems.\nYubiKey has had a number of\nsecurity issues\nwhich are typically resolved quickly. They have a dedicated page for security advisories.\nIn rare cases, a security issue involving a hardware token arises that requires the hardware token to be replaced as a firmware update will not mitigate the issue. This happened with\nYubico in 2017\n.\nMost of the attack models that impact the FIDO2/WebAuthn tokens require physical access to the token itself. That is, the security advisories involve coding issues that can only be exploited via access to the token or the computer that the token is plugged into. This in itself makes the devices more secure.\nRecommendations\nWhile there are other hardware tokens that are also decent and will function with GitLab, some have limitations. The recommended solution for team members is Yubico‚Äôs YubiKeys.\nPlease fill out this\nform\nbefore ordering a YubiKey, as we may be able to provide a YubiKey via our group buy subscription.\nRecommended YubiKey models include the YubiKey 5Ci (for iPhone users) and YubiKey 5 NFC (for Android users).\nWhat GitLab team members need to keep in mind is that if you travel with your company laptop - either on a business trip, a trip to visit family and friends in another location but you intend to keep working, or just a trip to the local coffee shop - treat the token with the same level of care as a credit card. Do not leave it where it could be stolen.\nIf you are concerned about potentially losing your hardware token, be sure to add\nTouch ID\nand potentially a\nmobile device\nas an accepted authentication token. Sites following the FIDO2/WebAuthn standard should support multiple tokens. That way if one is lost or stolen, you can still login use another method. Currently YubiKey‚Äôs are limited to one per user, in the case of lost or damaged, please reach out in the #it_security_help Slack channel and we‚Äôll assist you with a replacement.\nUsage of 2FA is mandatory for GitLab team members.\nOther 2FA Methods\nIn addition to\nFIDO2/WebAuthn\n, there are additional protocols used for 2FA. There is ‚Äúcryptographic push‚Äù,\n, and SMS-based authentication (text message). Pluses and minuses to each are listed below.\nCryptographic Push\nThis is usually shortened to simply ‚Äúpush technology‚Äù. It is called ‚Äúpush‚Äù because during the authentication process, after you‚Äôve entered your username and password, the service you are authenticating with automatically ‚Äúpushes‚Äù a secondary authentication via a separate communications channel to a device you possess. This is usually your phone, and it is facilitated via a phone app that is specific to that process. During the registration process a cryptographically-secure key pair is generated, and the app uses that key pair to uniquely identify the Push as coming from the service you are authenticating to. Typically the app then either directly notifies you or you access the app, which will pop up a message asking if you were in fact trying to authenticate. Answer yes and the authentication process is complete. GitLab team members may be familiar with this Push method as it is used by\nOkta Verify\n.\nPush Caveats\nThis method is not quite as secure as a hardware token, as typically those devices stores data securely on the secure chip on the device itself. It is possible that the Push phone app is also storing secret data on the local secure chip on the phone, however the entire process is dependent on the service‚Äôs servers being up, and WebAuthn is more self-contained. But note that Push technology is still considered extremely secure, and once configured it is fairly convenient to use.\nTimed-based One-Time Password is fairly secure. This method involves a rotating value based off of a cryptographic seed that is used to uniquely identify communication between the service and the end user authenticating. The value is (usually) a six digit number that changes every 30 seconds, and during the authentication process after you‚Äôve successfully entered in your username and password, you are asked to enter in the value. GitLab team members should use\n1Password\nto manage TOTP codes.\nTOTP Caveats\nThe main problem with TOTP is that during this 2FA process it typically involves the end user entering in all values through a single communications channel (usually a web browser). As this is the case, it is possible that an attacker could send you a fake web page for you to enter in your credentials, including your TOTP value. Granted, the attacker would have to be reading your replies and sending in all of your credential information extremely quickly and get the entire process completed with 30 seconds so the risk is greatly reduced, but it still exists. Both WebAuthn and Push are preferred over TOTP, but as long as you are the one initiating the communication and you are not clicking on a link in email, you should be okay.\nOne of the more popular (and most common) methods of 2FA is SMS-based text messaging. It is similar to TOTP, but instead of using a locally-stored application to calculate the six digit number, the service you are authenticating to sends the six digits to you via an SMS text message. When you set up your account, you provide the service with your cell phone number so they know which phone number to send the six digits to.\nSMS Caveats\nDue to the number of caveats, SMS is only recommended if there is no other 2FA option available. Here are the main problems with SMS messaging.\nSMS is subject to the same phish-style attack as TOTP. The main difference is that some SMS-based authentication schemes time out after 60 seconds instead of 30, making the phish-style attack slightly easier for the attacker.\nThe information regarding your phone number is stored on a SIM card in your phone. If an attacker with physical access to your phone were to steal the SIM, they could impersonate you from their own phone. Of course they could do the same thing with your hardware token, however they would still need your username and password to use the hardware token. Unfortunately, calling up the service and asking for your password to be reset is often confirmed using SMS messaging, so with the possession of the SIM card, the attacker could pose as you. Again, if you treat your phone the same way you treat your credit card or cash, then this type of attack is minimized.\nAn attacker could contact your phone carrier, impersonate you and state you lost your phone, and set up a new SIM card. Unfortunately many times your account is protected with a security question such as ‚Äúmother‚Äôs maiden name‚Äù, ‚Äúfavorite restaurant‚Äù, or some other simple question - all information that could be determined from a website that does family trees or via social media where you post pictures of your dinner.\nAn older attack known as ‚Äú\nSIMJacker\n‚Äù allowed an attacker to send your phone an SMS message with a malicious payload that allows for direct manipulation of the SIM card itself. This attack still works on older SIM cards, although more modern SIMs are no longer vulnerable to this. Most of the known attacks using SIMJacker involved Latin and South America, the Middle East, Northern Africa, parts of Eastern Europe, and parts of Southeast Asia.\nIf You Must Use SMS\nThere may be services that only offer SMS as their 2FA solution, so in those cases it is better than nothing. If this is the case, there are a few things you can do to secure things ever so slightly.\nIf you have an old phone (5+ years old) you might want to consider upgrading the SIM to a recent one, as these are not susceptible to the SIMJacker issues.\nContact your phone carrier and ask if there are additional security measures to protect your account besides security questions, such as a PIN. In lieu of that, you could also try setting your mother‚Äôs maiden name or family pet security questions to something more, shall we say, unique (e.g.\nHdyla86kajDF64asdlui\n).\nSet a SIM PIN. For iOS devices, follow these\ninstructions from Apple\n. For Android devices, start with\nthese instructions\nbut contact your phone‚Äôs manufacturer website if the instructions do not fit your particular model.\nComplain to the service to offer more than just SMS for 2FA! The more complaints they get, the more likely they might be to offer more secure options.\nAdditional 2FA Concerns\nRemember the purpose of 2FA - it is a secondary authentication method, invoked after the primary authentication method has succeeded. You should only acknowledge a 2FA request if you personally have just successfully completed the primary authentication. An unsolicited 2FA request means someone has your password, and is in the process of trying to log in as you. This is why 2FA exists, to help protect your user account from attacks involving your password.\nIf you experience any such irregularities, please bring it to the attention of the Security Team.

Use this setting if it‚Äôs helpful for you to see declined meetings in your calendar view for any other reason.\nNavigate to\nEvent settings\nCheck the box for ‚ÄòShow declined events‚Äô under ‚ÄòView options‚Äô\nSharing\nWe recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to ‚ÄòMake available for GitLab - See all event details‚Äô. Team member calendars should\nnot\nhave access permissions set to ‚ÄòMake available to public‚Äô due to the risk of sensitive data exposure and\nzoombombing\n.\nConsider marking the following appointments as ‚ÄòPrivate‚Äô:\nPersonal appointments\nConfidential & sensitive meetings with third-parties outside of GitLab\n1-1 performance or evaluation meetings\nMeetings on organizational changes\nThere are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone at GitLab:\nTransparency is one of our values and sharing what you work on is in line with our message of ‚Äúbe open about as many things as possible‚Äù.\nDue to our timezone differences, there are small windows of time when our availabilities overlap.\nIf other members need to schedule a new meeting, seeing the details of recurring meetings (such as 1-1s) will allow for more flexibility in scheduling without needing to wait for a confirmation from the team member.\nThis speaks to our value to be more efficient.\nWhen setting up your Google Calendar be sure to\nset your working hours\n.\nIf you‚Äôd like to share your calendar with e.g. your partner you can use the ‚ÄòShare with specific people‚Äô feature and set the permissions to ‚ÄòSee only free/busy (hide details)‚Äô:\nSpeedy meetings\nEnable speedy meetings to automatically provide a buffer at the end of events you schedule.\nThis thoughtfully allows participants with back-to-back events the opportunity to use the restroom or grab a cup of coffee without being late to their next function.\nWorld clock\nAdd as many time zone world clocks as you wish by, in Google Calendar, going to\nSettings -> World Clock\nin order to see team members‚Äô local times.\nYou can also use sites like\nTimeAndDate\nto convert times to/from UTC for example.\nTime zone\nCheck\nDisplay secondary time zone\nand select\n(GMT+00:00) Coordinated Universal Time\n(UTC). This enables team members to standardize on a single time zone in communicating when meetings take place.\nGoogle Cloud Platform\nSee the\nSandbox Cloud page\nfor a listing of cloud resources and how to gain access to them.\nGoogle Drive\nFirst, an important message - Don‚Äôt use Google Drive/Apps (unless you have to)\nWe would be remiss if we didn‚Äôt start this section off with this IMPORTANT message:\nYour default storage place for information that needs to persist and be available to others in the company should be ON THE WEBSITE/IN THE COMPANY HANDBOOK and not in Google Drive and Google Apps files!!\nThis is from the top.\nThis is how we operate, because Google Docs/Apps can only be found and contributed to by team members, and not by users, customers, advocates, future employees, Google handbook searches, or developers.\nDo not link directly to Google Drive/Apps\nHaving said that, there is content which doesn‚Äôt make sense to be created on the website directly (e.g. large collections of data in tables, spreadsheets for calculations, etc) or for which Google Drive storage makes sense.\nWhen directing folks to these files in Google Drive please include name of the file in the handbook so that team members can search for it in Google Drive. If you link directly to the URL, people from outside the organization can request access, creating workload and the potential for mistakes.\nKeeping it organized\nIt is important that we not just throw files into random or general places in the shared Google Drives.\nDoing so makes it harder for others to find and work with the content.\nHere are some guidelines to organizing the Google Drive content:\nFirst by department (e.g. strategic marketing)\nthen by subject (e.g. analysts relations)\nthen by sub-subjects as deep as necessary (e.g. Gartner -> 2018 ARO MQ)\nUsing Google Drive\nFor starters, when your GitLab Google company account is created you automatically get a Google Drive with unlimited storage allocation in your own ‚Äúhome‚Äù directory (called My Drive).\nYou can get to it by:\n(optional) Login to your GitLab account in your browser (if you are using Chrome)\nOpen your web browser to\nhttps://drive.google.com\nIf you‚Äôre not already logged in as your GitLab account (Chrome users should be) then login to Google using your GitLab account\nThis will take you to your Google Drive (called My Drive) which is like your home directory.\nIf you create Google files using Google Apps and don‚Äôt specify where to store them, they will be put in this home directory.\nThis is great for storing your own working files.\nAs already stated,\nthis should never be the final resting place for shared files\nthat are meant to be used by the rest of the company (or beyond).\nExisting GitLab Google Drive repositories\nThere are a few Google Drive repositories of GitLab shared files (there might be more, please add if not listed here):\nUX Research Drive\n- This houses all findings from\nCustomer Discovery Meetings\nand raw, confidential materials from customers shared with Design, UX Research, Product and Customer Success. Distilled findings from\nUser Research\nare stored in the\nUXR_Insights repository\n.\nGitLab Marketing Drive\n- This houses all shared files from the entire Marketing organization.\nThe best practice is for sub-organizations to have their own directory inside this space (e.g.\nStrategic Marketing\n).\nSales Drive\n- This houses all the shared files from the Sales organization.\nThe best practice is for some sub-organizations to have their own directory inside this space (e.g.\nCustomer Success\n).\nGitLab Alliance Drive\n- This houses all shared files from the entire Alliance organization.\nThe best practice is for sub-organizations to have their own directory inside this space (e.g.\nPartner Discussions\n).\nHow do you use these? You don‚Äôt have to remember these URL‚Äôs.\nTo add these links to your Google Drive My Drive directory, do the following:\nMake sure you are logged into your GitLab account in Google Drive in your browser\nOpen the link of interest (from above) to go to that directory\nFind the directory path across the top (under the ‚ÄúSearch Drive‚Äù field)\nFind the name of directory in that path that you want to add to your drive (e.g. Sales)\nClick on the down arrow next to it\nFrom the resulting pop-up menu, select ‚ÄúAdd to My Drive‚Äù\nFrom now on you can get to that directory by first going to your drive (\nhttps://drive.google.com\n) and then opening that link\nAdding Google Drive to your Mac\nTo really make your Google Drive easier to access, you can have your Google Drive show up on your Mac Finder as a regular drive.\nWith this it is easier to store and view files such as videos, analyst reports (PDFs), etc.\nHere‚Äôs how to do this:\nMake sure you are logged into your GitLab account in Google Drive in your browser\nGo to your Google Drive (\nhttps://drive.google.com\n)\nClick on the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù icon (Gear) to the right of the search field\nFrom the resulting menu, select ‚ÄúGet Drive for desktop‚Äù\nIt might pull up a new page/tab and use your personal login.\nIf it does this you won‚Äôt see ‚ÄúDownload & install Drive for desktop‚Äù on the page.\nSwitch to your GitLab account.\nDownload and install\nGoogle Forms\nUse these\nGitLab branded form templates\nwhen creating internal or external surveys or forms.\nMake a copy of the form and only edit the copy; do not edit the template itself.\nReview\nwhat data privacy means at GitLab\n. Help participants make informed decisions by applying the following guidelines:\nFor external forms\n: State that any Personal Data collected will be processed in accordance with the\nGitLab Privacy Statement\n.\nFor internal forms\n: Ensure that the purpose for collecting data is stated under our\nTeam Member Privacy Policy\nand that this purpose is made clear to Team Members.\nDon‚Äôt make Personal Data form fields mandatory unless they‚Äôre absolutely necessary to achieve the processing; any inessential Personal Data collected should be through a voluntary form field.\nOnly process Personal Data for the reason in which it was initially collected e.g., if the Google Form collected traveler information, don‚Äôt then use that Personal Data to create a marketing list.\nGoogle Mail (Gmail)\nAuto-advance\nIf you use the archive function, you normally return to your overview.\nWith Auto-advance you can select whether to advance to the next or previous message.\n‚ÄúAuto-advance‚Äù can be enabled from the Advanced section under Settings.\nThis reveals the Auto-advance settings in the General section under Settings.\nThe default setting of showing the previous (older) message is usually preferred.\nEmail signature\n-Set up an\nemail signature\nwhich includes your full name and job title so people can quickly know who you are and what you do.\n-It is also an option to add your\npersonal pronouns\nto your email signature.\nExample\nNote: You can copy and paste the template below to use it in your own signature.\nAlex Doe (they/them)\nEmail signature if employed by our German entity\nDuring onboarding you may have been asked to set up your GitLab Gmail and your email signature using the\nfollowing example as a guideline\n.

{"doc_id": "568682b6b311a9e5", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo", "title": "CEO | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nThis page details processes specific to Bill Staples, CEO of GitLab.\nWhy I‚Äôm at GitLab\nI love software. I love developers. In my lifetime, I‚Äôve seen software change every aspect of modern life. I believe we‚Äôre still in the early stages of software transformation, and AI will accelerate how software changes the human experience in the coming decade. There has never been a better time in history to be in the software business and serving developers. GitLab is a strategic asset for the companies we serve because we provide the platform they use to create software experiences for their customers. As we serve developers and improve their work and lives, our positive impact is amplified through them, ultimately reaching billions of people around the world in profound ways.\nI am honored to lead GitLab as CEO. It is the climax of my career after nearly 30 years of serving developers. I am committed to maximizing our impact in service of customers, shareholders, and team members. I am competitive, and I want to win. Winning begins with delivering software to our customers, creating positive results they can‚Äôt get any other way, and continuing to do that in a rapidly expanding and evolving market. That means innovation. It also means driving results for customers as our first priority. It means continuing to focus on responsible growth and performing in an elite class, one of the very few who are the very best in the world for the categories we compete in.\nThis README is meant to help anyone who needs to work with me by providing a brief overview of what is important to me.\nMy Personal Values\nIntegrity:\nTrust is the most important thing in any relationship. Trust is knowing you can count on me to say what I mean and do what I say. I try to live my life in strict adherence to this value, and when I fall short, I try to proactively and openly acknowledge and recommit. My single biggest ‚Äòhot button‚Äô issue is when someone does not follow through on something they said they would do.\nCurious:\nI try to live what many call the ‚Äúgrowth mindset,‚Äù which means that I‚Äôm always learning, striving to improve, and iterating to be better. I feel very imperfect and self-critical on the inside, and I constantly strive to learn as much as I can while appreciating that I can‚Äôt know it all. I‚Äôm open and accept constructive feedback from anyone, anytime.\nResults:\nGood ideas, hard work, and fun on the job are all important, but ultimately, our results are what matters. I care far more about outcomes than effort. I strive to do everything at a high standard of excellence, and I‚Äôm never satisfied with the status quo. I seek people who are equally committed to being world-class.\nMy Super Powers - how you can get the best from me\nPassionate\n- I work for causes and missions and pour my heart into them. My brain is highly analytical, detail-oriented, and (usually) pretty fast, but my heart is equally important to understand me: I feel things deeply and try to help others around me both see the possibilities and feel motivated and inspired to strive toward what others may not think possible.  I am passionate about my work. It is not just a job for me. It is where I find meaning, purpose, value, and how I contribute to the world.\nCuriosity\n- I ask a lot of questions and like to absorb information quickly. I like being surrounded by people I can learn from and collaborate with. I often see patterns and synthesize disparate points of information to help others make sense of the work and align on a direction.\nWork Ethic\n- From my early life, I have always worked very hard and enjoyed it (most of the time). I especially enjoy ‚Äúthe struggle,‚Äù solving complex problems, grinding on hard issues, and rising above roadblocks. George Bernard Shaw once wrote, ‚ÄúI want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live.‚Äù\nMy Weaknesses - double-edged swords are real\nPassionate\n‚Äî I sometimes come across as emotionally charged, overly critical when we fall short of goals, or emotional when something touches my heart. I don‚Äôt smile enough on the outside (even though I‚Äôm generally pretty happy on the inside‚Äîbecause solving problems is fun to me!).\nHow to help me manage this: It depends on the situation. There is a time to be serious, but it is also possible to overdo it. Try smiling to remind me that I can lighten the mood. A well-timed joke is always helpful, and feel free to ask with a smile, ‚ÄúAre we having fun yet?‚Äù to make me think.\nCuriosity\n- I sometimes exhaust people with my many questions and drill-in tendencies. As I‚Äôm a genuinely curious person and care about all parts of the business,  I regularly do this, and it is not always an indication that something is off.\nHow to help me manage this: Come prepared for meetings. If you don‚Äôt know the answer, let me know and be clear on when you will follow up. If you have concerns about whether my drilling affects your performance, let me know so we can discuss it.\nWork Ethic\n- Occasionally, people struggle to keep pace with my style of work.\nHow to help me manage this: let me know if you are struggling so we can discuss it.\nSuggestion: If I am negatively impacting you, I welcome constructive feedback and will do my best to moderate my approach.\nMy Expectations of Everyone (including myself)\nCollaborate\n- By default, I expect everyone to actively work with their teams, peers, and leaders, as well as customers, partners, and investors (as applicable), to identify the ‚Äúabsolute best‚Äù ideas, no matter where they come from. I hire and retain leaders who I believe are experts in their functions and whom I feel personally excited to work with and learn from. Still, I also believe the best leaders actively learn from and incorporate good ideas from everywhere. I expect E-Group members to have similarly high expectations for team members.\nAccountability\n- By default, you are trusted to do your job, and I believe part of everyone‚Äôs job is to communicate expectations, set metrics and targets, and meet them. Along the way, the single most powerful way to ensure expectations are managed and met is to discuss or ‚Äúinspect‚Äù the work regularly. This powerful tool\ndoes not\nrepresent a lack of trust or micromanagement; when done right, it ensures the best ideas are being pursued, surprises and roadblocks are rapidly identified and removed, and outcomes are maximized. I like creating operating rhythms that enable automated inspection and collaboration opportunities for every mission-critical initiative on a regular basis.\nSelfless\n‚Äî The very best leaders I know are smart and driven, and they motivate and inspire others to do their best work. Careful observation of these leaders also reveals that they check their egos at the door and focus on what is best for the company and customers first. They serve others around them and act selflessly for the greater good.\nMy Role\nI am the CEO of GitLab. Here is what I do in 12 words or less that is unique to my role:\nLead the team that defines and drives GitLab‚Äôs strategy & execution.\nCommunication Preferences\nI prefer Slack to email. I try to respond to every Slack message I get every day. Keep them concise.\nIf you need me in near real-time, text or call my phone. My EBA can help to get you in touch if you don‚Äôt have this information and it is urgent.\nIf you have a complex question or need a discussion on something async that will require more than a few sentences for me to reply, put it into a document and share it with me with comments. I read fast and am pretty efficient at giving feedback this way.\nUse email when it is an external-facing communication, but don‚Äôt expect me to respond in < 1 week unless you ask me to look at it sooner over Slack or it is regarding a critical external matter.\nExpectations for leadership\nWhat I need from you. What you will get from me.\nIf you tell me you will do something, I expect you to do it to the very best of your ability on time. I will, too.\nIf you fail at something, I expect you to own it and not make excuses. I will, too.\nIf you succeed at something, I expect you to give all the credit to your team. I will, too.\nI want to be part of a world-class company that is respected for being ‚Äòexcellent‚Äô and unrivaled in our category. I expect you to constantly strive to increase your team‚Äôs output quality and volume through greater alignment and efficiency. I can‚Äôt judge your personal or team capacity, so I will push work until you set my expectations on what is achievable and by when. I expect you to actively manage expectations and hold yourself accountable.\nWhen E-Group members disagree with each other, I expect them to jointly escalate it to me in a timely fashion so I can help break the tie. I have a similar expectation for other team members. Escalation is not a failure. I want a team that is pushing passionately, and it is normal to have conflict. Disagree, commit, and advocate. Be a gracious winner. Own decisions either way 100% with your team.\nFrequently asked questions from prior roles\nWhy do you ask so many questions? What are you looking for?\nI do like to ask a lot of questions.\nI care about the details, and I really like to learn.\nI can tell when someone really knows the area by how easily and completely they can answer my questions.\nWhen I see that someone understands their area very well and has confidence in their area, I shift from probing to generative questions and sometimes ideas with the intention of contributing.\nWhen I see that someone lacks command of their area, I shift to the Socratic method to understand shared beliefs and assumptions and help guide people/teams to an answer we can align on. If this fails or isn‚Äôt converging, I put forward my hypothesis/ideas as a starting point.\nIf you find meetings/discussions ending frequently with my hypothesis as the next step, that may be a sign that we aren‚Äôt well aligned. If in doubt, ask me!\nWhy do you want to inspect my work so frequently? Do you not trust me?\nI like to meet regularly (weekly) to talk about top priorities and our progress on key metrics. These meetings normally have nothing to do with trust.\nPast experience has taught me that monthly updates are not frequent enough to ensure that most bold, ambitious, impactful initiatives are delivered as efficiently as possible, on time, and with high quality. It truly ‚Äòtakes a village‚Äô to make that happen.\nOperating meetings help me learn the realities of the work, stay in touch with real roadblocks and challenges that sometimes only I can resolve, contribute ideas, and help align functions across the company to ensure that we meet our most important goals.\nYou seem to work a lot of hours and around the clock. Do you expect the same from me?\nNo\nI expect you to manage your own work/life balance; no one else can do it for you. Everyone‚Äôs needs are unique, so managers can‚Äôt really prescribe how to achieve a balance that is right for you.\nManagers should measure whether their reports‚Äô work meets business needs and tell them if they see misalignment. This is part of my job as manager of E-Group.\nWork is by nature a competitive task, and there will always be someone smarter, who works harder or is more skilled than oneself. Some jobs are more complicated and demand more than others. In some periods of life, one may have more or less to give than others. Finding balance is difficult and requires constant management. My advice: Be honest with yourself about who you are and what you need, then give it your best and keep an open dialogue with your manager. Good managers care about and flex with the people they manage to find a win/win for the company and individual.\nCan you share a bit more about your personal life? What do you do outside of work?\nMy family is my #1 priority in life, and I give extreme attention to their needs. My sons are both out of the house on their own, leaving just my wife and me at home. They support me in giving my best to GitLab.\nI really do enjoy work. I‚Äôve had the fortune to take some extended time off in my career, and every time I do, I am reminded that work is so much more than a paycheck. It is something I love and how I find purpose.\nWhen I have free time, my #1 hobby is cycling with my wife. We have cycled in different parts of the world and always strive to see new places by bike.\nI often couple my #2 hobby, photography, with my work and personal travel. I love taking photos because it encourages me to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the world in non-obvious ways to create interesting photos, which is also helpful in life and business. I like the blend of science and art skills that photography demands.\nCEO Scam\nSee\nCEO and executive fraud\nin the security practices section of the handbook.\nMeeting request requirements\nFor scheduling a video call or meeting with me or other execs, please see the\nEBA handbook page\n.\nCEO Meeting Cadence\nAs part of my role, I participate in a variety of meetings both internal and external.\nMonthly Meetings\nMonthly CEO AMA,\nagenda in Gdrive\n(internal).\nCEO Shadow Program\nAt GitLab, being a CEO Shadow is not a job title, but a temporary assignment to shadow the CEO\nOffice of the CEO\nDetails about Office of the CEO (OCEO) at GitLab\nLast modified April 9, 2025:\nFixed a minor spelling error (\ne34fa8a4\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 2384}
{"doc_id": "2fe0b0b900d792cb", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership", "title": "Leadership | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nLeadership\nThis page contains leadership pointers.\nThe first couple of headers indicate which group they apply to, using the groupings\ndefined on our\nteam structure page\n.\nManagers of One\nIn an all-remote organization, we want each team member to be a\nmanager of one\nis an attribute associated with our\nEfficiency value\n. To be successful at GitLab, team members need to develop their daily priorities to achieve goals. Managers of one set the tone for their work, assign items and determine what needs to get done. No matter what role you serve, self-leadership is an essential skill needed to be successful as a manager of one.\nAt GitLab, leadership is requested from everyone, whether an individual contributor or member of the leadership team.\nAs a leader, GitLab team members will follow your behavior, so always do the right thing. Lead by example with effort.\nEveryone who joins GitLab should consider themselves ambassadors of our\nvalues\nand protectors of our\nculture\n.\nBehavior should be consistent inside and outside the company. We do the right thing outside the company, too.\nGitLab respects your judgment of what is best for you, since you know yourself best. If you have a better opportunity somewhere else don‚Äôt stay at GitLab out of a sense of loyalty to the company.\nIn tough times people will put in their best effort when they are doing it for each other.\nWe work\nasynchronously\n. Lead by example and make sure people understand that\nthings need to be written down in issues as they happen\n. Hold your team accountable with documentation.\nWe are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions, but in the end\none person decides\nthe matter after they have listened to all the feedback.\nIt is encouraged to disagree and have constructive debates but please\nargue intelligently\n.\nWe value truth seeking over cohesion.\nWe avoid\nmeetings\n, when possible, because they don‚Äôt support the asynchronous work flow and are hard to conduct due to timezone differences.\nStart meetings on time, be on time yourself, don‚Äôt ask if everyone is there, and don‚Äôt punish people that have shown up on time by waiting for people or repeating things for those that come late. When a meeting unblocks a process or decision, don‚Äôt celebrate that but instead address the question: How can we unblock in the future without needing a meeting?\nBe intentional in how you prepare for and participate in meetings. Async communication works best when folks\nreview their calendars and prepare in advance of meetings\n.\nWe give\nfeedback\n, lots of it. Don‚Äôt hold back on suggestions for improvements, this helps us grow. Take pride in helping others through feedback.\nFocus on improvement\n. If you meet external people, always ask what they think we should improve.\nFollowing from\nPaul Graham‚Äôs advice\n: Strive to make the organization simpler.\nSaying something to the effect of ‚Äúas you might have heard‚Äù, ‚Äúunless you‚Äôve been living in a cage you know‚Äù, ‚Äúas everyone knows‚Äù, or ‚Äúas you might know‚Äù is toxic. The people that know don‚Äôt need it to be said. The people that don‚Äôt know feel like they missed something and might be afraid to ask about the context.\nDon‚Äôt use someone else‚Äôs name\n, remind people of your title, or otherwise\n‚Äúpull rank‚Äù\nto get things done.\nAct as a CEO of yourself and your role by taking responsibility to set goals and appropriate timelines. Prioritize your contributions and know it‚Äôs\nimpossible to know everything\n.\nCommunicate clearly with your team and people leader on the status of your goals. Act quickly to address areas that pose a challenge or to reassess goals that cannot be reached in an alloted timeframe.\nExamples of actions from managers of one at GitLab\nWhen asked to attend a synchronous brainstorming call, a team member instead opens an issue and\nrequests for their team‚Äôs ideas asynchronously\n.\nA people leader champions our value of\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\nby\nbecoming a mentor\n.\nA team member blocks out dedicated time for learning and development to implement a regular practice of\nself-serving and self-learning\n.\nA team member in a new role finds an inefficiency in a process they are learning. Without being asked or supervised, they open a merge request (MR) proposing a change and assign it to their manager for review.\nWhen a scheduled meeting agenda is complete 10 minutes before the call is set to end, an attendee ends the call early.\nA people leader hires a new team member that demonstrates our\nCREDIT values\n.\nBefore asking for others‚Äô time to discuss a topic, they dedicate time to process their thoughts and\nmake a proposal\n.\nA manager of one prioritizes well-being by blocking their calendars for fitness, meals,\npaid time off\n, and personal appointments.\nA team member surfaces blockers as opposed to assuming their manager or team is already aware, and simultaneously works to unblock others by\nworking in public\nand with a\nlow level of shame\n.\nInterim and Acting Leadership\nIn some cases, a individual in the\nManagement group\n,\nDirector group\n,\nS-group\n, or even\nE-group\nmay have an ‚ÄúInterim‚Äù or ‚ÄúActing‚Äù title.\nActing\nmeans that someone is occupying this role temporarily and will move back to their original role after a set amount of time or other conditions, such as an external hire.\nInterim\nmeans the individual is working on a promotion into the role.\nIn either case, they will be fulfilling the full responsibilities of the role. If you have any questions, about the future of the role, please ask them or their manager.\nIndividual departments will have their own criteria for who is eligible to occupy these roles, so please check the career development page for your department.\nMaking decisions\nPlease see the\nMaking Decisions\nLeadership page.\nCommunication should be direct, not hierarchical\nMost companies communicate from top to bottom through a chain of command. This communication flow often empowers managers, but it also introduces inefficiency as team members are not able to connect directly with the people they need to communicate with in order to get their work done. At GitLab, every team member is encouraged to reach out to whoever is the correct person (or people) to quickly unblock issues, solve problems or support in other ways. Do be courteous of your direct manager and copy them on the request. We don‚Äôt encourage unnecessary friction in asking team members to escalate through managers and wait for responses to come back. What matters is efficiency in getting to results. Slack the CEO, Slack a VP, or Slack a peer. Do what you need to do to make GitLab successful.\nManagers should not be bottlenecks or silos for communication.\nAnyone should feel\ncomfortable\nreaching out to anyone else with the best information they can to solve a problem.\nThis is a more\nefficient\n,\ntransparent\n, and\ncollaborative\nway to work.\nGiving Feedback\nGiving regular\nfeedback\nis extremely important for both managers and team members. Feedback can take the form of coaching sessions, separate from\n1-to-1 meetings\n. Giving feedback is also about being prepared and, depending on the situation, you should create separate agendas and structure them as follows:\nProvide\ncontext\n.\nUse a framework for your feedback. Our recommended framework is\nCrucial Conversations\n‚Äì we offer\na training course\n, and the book is part of our\nrecommended reading for leaders\n.\nAsk yourself, is this:\nActionable\nSpecific\nKind\n(Does the feedback help the person? Note: Being kind is not the same as being nice.)\nObjective (similar to Fair)\nRelevant to the job role and\ncompa ratio\nIdentifying root causes\nSometimes when performance dips, the best way to tackle it is to try to determine the root cause. This is easier said than done. There is a great tool that\nCEB (now Gartner)\ncreated to help with this called\nperformance issue root cause diagnostic\n. It may not always be possible or appropriate to determine the root cause, so the\nunderperformance process\nshould be followed.\nResponding to Negative Feedback\nAs a leader, the way you respond to negative\nfeedback\nmakes a significant impact\non your team. Remember that it can be difficult for people to approach someone\nin authority with concerns and respond with sensitivity and appreciation. In particular, we\nrecommend that you keep the following in mind:\nDon‚Äôt argue or get defensive. Accept the feedback for what it is: an attempt\nto help you improve your work or your professional relationships. If you do\nhave to explain yourself, try to remain empathetic.\nIt‚Äôs fine (even preferable) to defer action. When presented with negative\nfeedback, we often feel like we have to either justify our actions or promise\nchange, and since change isn‚Äôt always easy when you‚Äôre responsible for a\nlarge team, justification becomes the default. It‚Äôs OK to say you need time to\nevaluate the feedback and decide how to proceed.\nThe Right Way to Respond to Negative Feedback\nIf a team member from your department or another part of the org comes to you and says they do not feel like they or their reports‚Äô contributions are valued by your reports, the manager should try to resolve this. Research shows that this is more likely to happen to underrepresented minorities. Please note that\nDRIs are free to ignore feedback\nwithout acknowledging it and that\nvaluing contributions isn‚Äôt the same as agreeing with them\n. This is about co-opting someone else‚Äôs idea without attribution and/or dismissing an idea with an ad-hominem remark.\n1-to-1\nPlease see\n1-1\n.\nSkip level interactions\nPlease see\nskip-levels\n.\nYour Individual README\nA team member‚Äôs README page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with them, especially people who haven‚Äôt worked with them before. It‚Äôs also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share your ideas of a good working relationship, to reduce the anxiety of people who may be on your team, now or in the future.\nREADMEs provide a genuine report on how a person works, reducing bias/assumption and enabling people to work together based on a common framework. As part of GitLab‚Äôs\ntransparency\nvalue, we encourage each GitLab team member to consider creating their own README.\nREADMEs by Division\nGitLab division README pages are linked below for context. Reading other READMEs is an important way to get ideas on what you can include in yours. Let these serve as a guide and inspiration to you.\nEngineering READMEs\nMarketing Team READMEs\nProduct READMEs\nUX Department READMEs\nSales Team READMEs\nPeople Group READMEs\nFinance Team READMEs\nLegal Team READMEs\nOffice of the CEO READMEs\nCreating Your README\nCopy the\nREADME-template\nand paste into your favorite Markdown editor. If you do not have a Markdown editor,\nTypora\nand\nBear\nare recommended.\nFill out the recommended sections. Note that each section is\noptional\n. You can remove those you aren‚Äôt comfortable filling out, and add sections that are interesting or important to you.\nOnce complete, you‚Äôll need to\ncreate an issue\nwith the Digital Experience team to add a page to GitLab‚Äôs website.\nIf your\ndivision\nalready\nhas a page to host READMEs (see above), follow the guidelines to\nadd a new page\nwithin that directory (e.g.\nDarren M.\n, a member of the marketing team, would add a new directory and page within\n/handbook/marketing/readmes\n, creating\n/handbook/marketing/readmes/dmurph\n)\nIf your\ndivision\ndoes not yet have a holding page for READMEs, follow the guidelines to\nadd a new page\n(\nreadmes\n) within your division‚Äôs handbook section\nfirst\n, then create your username directory within\nreadmes\n.\nBonus points if you add your README & yourselves as codeowner to the\n.gitlab/CODEOWNERS\nfile.\nAlternatively you can create your README\ndogfooding\nGitLab‚Äôs README profile customization feature. Follow\ndocumentation\non how to add details to your GitLab profile with a README. Do not forget to add your profile‚Äôs link to you division‚Äôs holding page.\nAdvertising Your README\nOnce your README is created, consider adding a link to it from following places:\nGoogle Doc agendas or calendar invites\nYour GitLab.com profile\nYour Slack profile\nYour Email signature\nThis provides maximum visibility to others, so that they may read your README in advance of working with you. This allows them to take your working style and communication preferences into account, ideally increasing the overall level of empathy expressed.\nREADMEs are particularly powerful when working with those\noutside\nof GitLab, who may be unfamiliar with our\nvalues\n. A README is a beacon of\ntransparency\n, and helps set the tone for any working relationship.\nCoaching\nWhat is coaching?\nCoaching\nis about helping others help themselves. It is not about giving advice, instruction, or telling someone what to do.\nCoaching is about focusing on the future and identifying where the coachee wants to be and what they want to achieve.\nAt GitLab, we‚Äôve defined coaching as a conversation that helps people think for themselves, find their own answers, and commit to action they design. As a coach, your role is to clarify the pathway from the current state to the future. Coaches do this by enabling the coachee to make informed choices based on deeper insight.\nNo matrix organization\nPlease see\nno-matrix-organization\nStable counterparts\nWe want to promote organic cross-functional collaboration by giving people stable counterparts for other functions they need to work with. For example, each Strategic Account Executive (SAE) works with one Sales Development Representative (SDR). With our\ncategories\nevery backend team of developers maps to a\nProduct Manager (PM)\nand a\nfrontend team\n.\nGiving people a\nstable counterpart\nallows for more social trust and familiarity, which speeds up decision making, prevents communication problems, and reduces the risk of conflicts. This way we can work effectively cross functionally without the\ndownsides of a matrix organization\n.\nFactory vs. studio\nWe want the best combination of\na factory and a studio\n. The studio element means anyone can chime in about anything, from a user to the CEO. You can step outside your work area and contribute. The factory element means everyone has a clearly assigned task and authority.\nEffective escalations\nTeam members should feel comfortable escalating issues when help is needed to resolve unexpected challenges. Effective escalations are good, because they speed up decision making. When team members escalate an issue, another person is brought in as a decision maker or adviser as other team members disagree or need help with alignment or a serious trade-off is needed. Escalation can offer clarity and a path forward, and can be a sign of seniority for the person initiating the escalation when they know what, how, and when to escalate.\nAs noted in this\nmedium article\n, explicit esclatation should answer these four questions:\nWhy is this important to the person/team I‚Äôm escalating to?\nWhat are the relevant details of the challenge?\nWhat have you tried?\nWhat do you need?\nFolks who are escalating an issue should avoid surprising folks in the management chain. This means that other relevant team members should be aware that an escalation is occurring. For example, in E-Group, members agree that they will not go to the CEO with an escalation without first notifying other relevant members that this is happening.\nThere may be some exceptions to first notifying managers or peers. For example, a team member\nfeels unsafe\nin voicing a concern to a manager or their peers and feels that they can‚Äôt effectively escalate with standard notification without retribution. While exceptions may be appropriate, they should be rare.\nAfter a team member escalates an issue, it is OK if they\ndisagree, commit, and advocate\nwith the decisions made by the person they escalated to.\nProcess gets a bad rep\nProcess has a bad reputation. It has that reputation for things that we try to avoid doing at GitLab. When you have processes that are not needed it turns into a bureaucracy. A good example are approval processes. We should keep approval processes to a minimum, by both giving people the authority to make decisions by themselves and by having a quick lightweight approval process where needed.\nBut process also has good aspects. Having a documented process for how to communicate within the company greatly reduces time spend on on-boarding, increases speed, and prevents mistakes. A counterintuitive effect is that it also makes it easier to change processes. It is really hard to change a process that doesn‚Äôt have a name or location and lives in different versions in the heads of people. Changing a written process and distributing the\ndiff\nis much easier.\nTalent Acquisition and retention\nManagers have an tremendous responsibility around talent acquisition and\nretention\nof team members.\nVoluntary departures should be low, especially unexpected ones. The most common reasons for resignations can be tied back to the manager.\nWe want few candidates to decline an offer, especially when the reason isn‚Äôt compensation.\nWe need adequate candidate pipeline volume and quality, especially for crucial positions.\nCandidates that have a proposed offer should meet the bar, especially for more senior positions.\nBuild a\nglobal team\n. Unless shown with a business case, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt find the talent out of the bay‚Äù goes against our\ndiversity, inclusion and belonging mission\nand the\nLocation Factor KPI\n.\nHigh Output Management\nGitLab leadership and management approach was built using principles covered in the book ‚Äú\nHigh Output Management\n.‚Äù Please see\nHigh Output Management\nto learn more.\nBuilding High Performing Teams\nBuilding a team to deliver\nresults\nis a very important aspect of improving\nefficiency\nand\niteration\n. A high-performing team will always deliver results. As a leader at GitLab, your role is to develop a high-performing team to reach the desired level of performance and productivity. There are certain traits that high-performing teams display at GitLab:\nHave a clear vision of their objectives and goals\nStay committed to achieving their goals\nManage conflicts\nMaintain effective communication and a healthy relationship with each other\nMake unanimous decisions as a team\nWatch the replay of our conversation with\nJeb Hurley, Co-founder and Managing Partner Brainware Partners\nwhere we discussed:\nManaging trust, productivity, and well-being on remote teams\nBehavior, biochemistry, and dynamics of trust\nThe value of measuring and reporting on impacts of building trust\nSkills and behavior of\nbuilding high performing teams competency\nfor Managers\n:\nModels and encourages teamwork by fostering collaboration, communication,\ntrust\n, shared goals, mutual accountability and support\nFosters an environment where results are balanced with time management of multiple assignments and\nDirect Responsible Individuals (DRI‚Äôs)\non important topics\nEmpowers team members to be a\nManager of One\nand gives them the tools to grow professionally in their careers\nAttracts and retains top talent by creating an inclusive environment\nbuilt on trust\n, delegation, accountability, and teachability\nStrategies to Build High Performing Teams\nThe\nDrexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model\nis an excellent tool to help\nbuild high performing teams\nat GitLab. The model provides a roadmap for a team and a common language. It is a simplified description of how a team works together that highlights the most important things the team needs to focus on to reach high performance. At GitLab, we can use it as a frame of reference to developing high performing teams. It can help Managers ensure new and existing team members know the mission and direction of the team by the following:\nTo form your team\nTo guide what your team does\nTo monitor how well your team is doing\nTo diagnose where your team may be struggling or identify the keys to your team‚Äôs success.\n7 Stages to developing high performing teams:\nOrientation - Why are we here? Team members need to see a sense of team identity and how individual team members fit in.\nTrust Building\n- Who are you? Team members share mutual regard for each other and are open and supportive of trust-based relationships.\nGoal Clarification - What are we doing? Assumptions are made clear; individual assumptions are made known with a clear vision of the end state.\nCommitment - How will we do it? Team members understand how it will make decisions and do the work.\nImplementation - Who does what, when, where? Team members have a sense of clarity and can operate effectively due to the alignment of shared goals.\nHigh Performance - Wow! The team is accomplishing more than it expected. The team has taken off, creativity is fostered and goals are surpassed.\nRenewal - Why continue? The team is given recognition and celebrates achievements of individuals that produce valuable work. Reflect on lessons learned and reassess for the future.\nManager Resource: Identifying & Addressing Burnout\nBuilding and maintaining high performance includes staying mindful of team well-being and potential burnout. With GitLab‚Äôs results-driven culture, the demands of product innovation around AI, the fast-paced and ever-evolving business environment, our organization recognizes the crucial balance between achieving ambitious goals and maintaining the well-being of our team members. Everyone can access this handbook\nresource designed for managers to identify & address burnout\n. This has an ongoing impact on team performance.\nManager M-Team Groups\nM-teams are management support groups made up of 3 to 6 managers who are in timezones that allow for sync meetings among members. M-teams should set up a regular meeting on a cadence agreed by the members with the agenda being ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs challenging this week?‚Äù. Decide who will facilitate and each person will get a chance to have their challenge discussed in the meeting. When it‚Äôs your turn, you talk a little about what you‚Äôre struggling with. M-groups agree to a level of\nconfidentiality\nso that group members are willing to be vulnerable; vulnerability leads to trust and better outcomes for the group.\nIf you‚Äôre interested in starting or joining an m-team meeting, reach out to other managers in the\n#managers\nSlack channel.\nArticles\nCarta‚Äôs Manager‚Äôs FAQ\nCarta‚Äôs How to hire\nHow Facebook Tries to Prevent Office Politics\nThe Management Myth\nLater Stage Advice for Startups\nMental Models I Find Repeatedly Useful\nThis Is The Most Difficult Skill For CEOs To Learn\nGreat article about\nhow to think about PIPs\n, although our time scales are shorter.\nImpraise Blog: 1-on-1s for Engaged Employees\nMind Tools: Giving Feedback: Keeping Team Member Performance High, and Well Integrated\nRemote.Co: 5 Tips for Providing Feedback to Remote Workers\nReally interesting blog post from Hanno on remote team feedback\n51 questions to ask in one-on-ones with a manager\nHBR: The rise of data driven decision making is real but uneven\nForbes: 6 Tips for Making Better Decisions\nBooks\nBooks in this section\ncan be expensed\n.\nNotable books from the\nE-Group Offsite Book Selections\nmay be added to the list below.\nWe sometimes self-organize\nbook clubs\nto read through these books as a group.\nHigh Output Management\n- Andrew Grove\nTop 10 quotes\nBook club\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers\n- Ben Horowitz\nChase Wright‚Äôs notes\nCrucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High\n- Kerry Patterson\nNotes from the\nE-group\nreading:\nVirtual teams are much more likely to fail on crucial conversations than colocated teams\nWe need to develop the skill of sensing the tone of a-sync conversations to uncover potential issues\nWe need to find a way to create\npsychological safety\nfor people in official channels\nStarting with empathy is a great way to gather the context needed in a tense situation - this is hard a-sync, but more important\nConsider getting context 1-on-1 (through Slack) before posting a comment in an issue that you might regret later\nAs leaders, we need to give context as well.

Our goal is to enable payments in a timely manner to both our team members and our external partners. We also provide useful links to other areas of the handbook that are relevant to the Accounts Payable procedures.\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Accounts Payable, commonly referred to as AP. You should be able to find answers to most of your questions in the sections below. If you cannot find what you are looking for, then please connect with us:\nChat Channel\n:\n#accountspayable\nEmail\n:\nap@gitlab.com\nGeneral Guidelines\nVendors must be onboarded in Coupa to process invoices.\nAll purchases/services with a total contract value over $5000 are\nrequired\nto have a purchase order, unless it falls under the\nPO Exception Policy\n. One-time or purchases totaling <$5000 annually may be processed without a PO per the PO Exception Policy\nEnsure to indicate the PO number in the invoice copy. For Non-PO invoice, provide the related department to be charged.\nVendors are highly encouraged to directly upload their invoices and match it to their PO using the Coupa Supplier Portal- in the event the vendor is unable to submit invoices via Coupa then they can email PDF copies to\nap@gitlab.com\n.\nPayment Runs are completed on Thursdays. Invoices that are selected for payment on Thursday must be fully approved and vendors successfully on-boarded by end of day Tuesday of that week to be included in Thursday‚Äôs payment run. The payments go out in the following days and may take 1-5 business days to reach the vendor‚Äôs bank. This depends on the country, currency and the method of payment chosen.\nInvoices are paid strictly by the invoice due dates. Any\n‚ÄúUrgent Payment‚Äù\nrequests will be paid in the next available payment run as long as they have been fully approved and the vendor has been successfully on-boarded.\nAP cannot accommodate same day payment requests\n.\nSuppliers are to be paid via CoupaPay, ACH or Wire only. AP does not issue check payments.\nThe cutoff for customer refund payments is the 25th of each month. Any customer refund requests received after the 25th will be paid the following month.\nAccounts Payable Processing\nVendor Invoices - These invoices are processed in Coupa either PO Backed or Non PO backed. Vendors must be set up or onboarded in Coupa and invoices must contain all required information like Invoice Number, Invoice Date, Payment Terms, PO Number, Invoice Amount, Currency, and Service Dates/Period to proceed with processing. Quotations, Order Forms, Agreements, Contracts are not valid for invoice processing, only ‚ÄúInvoice‚Äù is allowed.\nIf the invoice doesn‚Äôt fall under the PO Exception Policy, please ensure the invoice has a corresponding PO before sending it to the AP Team for processing.\nFor PO Backed invoices, kindly ensure that the PO is already approved to proceed with processing and do not attach the invoice in the PO as AP Team will not be able to check/monitor that section.\nKindly ensure that the PO has enough balance to process the invoice. Do not provide a PO number that has been fully matched or already closed to the vendor as it may create confusion on both sides.\nIf you need to do a PO Change Request (e.g. to add funds in your current PO), please refer to this\nvideo tutorial\nfrom Procurement Team.\nVendors can process their invoice in their Coupa Supplier Portal using the PO Flip method. On this\nlink\nplease find\n‚ÄúCreate an invoice from a PO‚Äù\nfor the video tutorial.\nVendors can also send their invoices to\nAP@gitlab.com\n. PO numbers are required to be reflected on the invoice copy or in the email body to avoid delays in processing.\nFor Non-PO invoices sent by GitLab DRI, please indicate the department to be charged instead and the Coupa approver.\nIf the invoice is received without a PO, the AP Team will reach out to the GitLab DRI and request to create a PO. Once the PO is created, DRI must email the AP Team for the PO number to proceed with processing.\nExternal Supplier Forms are to be final approved by AP Team so that the vendor will be activated in Coupa, to provide our final approval, the vendor must comply with these two important documents so we can properly check the supplier form in our queue.\nW9 for US vendors and W8 for NON US vendors\nBank details in a signed bank letterhead\nYou can learn more about Coupa in this\nCoupa Guide Link\nand if you need further assistance you may also check the\nProcurement Handbook Page\n.\nPayroll Invoices - These are invoices provided by the Payroll Team for processing and will be manually input in Netsuite. Approval signatures are indicated on the invoice.\nInvoices with amounts greater than or equal to USD $500,000 are required to have 2 signatories from the Payroll Team (Manager and Director).\nCodings must be provided on the payroll banking tracker.\nSpecial Invoices - Mostly these are related to reimbursements (e.g. Speaker Reimbursement, Interview Candidate Reimbursement, Ex-Team Member Reimbursement and BOD Reimbursements).\nA template is required and must contain all the necessary information such as Vendor Name/Name of the person to be reimbursed, Invoice Date, Payment Terms, Invoice Amount, Currency, and Service Dates/Period. Receipts are required as a supporting document  for any reimbursement requests.\nAll templates must contain the full banking information of the beneficiary. If not applicable please put N/A.\nBank Name:\nBeneficiary Name:\nBeneficiary Address:\nAccount Number:\nRouting/ABA number:\nWire Number:\nSwift Code/BIC:\nSort Code:\nTransit Number And Institution Number:\nIFSC Code: (For India)\nBSB Code: (For Australia)\nFor Speaker Reimbursement, kindly advise the related PO of the event that the speaker attended as we will align the recording of the expense same as the PO. The PO details can be indicated on the reimbursement template or in the email.\nAccounts Payable Payments\nThe first step to getting an invoice paid is to review the appropriate\nprocurement process\n.\nMake note that invoices are paid per the due date on the invoice or per the vendors payment terms in their contract, whichever comes first.\nPlease note that\nAP cannot process same day requests for payments\n. We must follow the process outlined above and ensure all approvals are attained before paying.\nPayments are set up each\nThursday\nand the money is released to vendors through the respective payment systems. It may take a few days for transfers to reach vendors depending on their location and the bank they use.\nIn order for an invoice to be included on the Thursday payment run, it must have been received and fully approved by the Tuesday.\nFor example\n, if we are doing a payment batch on Thursday June 3rd, the invoice would have to be approved by end of day on Tuesday, June 1st in order to be included.\nManual Payments are\nonly\napplicable to the following:\nPayroll Invoices\nSpeaker Reimbursement\nEx-Team member reimbursement\nInterview Candidate Reimbursement\nBOD Reimbursement\nCoupa Virtual Card\nGitLab‚Äôs preferred method of payment for suppliers is electronic funds transfer with supplier invoice provided as supporting documentation. In the instances where this option is not available with the supplier,\nVirtual Card\n, which is a temporary credit card, can be used as an alternative payment method.\nFedex\nWhen needing to send a package on behalf of GitLab our main courier account is with FedEx.\nThe first step is to contact AP in the #AccountsPayable channel to request the corporate account number.\nWhen sending a package\nthe Shipper MUST put their name under GitLab Inc in the sender field, or their full Cost Center for ex. Marketing - Field Marketing.\nIf you are unsure of your full cost center please go into your Workday application (click Profile icon > click Job > select Organization . look for Cost Center).\nAnyone failing to provide the correct information which will hinder AP‚Äôs ability to properly code courier charges will not be allowed to use the company account in the future.\nGlobal Travel and Expense\nPlease review the page on\nSpending Company Money\nto ensure that your spend is within GitLab‚Äôs\nExpense policy\n.\nGitLab utilizes\nNavan Travel\nfor all travel related Flights, Hotels, Train Travel and Vehicle Rental bookings and\nNavan Expense\nfor all Employee reimbursable expenses.\nIt also includes the preparation for\nNavan Purchase Card\nand\nPhysical Cards\n.\nNavan Purchase Card\n- These are virtual cards only utilized by the AP team, and they are used solely for providing new Team Members with a $1,500 USD (or local currency equivalent) stipend for their home office set up upon onboarding.\nPhysical Cards\n- The purpose of this Navan Physical Card policy is to facilitate purchases necessary for the company operations and expedite the process in an efficient manner. Limit is set to $10,000 USD and provided upon request of an approved issue.\nIf you have general questions about your expenses please submit a ticket to\nHelpLab\n.\nWith the launch of HelpLab - We are kindly requesting that all questions be directed to the AP Admin team via the HelpLab ticket Process for\nGeneral Expenses Related Inquiry\n.\nQuickLinks\nInvoicing and Payment\nCorporate Credit Card\nProcurement\nReference link\nCoupa Tech Stack Guide\nNavan Expense Stack Guide\nCoupa Virtual Card guide for Accounts Payable\nCoupa Tech Stack Guide\nReference for how Coupa is implemented.\nNavan Expense Tech Stack Guide\nReference for how Navan Expense is implemented.\nNavan Physical Card\n1.

To deliver on this mission, it‚Äôs important to have a clearly defined and repeatable flow for\nturning an idea into something that offers customer value. Note that it‚Äôs also important to allow\nopen source contributions at any point in the process from the wider GitLab community - these won‚Äôt\nnecessarily follow this process.\nThis page is an evolving description of how we expect our cross-functional development teams to work, and reflects the current workflow being leveraged. All required actions or outcomes in this page are denoted as follows:\nDenotes a required aspect of the product development flow.\nFeature development is expected to pass through all phases to achieve specified outcomes, while the rest of the workflow should be considered as a set of best practices, tools, and recommendations. We realize there are unique cases in which certain product improvements may not need to flow through all the phases. We trust product managers to use their best judgement with alignment from their design and engineering team. The goal of this page is to support teams in their workflows by highlighting the necessary\noutcomes\nto target in each phase as well as sharing strategies/tactics,\nactivities\n, teams can employ to achieve these  outcomes. Additionally, this page aims to clarify the\nminimal\nAs teams leverage the product development flow, they may find that certain strategies/tactics are serving their teams well toward success. Therefore, we welcome MRs to this page, so we can create a robust playbook of options to build valuable features for customers. All team members are encouraged to follow the\nchange process\nfor this page to share their best practices.\nMeasuring Success\nWe take both a qualitative and quantitative approach to measuring success of the Product Development Flow. Details on the measures and results are available on\nthis handbook page\n.\nBut Wait, Isn‚Äôt This Waterfall?\nWe aim to achieve key outcomes in each phase in order to de-risk subsequent phases. However, the product development flow doesn‚Äôt dictate the order we go through the phases, or the time spent in each. When teams have a high confidence in their direction, they should feel empowered to skip or shorten phases that won‚Äôt contribute to improved confidence.\nExamples:\nAn engineering team conducts a technical review while other team members are performing Validation Phase activities. The team can then move to the Build phase rapidly with high confidence that their improvement is good for customers and technically feasible.\nA bug is reported by a GitLab customer. The Product Manager tests the bug and confirms its existence (Problem Validation). The team is extremely confident in the solution, so Design and Solution Validation are not needed. The bug is moved immediately to Build.\nWorkflow Summary\nProduct Development Flow diagram.\nUnable to load this content, check console for details.\nWe use workflow labels to efficiently communicate an issue‚Äôs state. Using these labels enables collaboration across teams and communicates an issue‚Äôs current state.\nThe workflow labels are prefixed with\nworkflow::\n, such as\nworkflow::ready for development\n. The following diagram shows how a new issue moves to each workflow label, though states can be skipped when appropriate. The rest of this document describes each workflow step in detail.\nstateDiagram-v2\n[*] --> ValidationBacklog: New issue created\nValidationBacklog: validation backlog\nProblemValidation: problem validation\nReadyForDesign: ready for design\nDesign: design\nSolutionValidation: solution validation\nValidationBacklog --> ProblemValidation\nProblemValidation --> ReadyForDesign: (Optional) Needs design\nReadyForDesign --> Design\nProblemValidation --> SolutionValidation\nDesign --> SolutionValidation\nPlanningBreakdown: planning breakdown\nScheduling: scheduling\nRefinement: refinement\nReadyForDev: ready for development\nInDev: in dev\nInReview: in review\nVerification: verification\nComplete: complete\nBlocked: blocked\nSecurity: awaiting security release\nSolutionValidation --> PlanningBreakdown: PM signals intent to prioritize\nPlanningBreakdown --> Scheduling: (Optional) Awaiting scheduling\nPlanningBreakdown --> Refinement: (Optional) Needs refinement\nPlanningBreakdown --> ReadyForDev: Has type label & weight.

However all collaborators can and should contribute when they see discrepancies or needed updates.\nValidation track\nFor situations\nwhen the customer problem isn‚Äôt well understood\n, Product Managers (PMs) and the User Experience Department (UXers) should work together to validate new opportunities before moving to the Build track. The\nValidation\ntrack is an independent track from the always moving\nBuild\ntrack. PMs and UXers should work together to get at least two months ahead, so that the Build track always has well-validated product opportunities ready to start. Milestone work should be\nprioritized\nwith the understanding that some milestones may include more validation efforts than others. Validation cycles may not be necessary for things like bug fixes, well understood iterative improvements, minor design fixes, and technical debt.\nValidation Spectrum\nThe types of activities and depth of research required in the validation track will depend on how well we understand the customer problem and solution.\nValidation Goals & Outcomes\nWhen:\nWhen our confidence about the proposed problem or solution isn‚Äôt high. For example, if we aren‚Äôt reasonably sure that the problem is important to a significant number of users, or that the solution is easy to understand and use.\nWho:\nProduct Manager, Product Designer, UX Researcher, Product Design Manager, Engineering Manager\nWhat:\n‚úÖ\nUnderstand\nthe user problem we are trying to solve.\n‚úÖ\nIdentify\nbusiness goals and key metrics to determine success.\n‚úÖ\nGenerate\nhypotheses and research/experiment/user-test.\n‚úÖ\nDefine\nMVC and potential future iterations.\n‚úÖ\nMinimize\nrisks to value, usability, feasibility, and business viability with qualitative and quantitative analysis.\nOutcome:\nWe have confidence that a proposed solution will positively impact one or more\nProduct KPIs\n. There may be reason for exceptions, so the team would need to be clear in that case, and be able to justify that it‚Äôs still important without mapping back to our KPIs.\nIf we don‚Äôt have confidence in the MVC or what success looks like, we should continue validation cycles before we move to the Build track.\nValidation phase 1: Validation backlog\nLabel:\nworkflow::validation backlog\nKey Participants\nRole\nFunction\nProduct Manager\nCollaborators\nProduct Designer\nProduct Design Manager\nEngineering Manager\nInformed\nCustomers\nCustomer Success Manager\nProduct Marketing Manager\nOther\nstakeholders\nas appropriate\nDescription\nThe growth of a world class product is built from a well maintained backlog. Product Managers are responsible for refining a group‚Äôs backlog to ensure validation opportunities are scoped and\nprioritized\nin line with category direction, stage, and/or section level strategy. The backlog is also the single source of truth for\nstakeholders\nto understand and engage with your group. An issue position in the backlog, along with the description, discussion, and metadata on those issues are key pieces of data necessary to keep stakeholders up to date.\nOutcomes and Activities\nOutcomes\nActivities\nUp to date issues and epics\n: At GitLab, issues are the single source of truth for any change to the product. Keeping these up to date increases efficiency and transparency by allowing all team members to understand the planned work.\n- Create issues in response to a\nsensing mechanism\n.¬†Consider using the\nProblem Validation\nissue template for new features.\n- Review issue discussions and update relevant info in the description.\n- Keep metadata (such as labels) up-to-date.\n- Actively respond to stakeholder comments.\n- Transfer discussion notes, and external information to the issue (as links or discussion/description details).\nProduct Manager\nPrioritized backlog\n: The issue and epic backlog is the primary signal stakeholders use to know what‚Äôs ‚Äúup next‚Äù for a group. The backlog is also the queue for a group to work from, as features progress through the Product Development Flow phases. This queue is kept up to date with milestones and rank ordering on issue boards.\n- Regular review of issue prioritization (such as issue board ordering and milestone assignment).\n- Align prioritized backlog to category direction and category maturity state.\n-¬†Consider using the\nRICE formula\nto help make prioritization tradeoffs.\n-¬†Consider holding\nprioritization sessions\nto collect priority feedback from stable counterparts as there are\nother DRIs for bug and maintenance work\n.\nProduct Manager\nValidation phase 2: Problem validation\nLabel:\nworkflow::problem validation\nKey Participants\nRole\nFunction\nProduct Manager\nCollaborators\nProduct Designer\nUX Researcher\nInformed\nDevelopment team\nOther\nstakeholders\nas appropriate\nDescription\nTo ensure the right solutions are delivered, the team must start their work with a\nvalidated problem\n. This can take\nmany forms\nand be achieved through Product Manager, Product Designer and UX Researcher collaboration.\nIf the problem is documented and well-understood, it may be possible to quickly move through this phase by documenting the known data about the user problem. A documented problem can be categorized as a pre-existing experience from feedback directly from users or an issue that has user engagement confirming that the problem is experienced by multiple users. A well-understood problem can be one that has a series of documented qualitative research from customer interviews led by the Product Manager, triangulating\ndifferent sensing mechanisms\nconfirming the problem, or using known data. Some examples of known data include\nCustomer Request Issues\nor pre-existing\nActionable Insights\nfrom prior research. To document that a problem is well-understood, link the known data and any customer calls to the relevant issues and epics.\nIf the problem is nuanced or not yet well understood, then it will likely take longer to validate with users properly. This phase‚Äôs primary outcome is a clear understanding of the problem, along with a simple and clear way to communicate the problem to various stakeholders. Although optional, it is recommended to use an\nOpportunity Canvas\nas a tool that helps individuals better understand a problem, and communicate it to various stakeholders. An Opportunity Canvas can also be used to recommend creation of a new category including asking for new resourcing.\nOutcomes and Activities\nOutcomes\nActivities\nThorough understanding of the problem\n: The team understands the problem, who it affects, when and why, and how solving the problem maps to business needs and product strategy.\n- Create an issue using the\nProblem Validation Template\nin the GitLab project.\n- Complete an\nOpportunity Canvas\n.\n- Schedule a review of the opportunity canvas for feedback.\n- Create an issue using the\nProblem Validation Research Template\nin the UX Research project and work with UX Researcher to execute the research study.\n- Validate your problem with users using any of the\nproposed methods\nand\ndocument your findings in Dovetail\n.\nProduct Manager\nUpdate issue/epic description\n: A well understood and clearly articulated customer problem is added to the issue, and will lead to successful and efficient design and development phases.\n- Ensure your issue is up-to-date with the latest understanding of the problem.\n- Understand and document (in the issue) the goals that people want to accomplish using the\nJobs to be Done (JTBD)\nframework.\n- Conduct\ncontinuous interviews\nwith customers on a regular cadence to stay up-to-date on the problems that users face.\n- Leverage your\nopportunity canvas\nto communicate the problem to your stable counterparts and group stakeholders. Consider scheduling a review to gather feedback and communicate the findings to Product and UX leadership.\n- Confirm that the Product Designer understands the problem well enough to ideate on solutions.\nProduct Manager\nInitiate the Dogfooding Process: When validating problems, it‚Äôs important to gather feedback from\ninternal customers\n, in addition to the broader community. Capturing internal customer feedback early on in the product development flow helps ensure their needs are considered as the feature matures, accelerating key\nDogfooding\noutcomes. Driving internal usage of features consistently\nleads to greater customer adoption\nand is required for\nviable maturity\n.\n- PMs are strongly encouraged to open\nDogfooding issues\nduring the validation phase and capture internal customer feedback to help inform initial and/or future iterations of a feature.\nProduct Manager\nValidation phase 3: Design\nLabels:\nworkflow::design\nKey Participants\nRole\nFunction\nProduct Designer\nCollaborators\nProduct Manager\nEngineering Manager\nDevelopment team\nUX Researcher\nSoftware Engineer in Test\nTechnical Writer\nLegal & Corporate Affairs\nInformed\nProduct Design Manager\nApplication Security Engineer\nOther\nstakeholders\nas appropriate\nDescription\nAfter understanding and validating the problem, we can begin or continue to ideate potential solutions through a\ndiverge/converge\nprocess. However, if the outcome from the problem validation phase confidently suggests an incremental modification to the existing solution, the aforementioned diverge/converge process could be skipped.\nThe Product Designer leads the team (Product Manager, Engineering team, UX Researcher, Software Engineers in Test, and Technical Writers, as needed, depending on the item) in ideating potential solutions and exploring different approaches (diverge) before converging on a single solution. Product Managers and the Engineering team evaluate solutions by determining if they meet customer and business goals, are technically feasible, and align with legal compliance considerations. The team is encouraged to engage with stakeholders to determine potential flaws, missed use cases, potential security risks, and if the solution has the intended customer impact.\nDuring this phase the  Product Manager and Engineering Manager are both responsible for reviewing the\nLegal Risk Checklist\n(accessible to team members only) and determining whether any sections need to be completed. After the team converges on the proposed solution or identifies a small set of options to validate, the issue moves into the Solution Validation phase.\nTo start the Design phase, the Product Designer or Product Manager applies the\nworkflow::design\nlabel to an existing issue or, if needed, creates a new issue with this label.\nOutcomes and Activities\nOutcomes\nActivities\nProposed solution(s) identified and documented\n: The Product Designer works with the Product Manager and Engineering team to explore solutions and identifies the approach(es) that strike the best balance of user experience, customer value, business value, and development cost.\nThe Product Designer optionally apply by\nworkflow::ready for design\nlabel to the issue, signaling the design backlog of next issues to be done is prioritized.\nDiverge\n: explore multiple different approaches as a team. Example activities:\n-\nThink Big\nsession.\nInternal interviews (be sure to\ndocument findings in Dovetail\n).\n- Creating\nuser flows\n.\nConverge\n: identify a small set of options to validate. Example activities:\n-\nThink Small\nsession with the team.\n- Design reviews with team\n- Low fidelity design ideas.\n- Update issue/epic description with proposed solution. Add Figma design file link or attach design to\nGitLab‚Äôs Design Management\nto communicate the solution idea. Read to understand\nwhat tool to use\n.\n- Validate approach with help from stakeholders.

This confidence can be obtained from work performed during the design phase and supplemented with additional research (including user interviews, usability testing, or solution validation). If necessary, this phase will launch a Solution Validation issue within the\nGitLab UX Research project\nwhich will walk the team through research to validate their proposed solution(s).\nIn addition, any\nnon-functional requirements\nfor the feature need to be considered and documented. These include such things as evaluating whether or not\napplication limits\nneed to be introduced, or any\nconsiderations around data storage\nshould be evaluated. Defining these non-functional requirements up front ensures we are considering scalability and the long-term success of the feature. Sensible default values should be identified at this stage which align with the long-term vision for the feature.\nTo start the Solution Validation phase, the Product Designer or Product Manager applies the\nworkflow::solution validation\nlabel to an existing issue.\nOutcomes and Activities\nOutcomes\nActivities\nHigh confidence in the proposed solution\n: Confidence that the jobs to be done outlined within the problem statement can be fulfilled by the proposed solution.\n- Gather feedback from relevant stakeholders.\n- Follow\nsolution validation guidance\nto gather feedback.\nProduct Designer\nDocumented Solution validation Learnings\n: The results of the solution validation is communicated to and understood by team members.\n- Document solution validation findings as\ninsights in Dovetail\n.\n- Update the\nopportunity canvas\n(if used) with relevant insights.\n- Update issue or epic description to contain or link to the findings.\nProduct Designer\nBuild track\nThe build track is where we plan, develop, and deliver value to our users by building\nMVCs\n, fixing defects, patching security vulnerabilities, enhancing user experience, and improving performance. This track is also a time\nwhen we get insight into whether we are creating the right thing\nfor our users. DRIs across engineering disciplines involving\nDesign, Backend, Frontend and Quality\nwork closely together to implement MVCs while in close collaboration with the Product Manager. Decisions are made quickly if challenges arise. We instrument\nusage\nand track\nproduct performance\n, so after MVCs are delivered to customers, feedback is captured quickly for learnings to\nrefine the next iteration\n. For an example of how to leverage GitLab‚Äôs various features to create a focused and collaborative board to flow through the Build track,\ncheck out this video\n.\nBuild Goals & Outcomes\nWhen:\nAs we build MVCs according to our\nproduct development timeline\nWho:\nProduct Manager, Product Designer, Development team, Software Engineer in Test\nWhat:\n‚úÖ\nRelease\nto a subset or full set of customers as appropriate.\n‚úÖ\nAssess\nUX, functional, technical performance, and customer impact.\n‚úÖ\nCollect\ndata to measure MVC against success metrics to inform the next iteration.\n‚úÖ\nIterate\nuntil success metrics are achieved and the product experience is optimal.\nOutcome:\nDeliver performant MVCs that improve one or more of our\nProduct KPIs\nand/or\nEngineering KPIs\n.

Bugs, technical debt, and other similar changes that are not features may enter the process in this phase (or may benefit from entering in earlier phases based on the cost of doing the work requiring the full problem to be validated to ensure it makes sense to do the work). Following Validation Phase 4 the feature should already be broken down into the quickest change possible to improve the user‚Äôs outcome and be ready for a more detailed review by engineering. During this phase, Product Managers will surface issues they intend to prioritize for a milestone by applying the\nworkflow::planning breakdown\nlabel. At this point, Engineering Managers will assign an engineer to further break down and apply weights to that work. This process is a collaboration between the DRI and Collaborators. Tradeoff decisions can be made and feature issues evolve from validation solutions to clear MVCs that can be delivered in a single milestone. Be sure to document all decisions on issues.\nDuring this phase, the Product Manager and the Engineering Manager must revisit the\nLegal Risk Checklist\n(accessible to team members only) to make sure none of their previous determinations during Validation phase 3: Design need revision.\nBy reviewing and weighing work in the beginning of the Build Track, Product Managers are able to make better prioritization tradeoffs and engineering teams can ensure they‚Äôve scoped the right amount of work for the milestone. If an issue enters the\nworkflow::planning breakdown\nstate it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will be prioritized in the next milestone, a Product Manager may make a tradeoff decision depending on capacity, and urgency.\nOnce work has passed the\nworkflow::planning breakdown\nstep, the\nworkflow::ready for development\n,\ntype::\nlabels along with an upcoming milestone are applied to the issue. If an issue has been broken down, but not yet ready to pull into a milestone you may optionally apply the\nworkflow::scheduling\nlabel; however, in this state any issue that has the\nworkflow::ready for development\nlabel without a milestone has an implied status of ‚Äúwaiting to be scheduled‚Äù. Engineering Managers and/or Product Design Managers will apply\nDeliverable\nlabel to issues with a milestone and marked\nworkflow::ready for development\nsignaling acceptance of the issue for that milestone. This process occurs at the\nbeginning of milestone planning\n.\nDuring this phase, it‚Äôs important to keep Application Security Engineers informed to ensure that they have visibility into planning schedule. This provides them with sufficient time for planning dynamic testing so they can keep the product manager and development team informed of any time/resource requirements.\nOutcomes and Activities\nOutcomes\nActivities\nWell-scoped MVC issues\n- Issues are the\nfor all feature development.\n- Refine issues into something that can be delivered within a single milestone\n- Open follow on issues to track work that is de-prioritized\n- Promote existing issues to Epics and open implementation issues for the upcoming milestone\n- Review feature issues with contributors\n- Consider scheduling a POC or engineering investigation issue\n- Make scope tradeoffs to reach for a\nright-sized MVC\n- Request an issue review to ensure communication is clear and have proposed the\nright iteration plan\nto execute on the solution.\n- Product Manager\nPrioritized Milestone\n- The team should understand what issues should be delivered during the next milestone\n- Product Manager sets\nworkflow::ready for development\n,\ntype::\n, and a milestone signaling intent to prioritize\n- Product Designer and Engineering Manager apply\nDeliverable\nlabel signaling acceptance of issue in the next milestone - Product Manager creates a planning issue\n- Product Manager, Product Designer, and Engineering Manager\nDefined Quality Plan\n- Involving SETs in this phase ensures they are able to understand and effectively plan their own capacity before engineering is truly underway.\n- Quad Planning\n-\nTest planning\n- Software Engineer in Test\nImplementation Issue Refinement\n- Some teams have found it useful to treat issue refinement as a separate, iterative task from planning breakdown.

The PM is directly responsible for\noverall prioritization\nof a milestone, including bugs and maintenance work; however, the Engineering Manager and software engineers are responsible for the implementation using the\nengineering workflow\n. Engineering owns the\ndefinition of done\nand issues are not moved into the next phase until those requirements are met. Keep in mind that many team members are likely to contribute to a single issue and collaboration is key.\nThis phase begins after work has been broken down, and\nprioritized\nin Phase 1. Work is completed in priority order as set at the beginning of the milestone. The Engineering Manager will assign an issue to an engineer who is responsible for building the feature or addressing a bug or maintenance issue. An engineer can also self-serve and pick up the next priority order issue from the\nworkflow::ready for development\nqueue on their team‚Äôs board. That engineer will update its\nworkflow::\nlabel to indicate where it‚Äôs position in the\ndevelopment process\n.\nWhen an issue is in\nworkflow::in review\n, the Application Security Engineer would help validate the risk mitigations through the non-blocking\napplication security review process\n.\nDocumentation for the work will be developed by the engineer and the Technical Writer (see\nDocumentation with code as a workflow\n). The Technical Writer should review the documentation as part of the development process. Items discovered during a documentation review should not block issues moving into the next phase. This may drive the creation of follow-on improvement MRs for the documentation, after release.\nAfter the feature code has been merged, the issue should be moved to\nworkflow::verification\n.\nWhen an issue is in\nworkflow::verification\n, the responsible engineer will\nmanually test the feature\nin either the Staging or Production environment.\nNote: Work deemed out-of-scope or incomplete by engineering is taken back into the\nplan phase\nfor refinement and rescheduling for completion.\nOutcomes and Activities\nOutcomes\nActivities\nFeature is built\n- Engineering Manager check that\ndefinition of done\nis met\n- Provide regular status updates to stakeholders\n- Provide asynchronous updates to avoid status check-ins and synchronous stand-ups\n- Engineers follow the\nengineering process\nto implement assigned issues.\nEngineer\nFeature is tested\n- Engineers test features they implement (see\nDefinition of done\n).\n- SET sets testing requirements on the issue.\n- SET follows up on any specific test coverage changes necessary as an outcome of Quad Planning.\n- Technical Writers complete a\nreview\nof any developed documentation.\n- Application Security Engineer validates the risk mitigations through the non-blocking\napplication security review process\n.\nEngineer\nBuild phase 3: Launch\nIssue Status:\nClosed\nRequired Labels\nLabel\nUsage\nworkflow::complete\nApplied after the feature is deployed to production, any needed verification is complete, and the issue has been closed.\nKey Participants\nRole\nFunction\nDevelopment\n: Close issue after it‚Äôs available in production and any needed verification is complete.\nProduct Manager\n: Initiate\nrelease post item creation\nif they decide it‚Äôs warranted.\nProduct Manager\n: Continue the\ndogfooding process\nif they decide it‚Äôs applicable.\nProduct Manager\n: Consider alerting relevant stakeholders in appropriate Slack channels.\nCollaborators\nDevelopment team, Quality counterpart, and Product Manager may verify the feature is working as expected in production.

GitLab team members may also be informed by posts in relevant Slack channels.\nDescription\nWhen the change becomes available in production and any needed verification is complete, the issue is closed by the development team and the\nworkflow::complete\nlabel is added so stakeholders know work on it has been completed.

We started the process in mid-December, and by mid-January, the team were onboard and had joined GitLab‚Äôs summit in Canc√∫n, Mexico. Compared to previous acquisition attempts that we had been through with other companies, the professionalism and focus of the GitLab team was refreshing. It quickly became apparent to me that Sid, Paul and the team at GitLab were interested in striking a fair deal, and were as concerned about the outcome for the Gitter team as my co-founder and I were. In the year-and-half since, GitLab has continued to be a great home for Gitter and I‚Äôm incredibly proud to be part of the team.‚Äù\nPhilippe Lafoucri√®re\n, ‚ÄúWhen GitHub announced they would provide a Security graph and alerts, we knew we would not be able to compete with them. That meant the end of the story for us and our product. It was time to find a new home for the team. We started discussions with GitLab in November 2017 and officially joined the company in mid-January 2018. The whole process was seamless, with a particular care for the team. Expectations from both sides were discussed, with mutual respect and understanding.\nThe founders made themselves available for us at anytime, and we had regular meetings for several months until we all estimated the situation stable enough. Onboarding a whole team at once is a challenge: the peopleops team did everything they could to help and to make them feel comfortable with their new positions. They were happy to continue on the foundations we‚Äôve built over the years while being able to contribute to a greater goal. We managed to identify with the management where we could have the best impact, and provide results as soon as possible.\nI don‚Äôt see anything GitLab could have done differently to make this acquisition smoother. The most important value to follow in this kind of event is Trust (because you can only lose it once). GitLab, and especially its CEO, was incredibly clear and respectful during all the process and beyond.‚Äù\nGemnasium: Our GitLab journey\nKeys to successful acquisitions\nManaging people‚Äôs expectations and concerns\nSuccessful integration execution\nMaintain a non-biased view on target companies‚Äô value\nStarting an acquisition discussion with GitLab\nIf you are interested in starting acquisition discussions with GitLab, please send an email to\nCorporate Development\nto connect and start the process.\nAcquisition process\nLearn more about our internal\nacquisition process\nand how you can prepare for an efficient process.\nPerformance indicators\nSee our\nperformance indicators\n.\nFor additional information contact\nCorporate Development\n.\nAcquisition Process\nThis is a detailed view of our acquisition process.

In addition, the tax department manages GitLab‚Äôs statutory requirements including statutory audits, filing of entity-level financial information, transfer pricing, and ensuring intercompany transactions are recorded appropriately.\nContacting the Tax Team\nThe Tax Team is responsible for GitLab‚Äôs tax compliance (see here for payroll taxes), tax planning and accounting for business taxes, including income taxes and indirect taxes such as sales taxes and value-added taxes (VAT). Taxation differs between countries, and taxation in one country is not always complementary to taxation in another country, resulting in possible double-taxation on the same GitLab revenue. It is the fundamental goal of the Tax Team to minimize double taxation, to optimize our global effective tax rate, and to timely apply resources to various company needs. Those needs range from routine compliance and tax audits to strategically positioning the company for its next phase of growth.\nOrganization\nThe Tax team is part of the Finance function and headed by the VP Tax. The VP Tax reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The Tax team is structured to address (a) U.S. domestic taxes and global accounting for business taxes and (b) international tax planning and compliance, including US international tax planning.\nThis page has been moved to the internal handbook website due to safety/privacy:\nhttps://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/tax/\nFrequently Asked Questions - Tax ID for non-US customers\nWhat is a Tax ID?\nAn Indirect Tax Identification Number (‚ÄúIndirect Tax ID‚Äù or ‚ÄúTax ID‚Äù) is a unique identification number assigned by tax authorities to businesses registered for Value Added Tax (VAT), Goods and Services Tax (GST), or similar indirect taxes. This number identifies your business as a registered taxpayer eligible to charge and collect indirect taxes.\nWhy does GitLab need my Indirect Tax ID?\nGitLab is required to comply with local tax regulations in various jurisdictions. When you provide a valid Indirect Tax ID:\nGitLab may not need to charge VAT/GST on your invoices (reverse charge mechanism)\nIt helps ensure proper tax compliance for both parties\nIt may reduce your overall tax burden on GitLab services\nWithout a valid Indirect Tax ID, GitLab may be required to charge applicable VAT/GST rates based on your location.\nWhat if my business is not registered for VAT/GST?\nIf your business is not registered for indirect taxes (due to size thresholds or other reasons), you may not have an Indirect Tax ID. In such cases, GitLab will charge the applicable VAT/GST rate according to local regulations.\nSamples of Indirect Tax ID Formats by Country\nImportant Disclaimer:\nThe formats listed below are samples of commonly used indirect tax ID formats and are provided solely as a reference to assist customers.

{"doc_id": "0b27416887d11be6", "url": "https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles", "title": "Product Principles | The GitLab Handbook", "text": "The Handbook\nProduct Handbook\nProduct Principles\nThese are core principles we believe world class product organizations exhibit. The goal is to build a PM system that fosters and honors these principles, in a way that works for GitLab.\nPrinciples\n-\nProcesses\n-\nCategories\n-\nGitLab the Product\n-\nBeing a PM\n-\nLeadership\nOur Product Principles\nThese are core principles that we believe will deliver world-class products through customer-centric innovation. Our goal is to build a practice that fosters these principles with the customers‚Äô voice at the core. Everything we do is for our customers, and we are only successful when they succeed in delivering secure software faster to their customers and internal users.\nWe are customer zero, therefore we use our own product:\nEverything you put into the product should be a feature you or our Engineering team would use as part of our daily work. If the answer is no, then challenge your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, as there might be a better solution that will have a bigger impact for our customers.\nWe are not our only customer:\nMeet with customers as much as possible as everything we do is for them. It is tempting to assume that we understand our customers through our own usage and dogfooding, but that only gets you so far and we can be wrong. Validate assumptions through strategic user research, customer interviews, and feedback sessions.\nWe are design-led:\nIt does not matter what customer pain points you work with Engineering to resolve if what is provided to customers is hard (or almost impossible) to use. User experience is our top priority as we have a very technical product, however it should be easy enough for someone new to DevSecOps to get started quickly. This includes everything from onboarding to shipping secure software leveraging GitLab.\nWe value quality over velocity:\nDelivering incomplete features and capabilities to ensure your team achieves a defined velocity is not acceptable. Everything we ship to customers must be user validated, bug free, not introduce security vulnerabilities, be able to achieve GitLab.com scale, include documentation, and be available on all customer deployment choices simultaneously. Accruing additional technical debt in favor of velocity is also not acceptable as this leads to future quality issues around availability, scalability, reliability, and security.\nWe value data over intuition and anecdotes:\nEverything we build must have success metrics we can track to ensure we are providing value to our customers. We measure outcomes, not launches, and this is only possible with experimentation and proper instrumentation. All features must be instrumented so success metrics can be tracked and adjustments to plans can be made through product usage.\nWe fail fast and iterate with intention:\nDefine a hypothesis on how to address a customer use case or pain point and validate (or invalidate) it quickly through problem validation. Take the outcome of the problem validation cycle and build an iteration strategy to deliver it with a focus on usability and quality. Revalidate your hypothesis through solution validation with each iteration so you can adjust plans as needed. Problem and solution validation ensures the customer voice is key in making decisions.\nWe believe in product-led growth over unguided experiences:\nOur product should be GitLab‚Äôs best Sales team member, and its own biggest champion. Enable feature discovery moments to let customers know there is more value based on their usage, actions taken, or configuration choices. The more customers adopt our product‚Äôs capabilities, the more return on investment they experience, which builds more internal GitLab champions.\nWe like to win‚Ä¶and we only win as a team:\nWe win when our customers are able to successfully ship secure software faster with GitLab. This requires us to hold ourselves to the highest levels of execution and collaboration within Product across our Product Management, UX Research, Product Design, and Technical Writing teams. While teamwork within Product is necessary, it is also not sufficient. We require that same standard of execution and collaboration with our cross-functional team members across R&D and GTM. Together, as a global GitLab team, we can drive Results for Customers.\nHow we follow our Principles\nEnabling Collaboration\nFrom development teams to marketing organizations, everyone needs to collaborate\non digital content. Content should be open to suggestions by a wide number of\npotential contributors. Open contribution can be achieved by using a mergeable\nfile format and distributed version control. The\nmission of GitLab\nis to\nallow everyone to collaborate on all digital content\nso people can\ncooperate effectively and achieve better results, faster.\nBringing Ideas to Reality\nIdeas flow through many stages before they are realized. An idea originates in a\nchat discussion, an issue is created, it is planned in a sprint, coded in an\nIDE, committed to version control, tested by CI, code reviewed, deployed,\nmonitored, and documented. Stitching together all these stages of the DevOps\nlifecycle can be done in many different ways. You can have a marketplace of\nproprietary apps from different suppliers or use a suite of products developed\nin isolation.\nAs a single-application for the entire DevOps lifecycle, GitLab strives to enable you to bring ideas to production rapidly. We will do so AND avoid demonstrating our capabilities with toy app demos and simple trivial examples. That‚Äôs because we understand that\nbuilding a prototype is easy, but building a production line is hard\n.\nThe Minimal Valuable Change (MVC)\nMinimal Valuable Change (MVC) is the GitLab path to delivering the smallest measurable improvement for our users, customers, and the wider community.\nOur approach requires four pillars:\nRelentless customer focus and commitment to understanding their workflows, using research and validation\nMeasurable outcomes that use established metrics for success in tracking adoption, usage, or other business outcomes.\nProduct functionality that adheres to GA criteria listed in\nthe levels of support\nFuture vision to expand the MVC beyond the initial release\nWhen considering how to scope a feature for a release, remember that it is not ok to ship an ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù feature to customers (see the\ndefinition of done\n). Consider the use of Pajamas components for UI in your MVCs. When introducing a new component or pattern not found within Pajamas, it is the responsibility of that team to follow our\ncomponent lifecycle guidelines\nto\ndetermine whether it should be added\nand, if so, contribute the addition/update back to Pajamas.\nMVC means reducing the scope so we can ship quickly. It doesn‚Äôt mean shipping something that hurts the usability of GitLab. First impressions are important. A feature that does not offer enough value or hinders the user experience may have a negative effect that discourages users from trying that feature again in the future. If there are obvious gaps in your MVC or you can anticipate follow-up requests, consider whether your feature is complete enough to be released to users. If you are unsure whether your feature is complete enough to be an MVC (or if you know your feature is not complete enough to be an MVC and you want to gather additional feedback), you can use approaches such as dogfooding,\nbeta programs\n, feature flags, and/or user research to help build confidence in your decision. In terms of talking about your feature, it‚Äôs ok to add a release post item that announces your incomplete feature (making clear that it is an early iteration, and points to the direction for the feature) and follow up in a later release post with a new item when you‚Äôve completed more of the functionality. As long as you call it cookie dough, not a cookie, it manages user expectations.\nExamples:\nShip a feature through the API and not the UI -\nSee this release post\nas a great example of this approach was used to build a GraphQL endpoint for deleting attachment from a project.\nExposing a minimal set of functionality  -\nSee this release post\nwhere a basic read-only page displaying queued jobs was added and more capabilities were added in subsequent releases.\nThere are scenarios when an MVC approach is not advised. These include:\nWhen changing core parts of the experience - An example of a core experience is\ncomments\n. When building this out for work items, we waited to release the new feature to end users until we reached parity with comments in Issues and MRs.\nIteration\nAn MVC approach is a byproduct of our spirit of iteration. That means we\nbreak problems down\nas\nsmall as possible\n, and focus on\nreduced cycle time\n. Thinking iteratively is not always intuitive, and breaking certain topics or projects down can be challenging. Here‚Äôs a helpful\nvideo\nfrom our CEO with guidance on how to think more iteratively.\nHere is a\ngreat video\nthat illustrates how to build MVCs using Iteration. It shows Lego climbing obstacles. The first design fails. The second one can climb a book and so on. It also illustrates how modularity and good interfaces help with iteration as things get complex.\nIteration speed and product excellence\nTo ensure that our efforts consistently deliver value to our users, each iteration must adhere to the following guidelines:\nDefine Expected Impact: Clearly articulate the expected measurable positive impact of the iteration on users, ensuring alignment with our overall product direction and guided by a vision that has been informed by user research.\nEstablish Metrics for Success: Identify specific metrics that will be used to evaluate the success of the iteration before declaring the feature GA or an iteration shippable. These should be concrete, measurable indicators that directly relate to the intended outcomes of the iteration.\nThese metrics should define a measurable quality bar as part of the initial scoping as that allows the cross-functional team to understand what the success/quality criteria are before beginning to build, while also allowing these metrics to be measured during the entire development and post-release lifecycle. As part of defining the quality bar a test plan should be defined and agreed that it can measure against these measures for success. Quality targets include:\nNo S1 or blocking S2 defects/bug that prevents the customer from using the feature\nNot impacting or severely degrading the stability of the GitLab instance\nSuccess of an initiative is not measured by the deployment of a change or the completion of an iteration. True success is determined by whether the iteration achieved its predefined objectives, as evidenced by tangible business and product metrics.\nExample:\nEffort: Reduce latency in Service A.\nIteration A: Implement regional upgrades in key locations.\nSuccess Metrics: Evaluate the iteration‚Äôs success by measuring increased usage and user satisfaction with Service A. Relevant metrics might include service usage rates, user adoption levels, repeat usage statistics, and revenue increases following the upgrade.\nWe celebrate achievements when we can clearly see that an iteration or launch has resulted in tangible value for our users.\nSubtractive thinking\nHumans tend to\nfavor solutions that add features than solutions that remove them, even when removing features is more efficient\n- great PMs recognize this bias and utilize subtractive thinking to create great user experiences. Customers will tell us when we‚Äôre missing something they need, but they‚Äôre unlikely to explicitly tell us when we‚Äôre overwhelming them with unwanted features. However, we do have evidence that this challenge is already a consideration for us, as reflected consistently in our\nSystem Usability Scale verbatims\n. Here is\nan episode on the Hidden Brain podcast\nthat explores this bias further.\nSaaS First\nOur customers choose SaaS because it reduces their operating costs, helps them adopt the latest capabilities without performing upgrades, and provides them peace of mind of high availability. This principle implies the following:\nDesign features so that they can be released without downtime.\nRelease features in SaaS before self-managed or alongside it.\nThis principle does not mean SaaS only. For more information on parity between SaaS and self-managed, see our\nparity principle\n.\nFeedback issues\nAn MVC approach allows for maximum feedback while iterating. To help gather that feedback, Product Managers are encouraged to create feedback issues (\nexample\n) to consolidate suggestions and experiences from users. Consider mentioning the feedback issue in any release post items and related implementation issue(s) for awareness.\nFeedback issues allow GitLab team members and the wider GitLab community to offer thoughts and suggestions for future iteration.\nFeedback issues are particularly encouraged for major new customer-facing features.\nThese issues can be closed at the end of the milestone following the milestone when they were introduced.\nCelebrate and Learn from Failures\nIt‚Äôs important that team members know they are encouraged by E-group to continue moving fast as GitLab grows and gets bigger as a company. This involves moving quickly even in the face of risk and complexity. In alignment with our\ntransparency value\n, we‚Äôd like to celebrate examples of failures or mistakes that were made while moving fast, where we ultimately learned from it and moved on.\nThe following failures provided by the product team are celebrated as opportunities to gain insight, share learnings and move on with additional knowledge:\nWe initially believed we should create a lift and shift translator for Jenkins, but learned from users and technical experts that it wasn‚Äôt technically feasible and it would be better to invest in more detailed documentation and guidance.\nWith Auto DevOps, we discovered the desire for composability and the need to iterate on your DevOps platform makes a one-pipeline fits all capability miss the mark for tackling that user pain.\nWe integrated with some monitoring and observability tools as MVCs (Jaeger) that were just too MVC to give us data points on their success.\nWe relied upon ‚ÄúMVC‚Äù not including on by default and usable by default - resulting in lots of MVCs that we thought would garner us new information, but did not.\nWe spent time delivering a marketplace offering, and had very little traction. We learned marketplace offerings alone are not a vehicle for adoption, and we need a sales alignment with the marketplace vendor to achieve success.\nWe had duplication of effort between Quality and Distribution. We didn‚Äôt recognize / resolve this for too long. We have learned to better integrate Quality into the planning process.\nData telemetry in general has been one of our failures. We didn‚Äôt invest in telemetry seriously or early enough, and we attempted to accelerate via a 3rd party, but didn‚Äôt do a good enough job talking to our community on the best ways to roll that out.\nWe failed to capture significant users with APM.\nInternal Deck for Reference\nHistorically, designers had been instructed to not spend time on problem validation, but we had a PM who realized in order for her group to be successful, she needed her design counterpart to be deeply involved in validation work.\nWe learned that GitLab‚Äôs original Serverless strategy was dependent on immature technology and not necessarily aligned with the market winner Lambda. This resulted in GitLab stopping investment in Serverless.\nWe recognized a big gap in security concerns with GitLab managed clusters, which was prohibiting this feature from being adopted by customers. Once we learned from this ‚Äòfailure‚Äô we introduced the Kubernetes agent instead.\nIf you have a failure that can serve as a learning opportunity, please make an MR to this page\nAvoid ‚ÄúNot Invented Here‚Äù Syndrome\nJust because something is\nnot invented here\ndoesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt have a perfect home within our solution. GitLab is an\nOpen Core product and is part of the broader ecosystem of Open Source tools in\nthe market. Every day there are new innovative open source tools out there that solve\nreal-world customer problems; we should not be afraid of embedding these tools\ninto our own products in order to solve those same problems for our customers\ntoo. Leveraging existing technology allows us to get to market much more quickly,\nto contribute to Open Source (and help strengthen Open Source as a whole), and\nallows us to focus our own people on making GitLab itself better. Building\nprofessional relationships with these tool creators also is a positive for GitLab\nsince they may have important user perspectives around your categories.\nWe have achieved many successes following this approach:\nCode Quality\nin CI/CD pipelines by embedding\nCodeClimate\nFeature Flags\nby using the\nUnleash\nclient library\nMobile publishing\nby writing about how to utilize\nFastLane\nwith GitLab\nThere are also many more examples throughout the company where this has been successful.\nAs a product manager you should be monitoring the world of Open Source as it\nrelates to your area to see where new innovative tools are being developed, and\nnot be afraid of integrating those. One thing to keep in mind, integrating could\nbe anything from a blog post describing how the tool works together with GitLab\nall the way up to bundling it inside of our own installation, and this can\nevolve iteratively.\nConvention over Configuration\nWe understand that a natural inclination when using application development tools is to create an array of buttons to press and knobs to turn. We believe, however, that adding options to an application does not necessarily improve the user‚Äôs experience of that application. The best way to serve our users is to create an application that reduces complexity while still offering the features they need.\nInspiration\nWe admire other ‚Äúconvention over configuration‚Äù tools‚Äîlike\nRuby on Rails\n(the doctrine of which perfectly describes the\nvalue of integrated systems\n),\nEmber\n, and\nHeroku\n‚Äîand we strive to offer the same advantages for continuous delivery of software.\nFurthermore, Ruby on Rails has significantly and positively influenced the Ruby community, uplifting the tool and making it more powerful and useful than ever before. We want GitLab to be to Kubernetes what Rails is to Ruby.\nYou should prefer well-considered choices based on current best practices. Avoid unnecessary configuration. Avoid configuration to support fragile workflows.\nConfiguration Principles\nWhen considering adding new configuration, we follow the following principles:\nEnsure a great experience by default\n- GitLab should work perfectly right out of the box for most users. While it should be resisted, sometimes configuration is inevitable or preferable. Your configuration must not make that\nexperience worse\nand should always\nget out of the way of the user\n.\nGitLab.com values should be the default\n- the settings used on GitLab.com should be the defaults for self-managed. Not only does this provide a consistent experience for users, but we get the highest fidelity feedback via GitLab.com. If we find that the GitLab.com setting is wrong, it is usually wrong for self-managed too. If you believe you have a strong case for using custom (non-default) settings for GitLab.com, please document the justification in alignment with your Product Section Lead. Any custom (non-default) settings for GitLab.com need to be\ntracked here\n.\nEncourage favorable behaviors by limiting configuration\n- Convention also implies that we‚Äôre encouraging our customers to do things\nin a certain way. A very concrete example of this is the ability to disable pipelines. We believe that our integrated solution will give a superior user experience and we‚Äôre motivated to encourage this behavior. For this reason, adding a configuration to allow disabling this permanently (be that in a template or instance-wide), is something that should be avoided.\nDesign for users not intermediaries\n- GitLab should avoid falling into the\nBlackboard trap\nof building a product that administrators of GitLab love because it is configurable, but developers and other users of GitLab hate because it is overly complex and confusing.\nWorking by Default\n- From the perspective of someone using GitLab, the feature does not exist until it works by default. This means, with few exceptions, features should simply work on GitLab.com and self-managed installations of GitLab without setup, toggling feature flags, modifying GitLab Omnibus (\ngitlab.rb\n) or Charts configurations, or installing extra components. This is more difficult than ‚Äúenabled by default,‚Äù which implies that features may be available by default but then require additional effort to set up. Working by default is worth the extra thoughtfulness and effort, because it enables an extremely important outcome: It allows customers to easily adopt our entire platform and experience the benefits of a single app for the entire DevOps lifecycle. In order to be properly working by default a feature needs two things:\nEnabled-by-default\n- it must not require modifying GitLab Omnibus (\ngitlab.rb\n) or Charts configurations, installing extra components on the host machine, or be behind a feature flag. When features are not enabled-by-default most people will never benefit from it because admin access to the GitLab application or the host machine will be needed. Feature flags should be consistently ON for both GitLab.com and self-managed users whenever possible.\nEnabled-by-default can be rolled out incrementally. A feature can sometimes be activated within days via a feature flag on\nGitLab.com\n. Other times a feature can take months to prove that it has the performance and visibility enterprises need.\nSetup-by-default\n- it should not require the setup before the feature can be used. We should ensure every feature has sensible defaults, and automatically migrate existing users/groups/projects to have the new features setup by default, while ensuring that the security and infrastructure costs would not be substantially affected. It is important to remember that most people are not likely to take the extra effort to setup a new feature, nor will they be aware that the feature has been added. The vocal proponents of issues who a Product Manager might interact with would likely be inclined to take the extra effort to setup a feature, but most people will not.\nAvoid Limits\n- Limits should be in place to\nprotect the system\nbut not to ‚Äúslowly try out‚Äù a feature. By limiting the usefulness of a feature right from the start the only thing you are achieving is limiting its adoption and usefulness. If you are going to default to OFF or limited, you must have a good, documented reason for this.\nAvoid configuration completely when possible\n- Requests for configuration can be a proxy for trying to support a fragile workflow. Rather than enabling bad habits and incurring product debt, effort should be spent helping customers adopt best practices.\nConfiguration builds up over time\n- Every configuration option in GitLab multiplies its complexity, which means the application is harder to use, harder to develop, and less friendly to users.\nConfiguration is hard to remove\n- Removing a configuration after it shipped and in use is much more work than not introducing it in the first place. This is because you change the behavior for customers that selected the less popular option.\nConfiguration is an expensive testing mechanism\n- It‚Äôs a natural reaction to propose a big change to be configurable, as you worry it‚Äôll negatively affect certain users. However, by making a feature configurable, you‚Äôve now created\ntwo problems\nto maintain going forward. Adding a configuration is a\none way door\nthat should be avoided if possible. As a result, consider using feature flags instead of configuration.\nAlways Allow for Deploying to Production\nSometimes fast deployments are needed to fix a service or application outage that can cost a business money and reputation, we understand time is of the essence in these situations. That‚Äôs why we believe giving the team control over this is important in crucial moments of the development lifecycle. Controls that prevent changes from reaching Production are okay as safeguards, but they should be able to be quickly removed or disabled if necessary. When controls are changed in this way, logs or records should be created to support post-mortem analysis and allow for understanding why the control needed to be removed or disabled.\nDesign for self-managed for feature parity between deployments\nWe want to provide the same capabilities to end users regardless of the method they choose to use GitLab (GitLab SaaS, Dedicated or Self-managed). All GitLab SaaS environments leverage the same installation method available to self-managed users, with a different licensing structure. By designing and implementing features for self-managed, we achieve maximum parity between the various installations.\nA few examples:\nDesign features to avoid downtime since it‚Äôs not acceptable for SaaS nor self-managed users.\nIt is ok to release functionality to SaaS first, as long as the solution is applicable for self-managed too.\nWhile a feature can be enabled first on SaaS via a\nfeature flag\nor setting, the underlying implementation must also exist, although disabled, on self-managed.\nIn line with our\nSaaS-first\nprinciple, some features may be released on SaaS to gain operational experience and apply learnings prior to recommending and supporting customers using it. Features would be present on self-managed codebase but are disabled until General Availability.\nFor functionality where implementation may be especially challenging without cloud services, for example with AI, self-managed functionality may be dependent on an underlying SaaS service. This allows us to provide end users the same capabilities regardless of deployment type, and not overly constrain our feature set or impose significant operational complexities on each deployment. Product managers need to be aware that this may impact the adoption of these features, as not all customers may be willing or able to leverage underlying SaaS services, such as air-gapped deployments.\nPrincipled adherence to the established knowledge architecture\nException to this product principle requires CEO approval. Work with VP, Product Management to add your request to the Product Scale agenda describing the situation and request for exception to gain CEO approval.\nOur\nsimplicity\nand\nSaaS/Self-Managed Parity\nprinciples require that we adhere to our established knowledge architecture. Our established architecture is\nOrganization\n,\nGroup\nand\nProject\n.\nWhen we need to add capabilities that an admin needs to apply across the entire organization, then we provide them at the organization level.\nWhen we need to add capabilities that need to apply across all projects in a group, but not applicable to all groups in an organization, then we provide them at a group level.\nWhen we need to add capabilities that need to apply across a specific project, but not all projects in a group, then we provide them at a project level.\nFor capabilities our users want applied to a set of groups, it is tempting to create another aggregation concept for a ‚Äúset of groups‚Äù. We do not consider that until it is available both at the project and group level for a few months. The solution is to implement it for all groups at the organization level or for each group in the set individually.\nFor capabilities our users want applied to a set of projects, it is tempting to create another aggregation concept for a ‚Äúset of projects‚Äù. We do not consider that until it is available both at the project and group level for a few months. The solution is to implement it for all projects at the group level or for each project in the set individually.\nNote: This implies that we will take pains to avoid instance-level features as we expect to move all capabilities from instance to organization over time.\nTake pains to avoid instance-level features\nAfter making a tier decision on a new feature, we should strive to maximize the number of users who can use it.\nAs part of this objective, we should avoid building instance-level features when possible. Building at the instance level (in the\nadmin area\n) leads to\na separation between GitLab.com and self-managed\nand limits\nyour audience to self-managed customers only:\nHistorically (and even net-new proposed features) we‚Äôve often started with an ‚Äúinstance-wide‚Äù mindset which then means we need to iterate and adjust features to work at a group-level. This often delays functionality for our SaaS customers and makes GitLab.COM feel like a second-class citizen.\nThere are factors that may justify an instance-level feature, like\nengineering efficiency\nand\nhigh infrastructure cost\n, but we should always have a clear view on how we might bring the feature to GitLab.com and clearly document why we started with the instance-level in the issue.\nDeciding whether to add configuration\nFor a GitLab instance in\ngitlab.yml\nProduct Managers at GitLab are frequently confronted with the choice of whether to add new configurations or not. These can frequently be times where an outside perspective is important. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve created the option to request a\nNew Config Review\n.\nHere‚Äôs an example of how to consider whether to add new configuration. Let‚Äôs say you are proposing we add a checkbox or two radio boxes in a feature dialog box. Think carefully about what users really want. Most of the time, you‚Äôll find you really only need one solution, so remove the other option. When two possible choices really are necessary, the best or most common one should be the default, and the other one\nshould be available. If the non-default choices are significantly less common, then consider taking them out of the main workflow for making decisions, by putting them behind an Advanced configuration tab, for example.\nAvoiding configurations is not always possible. When we have no choice,\nthe secondary priority is to configure something in the GitLab\ninterface.\nA configuration should only appear in a file (\ngitlab.rb\nor\ngitlab.yml\n) as a last resort.\ngitlab.yml\nis the configuration file used by the Rails application. This is where the domain is configured. Other configurations should be moved to the UI as much as possible and no new configurations should be added here.\ngitlab.rb\nis the configuration file for Omnibus-GitLab. It acts not only as\nan abstraction of the configuration of\ngitlab.yml\nfor GitLab-Rails, but also\nas the source for\nall configurations\nfor services included and managed within\nthe Omnibus-GitLab. Newly introduced services probably need to be configured\nhere.\nWhen you have to add a new configuration, make sure that the features and services are on by default. Only add a configuration line to either of these configuration files if the feature or service cannot be fully disabled from the admin UI.\nFor a GitLab CI configuration in\n.gitlab-ci.yml\nIf the decision to add a configuration follows the\nprinciples above\n, add it to the repository-specific CI configuration options and be sure to default it to the option that results in the best user experience. We are much more liberal with additions to CI configurations than Instance configurations.\nEvery feature is owned by a group\nFeatures should be owned by one group, including the respective DRIs of that group. Make sure that the documentation metadata and the\nfeatures.yml\nfor your team are kept up to date to make it easier for other teams to find the correct owner.\nThis principle is important because unowned product features are unsupervised, and continue to accrue technical debt over time. This increases the risk of performance and maintenance issues, which tend to only get resolved once the situation has become critical. In addition, by having clear DRIs for our entire surface area, teams are able to advocate for investment and/or removal of features. If you encounter a feature that does not seem to be owned or documented, work with the team that originally introduced the functionality to decide on ownership. If the feature is large and needs to be broken down, document which elements are owned by which team. If you cannot decide who should own the feature, escalate the decision to the lowest common reporting line between the involved teams. If there are features that no group wants to own, or features that a group no longer wants to own, that feature should be considered for deprecation and removal.\nUser Experience\nA highly usable interface with cohesive workflows and comprehensive documentation is a must to stay ahead of our best-in-class competitors. Work closely with the individuals in\nto achieve our user experience goals. The UX team has a high level of expertise in Product Design, Technical Writing, and UX Research. They can help decipher or decide how to simplify or avoid complexity. While our Product Designers\nreview user interface changes in merge requests\n, they are not limited to just the UI. Anything that impacts the user journey is relevant to them.\nKeep in mind these general user experience principles.\nStrive for simplicity:\nUsing GitLab should be easy. Users should think about the applications they are building and the teams they are collaborating with, not how to make our app work. Here‚Äôs a great read on\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make users think!‚Äù\nDepth over breadth:\nA world-class experience requires deep, powerful, useful features. To remain balanced, we must also identify capabilities that can be deprecated so we are adding depth while encouraging\nsubtractive thinking\n.\nBetter than before:\nOur\nMVC principle\npushes back against the notion that something must be better than nothing. Instead, we assess if the user experience is better than before by considering its value. Work with a Product Designer to evaluate tradeoffs and minimize\ndeferred UX\n.\nTimeless design:\nThe user experience should be relevant both today and years from now, so each release should encapsulate the best experience possible. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow would we build something if we knew this was the last time a team could touch it?‚Äù\nAdditionally, you can familiarize yourself with the\nUX team mission\nand\nGitLab‚Äôs Pajamas design system principles\n.\nBe Ambitious\nMany crazy, over-ambitious ideas sound like they are impossible just\nbecause no one else is doing them.\nSince we have amazing engineers and a culture of shipping minimal\nvaluable changes, we are able to accomplish many more ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù things than other organizations.\nThat‚Äôs why we‚Äôre shipping merge conflict resolution, why we shipped built-in CI\nbefore anyone else, why we built a better static pages solution, and why\nwe‚Äôre able to compete.\nHow this impacts Planning\nHere at GitLab, we are an\nambitious\ncompany and this means we\naim for big things with every release. The reality of taking chances and\nplanning aspirationally means that we won‚Äôt always be able to deliver everything\nthat we wanted to try in every release, and similar to our\nOKRs\n,\nwe believe this is a good thing. We don‚Äôt want to shy away from challenging\nourselves and always want to keep a sense of urgency, and aiming for more helps\nus do that. Also see\nthe importance of velocity\nWe arrived at our preference for ambitious planning after measuring our velocity and finding that our velocity was unchanged whether we scheduled ambitiously or scheduled for providing slack.\nDiscoverability without being annoying\nDiscovering new features can enhance the experience and unlock significant value for users. And the more users see and try our features, the faster we can get feedback to improve them.\nHowever, excessive feature discovery efforts can become irritating for users. This erodes trust and reduces engagement with other UI elements in the future. Even worse, they might leave GitLab due to this deteriorating experience. Context plays a significant role in how users engage with new functionality. By presenting features in a way that resonates with a user‚Äôs current situation and needs you increase the liklihood of them using this new functionality.\nWork with your product designer to improve the discoverability of your features. The Pajamas Design System has best practices and examples to support\nfeature discoverability\n. We can also design new patterns. The Growth team can also help you with this, as they think about things like onboarding new users and promoting feature use within the app while supporting, not annoying, the user.\nProduct Qualified Leads (PQLs)\nAs the GitLab userbase and team members who work on GitLab continue to grow we need to support both our users and team members by helping to connect users who may be interested in speaking with a member of the sales team to that particular person. We can call this a Product Qualified Lead or a PQL.\nA PQL can be further broken down into two types, usage and hand-raise\nUsage: A usage-based PQL is a user or a team (group or instance) that adopted the product to the level that we had data to support that they are statistically more likely to upgrade to a subscription compared to our remaining userbase. When this level of product adoption is achieved by the user or team an alert is triggered for the sales team to follow up with the user and/or team. The level of usage that triggers a usage-based PQL is something that will be determined and agreed upon between Product, Marketing, and Sales as the goal is to generate quality leads for the sales team. When the usage-based definition is agreed upon it will be added here.\nHand-Raise: A hand-raise PQL is a user who requests to speak to sales from within the product. Our goal is to introduce these hand-raise moments throughout the product at feature discovery moments, or moments where a user is learning more about a paid feature or tier of GitLab that they may find valuable. These moments should be contextually relevant to their usage and non-obtrusive\nsee Discoverability Without Being Annoying\n. A hand-raise moment in the product should be accompanied by either a trial CTA or a touchless upgrade CTA or both. We want to always provide options to our users as we want them to decide the path that best suits their needs.\nClarifiying out what a PQL is not\nA PQL is not a user that has only signed up for the product, they have not achieved a qualified status.\nA PQL is not a trial, a trial is a separate user adoption path. It‚Äôs important to note that a user could start a trial and then become a PQL or vice versa.\nThe future vision of PQLs within the GitLab product\nOur goal is to develop a world-class PQL system whereby we monitor product usage to understand and constantly iterate on what constitutes a usage-based PQL and provide a unified intelligent interface in the product where users can submit a hand-raise, start a trial or upgrade touchlessly.\nBy monitoring product usage, usage PQL volume, SAO rate, and ASP we will be able to work in partnership with marketing and sales to ensure we‚Äôre sending high quality leads to the sales team.\nIn the product experience, we will develop an intelligent module for feature discovery moments whereby we help recommend what we believe should be the preferred option for the user whether it‚Äôs a hand-raise, trial or touchless upgrade by updating the default CTA based on their usage of the product along with demographic and firmographic data. This experience will be present on both SaaS and self-managed instances for air-gapped instances the CTAs will provide the user with external URLs to visit to complete the associated step. This experience should be able to be deployed by any stage to further their paid adoption rate.\nDrive Product Usage\nUsers can only experience GitLab‚Äôs value when they actively use the product features. Therefore the Product team‚Äôs mission isn‚Äôt only shipping features and building products, but also driving usage and delivering value.\nThere are two frameworks we use to think about driving GitLab‚Äôs product usage: we use the AARRR framework to think about how to drive a single feature‚Äôs usage, and use the Customer Adoption Journey to think about cross-adoption of product features. These two frameworks are also interconnected with each other.\nSingle Feature usage: AARRR framework\nAARRR stands for\nAcquisition\n,\nActivation\n,\nRetention\n,\nRevenue\n, and\nReferral\nwhich is often referred to as\n‚ÄúPirate Metrics‚Äù\n. These five words represent the customer journey and the various means a product manager may apply Product Performance Indicators to drive a desired behavior in the funnel.\nWhile the AARRR framework is commonly used to drive overall active users, it is also a great way for PMs to think about how to drive feature usage.\nAcquisition measures user actions that show awareness of the feature\nActivation illustrates a user has begun to apply the feature\nRetention is the continued use of the feature over time\nRevenue captures the monetary value acquired from feature usage\nReferral focuses on measuring behaviors that drive users to encourage others to consume the feature\nclassDiagram\nAcquistion : Are users aware of the product or feature set?\nAcquistion: Measurement (Insert Metric)\nActivation : Are users applying the feature?\nActivation: Measurement (Insert Metric)\nRetention : Are users applying the feature over time?\nRetention: Measurement (Insert Metric)\nRevenue : Are users paying for the features?\nRevenue: Measurement (Insert Metric)\nReferral : Are users encouraging others to use the feature?\nReferral: Measurement (Insert Metric)\nAdd AARRR funnels for your stage or group‚Äôs Product Performance Indicators directly with mermaid markdown. It‚Äôs easy if you use this\nlive editor\n.\nProduct managers can use these various states to prioritize features that drive a desired action. This could mean focusing on the Activation metric to drive awareness and generate more\ntop of funnel\nleads. As an example, in the\nRelease stage\nthe Release Management group tracks actions on the Release Page in GitLab. Users that view a Release Page have been\nacquired\nand those that create a release on a Release Page are\nactivated\nusers. The Product Manager can choose to target features that drive users to view the Release Page more, resulting in a greater interest in the number of users that become activated and create their own Releases.\nMulti-feature usage: Adoption Journey\nGitLab is a complete DevOps platform. Our customers get the most value out of the GitLab product when they use multiple features together. Below is the most common path our customers follow to adopt GitLab‚Äôs product stages.\nAs PMs, in addition to driving usage of individual features, we should also proactively think about how to design product and user experiences to help users adopt more stages and features, therefore benefiting more from using GitLab.\ngraph TD;\nid1(Create - 99%) --> id2(Plan - 91%)\nid3(Verify - 84%) --> id4(Secure - 36%)\nid1 --> id5(Manage - 35%)\nid3 --> id7(Package - 7%)\nid6 --> id9(Monitor - 8%)\nid6 --> id10(Configure - 2%)\nid6 --> id11(Software Supply Chain Security - 28%)\nThe percentage here is defined as % of monthly active paid ultimate-tier self-managed instances that adopted that stage. The data is captured directly in the Golden Journey Paths chart (which has been deprecated).\nThe Golden Journey: The bolded path is the ‚ÄúGolden Journey‚Äù where we observe as the most common stages adopted by paid customers and serve as foundation to adopt other stages: it starts from Create, then goes to Verify and Release. If the Golden Journey is complete, all stages of GitLab are available for use. Our biggest opportunity is to improve Verify to Release adoption rate.\nNote: There are numerous potential variants to this adoption journey, but it‚Äôs important to keep this representation simple and consistent. Please check with David DeSanto first before making any changes to the adoption journey image.\nFlow One\nShipping only MVCs can result in a large set of loosely connected pieces that\ndon‚Äôt necessarily combine into a single, great user experience.\nAn obvious solution to this would be to plan out the future in detail,\ncreating a long-term detailed plan. However, this is unwanted as it can restrict\nyour flexibility and ability to respond to changing needs or feedback.\nFlow One offers an alternative. You draw out a workflow consisting of\nMVCs (that can be shipped individually). The workflow should only cover a\nspecific, narrow use-case, and nothing more.\nThis means you:\navoid creating an inflexible, long-term plan\ncan more easily construct a full feature/ capability, which is more easily marketed\ncan provide context to each individual change (‚Äúwe need this as part of X‚Äù)\ncan continue to ship MVCs\nwork concurrently on several items, none of which are blocking\nFlow One should cover the first iteration of a particular workflow.\nAfter this, individual MVCs can be introduced to expand the use-cases\nor loosen the assumptions (e.g. from a feature that can only be used\nif you‚Äôre using feature branches, to one that works for other git strategies).\nData-driven work\nUsing data to learn from our users is important. Our users are spread across GitLab.com\nand self-managed instances, so we have to focus our efforts on learning and\nproviding benefit to both when we decide to collect more data, or build and use\nadditional analytics tools. If we do this, we can help make the rest of the\ncompany successful as well. This means that we should:\nBuild and use tools that work for both GitLab.com and self-managed.\nStart from a question, and build / collect what we need to answer that question. This avoids wasting time with data we don‚Äôt need.\nUse and improve existing tools we have inside of GitLab before leaning towards off-the-shelf products.\nOur customers, sales team and customer success teams all benefit greatly from similar insights into their usage as the product team does. Make things that help all of these people.\nNo artificial limits in Core\nPer\nGitLab Stewardship\n, we will not introduce\nartificial\nlimits in Core. Artificial means\narbitrarily setting a small number (such as: 1) as a limit on a given GitLab object category,\nthat would incur\nno additional\neffort or cost had we chosen a larger number. The additional\neffort includes product, design, and engineering effort to create the feature in the first place,\nand to maintain it over time.\nFor example, GitLab Core has the\nissue board feature\nin every project.\nIn GitLab EE, each project supports\nmultiple boards\n.\nThis\ndoes not\nmean that Core has an artificial limit of one board per project, because there is additional effort\nto manage multiple boards such as supporting the navigation interface, and all the associated engineering work.\nThis principle does not apply to our SaaS offering as limits are occasionally introduced to limit our hosting costs and protect other users from potential abuse. As an example we have\nshared runner\nminute quotas and implement\nrate limiting\n.\nAvoid enforced workflows but allow enterprise flexibility\nWe‚Äôre discussing enforced workflows\nin this issue\n.\nEnforced workflows should be avoided in GitLab. For example, there are three issue\nstates (\nOpen\n,\nIn Progress\n(as of 10.2), and\nClosed\n), and any issue should be\nallowed to transition from one state to any other state\nwithout workflow restrictions. (Roles and permissions is a separate concern.)\nEnforced workflows restrict GitLab to a smaller number of use cases, thus reducing the value of GitLab.\nEnforced workflows require overhead to maintain in the product. Each new feature\nmust account for any existing enforced workflows.\nWe should trust our users to use GitLab responsibly, giving them freedom, instead\nof imposing enforced workflows that we think made sense at the time of design and implementation.\nA comment on Hacker News\nperfectly details what can go wrong when enforcing workflows:\n‚ÄúThe down side for the true end-users, those who actually use the software day-to-day,\nis that most business processes are awful. If your experience is the hellish existence\nthat I see strolled about on threads where JIRA comes up ‚Ä¶:\nYour admin(s) set it up once and hasn‚Äôt bothered to iterate on those workflows.\nThe business mapped their autonomy stripping processes onto JIRA intentionally.\nI‚Äôd guess that most of your work experience is similar. Process stifled nonsense.‚Äù\nBut that comment also specifies the advantage:\n‚ÄúJIRA‚Äôs most powerful feature is that it affords for mapping businesses processes onto software.\nThis is incredibly compelling to enterprise customers. Software that enforces workflows, procedures\nand requirements can be an incredible lever and JIRA‚Äôs price point makes build vs buy decisions an absolute no-brainer.‚Äù\nWe should ensure that GitLab makes it easy to help with enterprise workflows:\nWhen starting a branch with an issue (number) we link it to the branch.\nWhen merging an MR you automatically close the issue(s) it fixes.\nIn GitLab CI you can define your deployment stage progression (staging, pre-production, production) including manual approval.\nWe run quality and security tools automatically and provide dashboards to check status instead of making it a step in the process.\nWe limit the impact of mistakes with incremental rollout and automatic rollback.\nWhen considering a customer need for enforcement or limitations:\nDeeply understand and document the underlying customer problem. It‚Äôs our responsibility to understand the need we are solving for before we even consider imposing controls.\nSolve for individual use cases first. Trying to solve a specific problem with a non-specific solution is risky and not\niterative\n. Instead, start with a single use case and build a specific, non-enforced solution in GitLab.\nConsider the smallest group of users first. Don‚Äôt reach for instance-wide controls, but instead iterate from the smallest segment possible (e.g. a sub-set of projects).\nProvide simple workarounds and overrides. Consider extreme scenarios like recovering from a SEV-1 incident; there should always be a simple, fast escape hatch.\nAs an example, customers requested instance-wide enforcement through required CI jobs. Doing this would have been a mistake. Instead:\nWe understood their problem more deeply, and realized we could build capabilities to perform these checks in existing primitives (like\nexternal rules\nin MR approvals).\nWe limited the scope of the problem, and avoided any limitations at the instance-level. Instead, we planned to keep the impact as small as possible by requiring customers to scope this feature to only projects with a particular\ncompliance framework\n.\nWe intentionally planned for workarounds. A developer should be able to override these limitations inside merge requests, such as with\ntwo-person approvals\n. They should also be able to create subgroups that aren‚Äôt subject to these controls.\nWhile workflow enforcement should be avoided in most cases, there are organizations that rely on enforced workflows for a variety of reasons. These organizations have problems adapting existing workflows as they move to GitLab and as a result, we should consider allowing some enforcement at the group level in order to balance team efficiency and organizational policy. Page 79 of [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) outlines \"teams that reported no approval process or used peer review achieved higher software delivery performance.\" As we implement features to allow organizations to enforce workflows, we should do so at the group level and default them off. GitLab should be a product teams use to accelerate product development, but flexible enough to solve for requirements of all sizes of organizations.\nPrefer small primitives\nSmall primitives are building blocks in GitLab. They are an abstraction\nnot\nat\nthe technical level, but truly at the product level. Small primitives can be combined,\nbuilt-upon further, and otherwise leveraged to create new functionality in GitLab.\nFor example, the label lists in\nissue boards\nuse the smaller primitive of\nlabels\n.\nThey are especially powerful because they usually take less effort\nand\nprovide\nhigher leverage than you would get from a more ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù but standalone feature.\nThink of how simple Unix command line utilities can be chained together to do\nreally complicated things, much easier (and certainly more flexibly) than you\ncould have done with a dedicated tool.\nWhen iterating on GitLab, strongly consider using small primitives instead\nof creating new abstractions, especially when considering MVC features\nthat will provide the foundations for further improvements. To do this\nyou can start with easy to apply concepts that meet the needs of intermediate\nto advanced users; from here document the usage clearly and be sure to think about\ndiscoverability. The UX can very often be refactored or enhanced later when there‚Äôs\na demonstrated need for refinement, onboarding for less sophisticated users, or\nother new abstractions needed that were identified through real-world usage.\nComponent Principles\nIn GitLab the product, it is sometimes the case that optional software or infrastructure is required to enable new capabilities. Some examples include:\nInfrastructure in the form of Runners are required to enable use of GitLab CI/CD\nInfrastructure and software in the form of Elasticsearch is required to enable Advanced Search\nSoftware in the form of the Kubernetes Agent is required to enable GitOps pull-based workflows\nThe following are best practices we consider when building such components.\nStart with enabling Developers\nAs we learned with GitLab CI/CD, the ability for developers to quickly attach needed Runners to enable their own use of GitLab CI/CD allowed for rapid adoption of GitLab CI/CD within an organization. When considering the workflow to enable additional capabilities, start with enabling developers first. A guiding principle should be\nlow-friction\ndeveloper enablement, which will positively impact adoption.\nBuild for production use, not demo use\nAs we learned from the certificate-based Kubernetes Integration, building starting experiences that support demoing a getting-started process doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate into real usage. For example, the certificate-based integration lacked strong security primitives and the ability to manage the integration on an ongoing basis. As a result, we should build capabilities that target real-world production use first, even as part of MVCs.\nIntegrate other applications thoughtfully\nGitLab‚Äôs vision is to be the best single application for every part of the DevOps toolchain. However, some customers use tools other than our included features, and we respect those decisions. With this in mind, it‚Äôs sometimes valuable to integrate with 3rd-party services and products to help\nbridge the gaps\nin their toolchain. While a single application is the best approach, multiple applications that work well together is better than ones that don‚Äôt.\nWith this in mind, below are some product guidelines to consider:\nDon‚Äôt clone everything\nDon‚Äôt feel like we need to\nclone every feature\nof an integrated product. Ultimately, this approach costs us the most possible resources, while creating an experience that will always be sub-par compared to the native one offered by the other application. We should focus our efforts on places where we can deliver value by helping bridge the gap between the two applications.\nHere are some potential (completely theoretical) examples, highlighting the difference between cloning vs. bridging:\nIn an event log, surface only recent activity and link to a full log on the other system, instead of trying to display all records inside of GitLab.\nIn an issue/ticket, offer only the most used functionality, like commenting or status changes, instead of trying to replicate all possible actions.\nPrevent broken workflows for free\nBased on the quote above:\n‚ÄúWhile a single application is the best approach, multiple applications that work well together is better than ones that don‚Äôt.‚Äù\nFeatures and UX that might break a customers workflow should be offered freely. In particular, we should offer features that help customers avoid productivity antipatterns like allowing multiple sources of truth (multiple wikis) or duplicating work (not showing work activity on an issue).\nCharge for adding value to an interaction\nBy having such an incredible breadth, GitLab has\nthe opportunity to add value to external features that they could never otherwise have\n, if not integrated with GitLab. For example, our excellent\nTo Dos\nfeature puts actionable work at the fingertips of developers, and it‚Äôs a feature somewhat unique to GitLab. Many other tools make it harder to identify work that needs immediate action, so by integrating those tools with this part of GitLab,\nwe can make them even more powerful than they‚Äôd be alone.\nConsider the right buyer for pricing\nWhile we typically think about who is\nusing the functionality\nas an indicator of our buyer, this may not be appropriate for your integration.\nWhen an integration is driven by an organizational requirement (such as having all teams in the company use Jira),\nBuyer Based Tiering\nlikely indicates that the integration is for\nmultiple team\n(Premium) or\nstrategic organizational\n(Ultimate) use.\nWhen an integration is\nextending GitLab capabilities\n, the buyer is more likely to be the end-user, similar to how we‚Äôd think about pricing other GitLab functionality.\nLow level of shame still applies here\nWhen we start to integrate with another product, it‚Äôs almost like opening a whole new Category of work. With this in mind, a friendly reminder that\nlow level of shame\napplies, just like it would anywhere else. The integration may not be very valuable\ntoday\n, but it‚Äôs just a starting place, and we should use our first iteration to validate what belongs in the next one.\nTrack the maturity of the integration\nLike any other category of work, we should track the maturity of the integration somewhere that‚Äôs visible. Consider adding your integration to the Ecosystem Integrations direction page, which contains a table that tracks our high-priority integrations and their maturity levels.\nRespect security and permissions\nExternal applications may have security and permissions concerns that we don‚Äôt have in our application. We should take careful consideration of these, since ignoring them could be potentially disastrous for our users. For example, if we ask a user for an administrative token with full access and then display content in our UI based on those privileges, we could potentially display sensitive data that shouldn‚Äôt leave that application.\nNavigation\nIntegrations should be as discoverable as any native GitLab feature, if they‚Äôre enabled. In cases where the two features are mutually exclusive, we should allow the user to hide our native functionality to prevent confusion. For example, having two project management tools is a (generally)\nbad\nidea. Collaborators may end up filing issues in the wrong tool, slowing down their velocity and worsening their overall experience. Reducing velocity is antithetical to the value GitLab provides.\nWhen features\naren‚Äôt\nmutually exclusive (there‚Äôs nothing wrong with using\nmultiple\nsecurity scanning services, for example), we should group navigation to those integrations near our own.\nUse empty states for feature discovery\nConsider adding an\nempty state\nthat highlights the availability of this integration. If someone is not using the GitLab feature\nand also not\nintegrating their tool of choice, that‚Äôs the worst possible experience. We should respect the choices of our users, and if they‚Äôve decided to use a 3rd-party tool that we integrate with, we shouldn‚Äôt hide that option in a dark corner.\nThis is also a great opportunity to educate the user on what GitLab can offer relative to other products. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds: promoting our own features while helping them improve their current experience, regardless of choice.\nUse our own design language\nJust because we‚Äôre leveraging\nfunctionality\nfrom a 3rd-party service doesn‚Äôt mean we should allow that service‚Äôs UI to dictate what ours looks like. GitLab has its own\ndesign language\n, and by keeping it cohesive across the application, we create a significantly better experience for our users.\nBe transparent about the data source\nWhen data is populated from an external source, make it clear that it comes from elsewhere. This prevents confusion, reduces cognitive load, and ensures that users are well informed about the choices they‚Äôre making when interacting with the application.\nAvoid plugins and commercial marketplaces\nNote\n- We intend to provide a place where everyone can contribute, such as\ncode snippets\n,\nproject templates\nand CI components in the\nCI/CD Catalog\n. Marketplaces are traditionally transaction based, where users are purchasing solutions. GitLab CI/CD components on the other hand, will offer an in product experience for consuming components for YAML configuration from a library of\nGitLab maintained components\n.\nClosed source software vendors commonly depend on plugins and commercial marketplaces because:\nThese allow third parties the ability to add functionality without needing access to the underlying codebase.\nThird parties can charge for the plugins, which gives them an incentive to build them.\nBecause GitLab is an\nopen core product\n, third parties can add functionality directly to GitLab. Adding directly to the GitLab codebase (as opposed to building a plugin)\nmay\nmean more work for them and will limit the ways in which they can charge for that functionality.\nHowever, for\nusers of GitLab\n, this has significant advantages:\nThey are more likely to use this functionality, because it‚Äôs distributed to all users by default.\nThe functionality always works out of the box,\nrequiring no additional software\n.\nUsers don‚Äôt have to search for what plugins are available, or test multiple options to see which one works the best.\nInstallations can‚Äôt have varying combinations of plugins, making it easier to use and support the product.\nAdministrators never have to avoid an upgrade for fear that it might break an important plugin since all code is tested together.\nAnd for\ndevelopers of GitLab\nincluding the third parties, this has significant advantages as well:\nTheir work isn‚Äôt limited in functionality, because they‚Äôre changing the code of the product itself.\nTheir code will be tested along with the rest of the product as things change refactoring is easier, reducing the likelihood that it suffers from\nsoftware atrophy\nbecause something is hard to change.\nCommunity effort is not wasted on developing multiple plugins that all ultimately do the same thing and compete with each other for usage.\nDevelopers don‚Äôt have to sacrifice\nvelocity in favor of predictability\n, since they don‚Äôt have to worry about breaking the plugin API.\nOverall, we believe that this approach creates the best possible experience for both the users of and the contributors to GitLab, and to that end we encourage people to\ncontribute functionality to GitLab directly\n.\nIf adding code directly to GitLab isn‚Äôt an option, we encourage third-parties to integrate through our\nAPIs\n.\nNote: GitLab does support\nplugins that respond to system hooks\n, which tie directly to application events and are primarily used for administrative purposes such as auditing, logging, and other administrative tasks.\nProduct and feature naming guidelines\nGive products and features descriptive, not distinctive, names\nGitLab is a DevOps Platform, not a collection of DevOps point solutions; the naming of GitLab products and features should reflect this. Adopting descriptive names brings other advantages:\nIt‚Äôs\nefficient\n. Descriptive names are generally not eligible for trademark registration, avoiding the time, effort, and expense of clearing, filing, and maintaining trademark registrations.\nIt‚Äôs\ninclusive\n. Descriptive names are most accessible to a global audience because they can be directly translated into other languages, reducing the risk of loss of meaning inherent in translating abstract, metaphorical, or colloquial names.\nAs an\nexample\n,\nCI/CD Components Library\nis a descriptive name while\nis a distinctive name.\nExceptions to this principle are considered in limited circumstances - if a product or feature is a differentiator in the market, adopting a descriptive name risks it getting lost in the\nsea of same\n. Here, a distinctive name may be justified. To discuss an exception, reach out to\n#marketing\nin Slack.\nUse prepositions when referring to third-party products and services in names\nWhen naming a GitLab extension, plugin, app, or integration for a third-party product or service (a ‚Äútool‚Äù), either include the third-party service name with a preposition like\nfor\n, or don‚Äôt include it at all. A preposition is important as it indicates that the third party isn‚Äôt officially affiliated with the tool. For example, our\nintegration with Jira Cloud\nis called\nGitLab.com for Jira Cloud\n.\nProvided we use the tool‚Äôs full name in marketing materials and technical documentation, as exceptions to this general principle we can: (1) refer to the tool solely by the third-party service name in places where we list GitLab‚Äôs tools in product; and (2) refer to the tool solely as ‚ÄúGitLab‚Äù in the third-party product‚Äôs app directory. For example, we refer to the GitLab for Slack app as ‚ÄúSlack‚Äù in our lists of GitLab integrations, and as ‚ÄúGitLab‚Äù in the\nSlack App Directory\n.\nFor more guidance on the feature naming process, see\nnaming features\n.\nNext Generation\nWhile our\nbig, hairy, audacious goal\nspans all development processes, personas, and use-cases, there are primary targets in each one of these venues.\nWhen considering prioritization we should first aim to provide complete\nmaturity\nfor developers building cloud native applications in a modern way prior to moving to other development methodologies, personas, and application types.\nModern first\nWhen developing features to compete with existing competitors, make sure to\nsolve problems for modern development teams first, and\nthen\nsee what‚Äôs missing\nfor legacy teams. e.g. For project management, make great project management\ncapabilities for teams doing conversational development, lean, or even agile\ndevelopment before doing Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or waterfall.\nIt‚Äôs important that modern first does not mean non-modern never. It means that\nwe should first learn how teams are using the feature in a modern way, and then\nsee what‚Äôs missing. The modern way provides the path forward, and then we can add\ncustomizability or the path to modern for teams who are not quite there yet.\nDeveloper first\nOur strategy includes going after a lot of new personas, going from developers to\noperations, security, product managers, designers, etc. But when developing\nfeatures in these new areas, it‚Äôs important to remember to start with the\ndeveloper. If we can make security great for developers and\nthen\ngreat for\nsecurity professionals, we‚Äôll be much more successful.\nCloud-native first\nDevelopment teams deploy to tons of different platforms, from bare metal to\ncloud VMs to cloud-native Kubernetes clusters. We build features for\ncloud-native first, and\nthen\nsupport the rest. This allows us to focus on\nwhere development is going, and deliver solutions that every company aspires to\nuse eventually, even if they‚Äôre not ready to today.\nPrioritize current adopters\nBy focusing on next-generation development flows, personas, and use cases - we build features and experiences where our initial users are in the relatively small population of early adopters. While we might build experiences to support them today, we presume there will always be a much larger population of future users of these experiences. Therefore, we optimize GitLab to support the larger number of current and future adopters of next-generation principles - those who are beginning to operate in the workflow (modern), team setup (developer first), or application architectures (cloud native) we support. We focus our investment in the most modern workflows that will best support those current adopters. This will come at the cost of sustained investment in initial workflows for early adopters. When doing so we will ensure we clearly communicate with our users what the preferred path is.\nFor example - We first provided the ability to attach Kubernetes Clusters via the Certificate method. After realizing this wasn‚Äôt optimal for production use cases we added the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes method of cluster attachment. As soon as we were certain that the certificate method was no longer the preferred method we communicated via our docs and in the product that the Agent was the preferred path for current adopters. This should not mean an immediate\ndeprecation\n, but a clear signal that the legacy method will become deprecated once the alternative approach is able to substitute it.\nCustomer Support on all features\nWe provide customer support to paying customers on all features that are in the tier of their paid license as well as any lower tiers.\nThis means a feature in Core, should get customer support in all paid tiers.\nFor example, when there is a feature that is available in the lowest paid tier, but only has customer support in higher tiers,\nthe feature should be removed from that lowest paid tier.\nIn accordance with our\nstewardship policy\nwe can never remove features from Core into paid tiers,\nbut we can build additional features around it which are available to paying customers only.\nLast modified July 4, 2025:\nMove division specific includes to folder (\na74a8182\n)\nView page source\n-\nplease\ncontribute\n.", "num_words": 11190}
